CORPORATE PROFILE 

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. In addition, Regions operates several offices delivering specialty capabilities in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago and other locations nationwide. Regions provides financial solutions for a wide range of clients including retail and mortgage banking services, commercial banking services and wealth and investment services. Further, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver specialty capabilities including merger and acquisition advisory services, capital market solutions, home improvement lending and others. 

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. At June 30, 2023, Regions operated 1,276 total branch outlets. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions&#8217; segment reporting structure. 

Regions&#8217; business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking. 

Regions&#8217; profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions&#8217; net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions&#8217; market areas. 

SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW 

Second Quarter Operating Environment 

In the first six months of 2023, the banking industry was impacted by the failure of three U.S depository institutions. Outside of the U.S., an international bank also suffered a crisis in confidence. The circumstances surrounding these events were largely driven by a sudden decline in deposits and lack of available liquidity to replace the deposit declines at the institutions. In March 2023, the BTFP was created by the Federal Reserve to support American businesses and households by making additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, as an additional source of secured funding backed by high-quality securities, eliminating an institution&#8217;s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress. In addition to the uncertainty brought by these events, the Federal Reserve 

delivered three additional 25 basis-point rate hikes as inflation continued to stay above target levels. Accordingly, there is now heightened focus on the banking industry as a whole. Regions believes that its deposits are diversified across stable categories and are granular in nature which lessens the probability of sudden declines in deposits. Additionally, Regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations and performs various evaluations to determine appropriate levels of available liquidity. See the discussion below and within the "Debt Securities", "Deposits", "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for further information. 

Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets 

Regions' baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth of 2.0 percent in 2023 and 0.9 percent in 2024. The pace of economic activity remains restrained by elevated inflation and higher interest rates. Though real GDP growth surprised to the upside over the first half of 2023, Regions' forecast anticipates markedly slower growth over the coming quarters, reflecting slower growth in real consumer spending and weakness in business spending on equipment and machinery. Though single family construction and sales appear to have bottomed, it remains to be seen whether the developing rebound can withstand the recent upturn in mortgage interest rates. While the labor market remains tight, there are signs of cooling demand for labor, and job growth has become less broadly based over recent months. Though the pace of inflation has slowed, it remains considerably above the FOMC&#8217;s target rate and further hikes in the Fed funds rate in 2023 cannot be ruled out. The economic data and the financial markets remain quite volatile, and there are lingering concerns that credit conditions could tighten to the point the economy slips into recession. These factors are contributing to considerable uncertainty around the Company's near-term economic outlook. 

Spending on motor vehicles and discretionary services such as travel, tourism, recreation, entertainment, and dining out have been key supports for consumer spending over recent months. At some point, however, it is expected that spending in both areas will slow, combining with continued softness in consumer spending on goods to limit growth in total consumer spending. While there is still a considerable pool of excess savings on household balance sheets, those balances are being run off as the cumulative effects of higher inflation and higher interest rates continue to stress household budgets. That said, monthly debt service burdens remain below pre-pandemic levels, due to the preponderance of fixed-rate debt on household balance sheets. 

Reflecting decelerating job growth and declines in the average length of the workweek, growth in labor earnings has slowed, and will slow further over coming quarters if job growth slows as anticipated. Job growth has become less broadly based across private sector industry groups over recent months, with notable weakness in trade, transportation, and warehousing. Manufacturing payrolls have come under pressure as conditions in the factory sector remain challenging, reflecting dimming capital spending on equipment and machinery, inventories having largely been right-sized after pandemic-related disruptions, and slowing global economic growth. Regions' baseline forecast anticipates further deceleration in job growth to push the unemployment rate higher over coming quarters. 

While inflation has slowed somewhat over recent months, both headline and core inflation remain well above the FOMC&#8217;s 2.0 percent target rate. While inflation pressures are expected to ease further as the pace of the overall economic activity slows, the FOMC is not yet convinced inflation is firmly on a path back to their target rate. As such, further Fed funds rate hikes cannot be ruled out, particularly as headline inflation is showing signs of reaccelerating. The FOMC must balance concerns over inflation against concerns over financial stability in light of recent stresses in the banking system. Either way, once the FOMC reaches a stopping point, Regions thinks they will hold the funds rate steady at the terminal rate for some time to come. 

Patterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. A number of states within the footprint have seen heightened flows of domestic in-migration since the onset of the pandemic, which has resulted in more rapid rates of job growth and more rapid growth in housing costs. If, as anticipated, the broader economy slows and labor market conditions loosen, it could be that migration patterns will shift over coming quarters. That said, job growth for the Company's footprint as a whole is expected to be faster than that for the U.S. as a whole. Some of the metro areas which had, prior to the increase in mortgage interest rates, seen the largest increases in house prices could experience price declines in excess of the national average, but continued robust population growth in these markets will help stem significant declines in house prices. 

The continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of June 30, 2023. See the "Allowance" section for further information. 

Second Quarter Results 

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $556 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023 which was stable compared to net income available to common shareholders of $558 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2022. 

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 4.04 percent in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting a 98 basis point increase from the same period in 2022. The increases in net interest income and net interest margin were primarily driven by a significant increase in market interest rates and average loan growth. A decline in average cash 

balances also contributed to the increase in net interest margin. Higher deposit and overall funding costs, which are expected in a rising rate environment, partially offset the increases in interest income. 

The provision for credit losses totaled $118 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $60 million in the second quarter of 2022. The current quarter provision reflects continued normalization of asset quality, modest changes in the economic outlook and loan growth. Net charge-offs totaled $81 million, or 0.33 percent of average loans, in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $38 million, or 0.17 percent in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting increased net charge-offs in the commercial and industrial and other consumer loan portfolios. The allowance as a percent of total loans, net, increased slightly to 1.65 percent at June 30, 2023, compared to 1.63 percent at December 31, 2022. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail. 

Non-interest income was $576 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $640 million in second quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in capital markets income, mortgage income and service charges on deposit accounts. The declines were partially offset by improvements in investment service fee income and market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets. See Table 22 "Non-Interest Income" for further details. 

Non-interest expense was $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $948 million in second quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by increases across several categories, with the largest related to operational losses due to an increase in check fraud. See Table 23 "Non-Interest Expense" for further details. 

Regions' effective tax rate was 20.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 21.2 percent in the second quarter of 2022. See the "Income Taxes" section for further details. 

Capital 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies, which include quantitative requirements including the CET1 ratio. At June 30, 2023, Regions&#8217; CET1 ratio was estimated to be 10.07 percent. For additional information on Regions' regulatory capital requirements see the "Regulatory Requirements" section. 

Regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

The Board authorized, on April 20, 2022, the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company did not repurchase any shares in the first half of 2023. 

On July 19, 2023, the Board declared a 20 percent increase to the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.24 which will be payable on October 2, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 1, 2023.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $1.3 billion from year-end 2022 to June 30, 2023 resulting from a decrease in cash balances on deposit with the FRB. In the first six months of 2023, the decline in cash was driven by an expected decline in deposits and growth in loans, partially offset by an increase in borrowed funds. See the "Loans", "Liquidity", "Deposits", and "Borrowed Funds" sections for more information. 

DEBT SECURITIES 

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity: 

Table 1&#8212;Debt Securities 

June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; (In millions) U.S. Treasury securities $ 1,191 $ 1,187 Federal agency securities 926 836 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 2 2 Mortgage-backed securities: Residential agency 16,828 17,233 Residential non-agency &#8212; 1 Commercial agency 7,944 8,135 Commercial non-agency 81 186 Corporate and other debt securities 1,101 1,154 $ 28,073 $ 28,734 

Debt securities available for sale, comprising 20 percent of earning assets, constitute approximately 97 percent of the securities portfolio. They are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company, as much of the portfolio is highly liquid. Additionally, some of the securities portfolio is eligible to be used as collateral for funding of various types of borrowings. See the "Liquidity" section for more information on these arrangements. Regions maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency MBS. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" section for more information. 

The average life of the debt securities portfolio at June 30, 2023 was estimated to be 5.6 years, with a duration of approximately 4.7 years. These metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.8 years and a duration of approximately 4.8 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2022. 

Debt securities decreased $661 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in residential agency securities and commercial agency securities. In the first six months of 2023, Regions reinvested only a portion of principal paydowns and maturities. 

LOANS HELD FOR SALE 

Loans held for sale totaled $554 million at June 30, 2023, consisting of $257 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $267 million of commercial loans, $29 million of consumer and other performing loans, and $1 million of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2022, loans held for sale totaled $354 million, consisting of $160 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $153 million of commercial loans, $38 million of consumer and other performing loans, and $3 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real estate mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. Commercial loans held for sale include commercial mortgage loans originated for sale to third parties and commercial loans originally recorded as held for investment when management has the intent to sell. Levels of commercial loans held for sale fluctuate based on timing of sale to third parties. 

LOANS 

Loans, net of unearned income, represented 73 percent of interest-earning assets as of June 30, 2023. The following table presents the distribution of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio by portfolio segment and class, net of unearned income: 

Table 2&#8212;Loan Portfolio 

June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; (In millions, net of unearned income) Commercial and industrial $ 52,300 $ 50,905 Commercial real estate mortgage&#8212;owner-occupied 4,797 5,103 Commercial real estate construction&#8212;owner-occupied 292 298 Total commercial 57,389 56,306 Commercial investor real estate mortgage 6,500 6,393 Commercial investor real estate construction 2,132 1,986 Total investor real estate 8,632 8,379 Residential first mortgage 19,755 18,810 Home equity lines 3,313 3,510 Home equity loans 2,425 2,489 Consumer credit card 1,231 1,248 Other consumer&#8212;exit portfolios 416 570 Other consumer 6,030 5,697 Total consumer 33,170 32,324 $ 99,191 $ 97,009 

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 2 , explain changes in balances from year-end 2022 and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

Commercial 

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial and industrial loans increased $1.1 billion since year-end 2022, driven by a continued increase in line commitments. In the first six months of 2023, commercial and industrial loan growth was broad-based, primarily driven by increases in the utilities, information (including telecommunications), energy, real estate, and retail trade industries. 

The commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing on land and buildings, and are repaid by cash generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. 

Over half of the Company&#8217;s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. 

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in selected industries.

(1) "Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related. 

(2) "Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level. 

(3) As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted. 

Investor Real Estate 

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans increased $253 million in comparison to year-end 2022 balances. 

The Company's total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending consists of both unsecured commercial and industrial loans that are real estate related (including REITs) and investor real estate loans and are considered to be well diversified across property types. The following table provides detail of these loans:

_______ 

(1) Owner-occupied commercial real estate is not included as the principal source of repayment is individual businesses, which more closely aligns with the commercial portfolio credit performance. 

(2) Amounts calculated based on whole dollar values. 

Residential First Mortgage 

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. These loans increased $945 million in comparison to year-end 2022 balances, driven by approximately $1.6 billion in new loan originations retained on the balance sheet through the first six months of 2023. 

Home Equity Lines 

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased $197 million in comparison to year-end 2022 balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term &#8220;balloon payment&#8221; means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. 

The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of June 30, 2023. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans 

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Consumer Credit Quality Data 

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (&#8220;current LTV&#8221;). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the &#8220;Above 100%&#8221; category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Consumer Credit Card 

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. 

Other Consumer&#8212;Exit Portfolios 

Other consumer &#8212; exit portfolios includes lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other point of sale lending. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balance has decreased $154 million from year-end 2022. 

Other Consumer 

Other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $333 million from year-end 2022 primarily driven by increases in consumer home improvement loans. 

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for most consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses". 

ALLOWANCE 

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. 

The allowance totaled $1.6 billion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change in the 

allowance are presented in Table 7 below. While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base forecast over the two-year R&#38;S forecast period as of June 30, 2023. The unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the allowance models and continues to be at a normalized level with forecasted periods expected to remain relatively consistent.

In deriving any forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. Regions' June 2023 baseline forecast weakened compared to the March 2023 forecast driven by several factors. Weak growth in real GDP is expected in 2023, with weakness in real private domestic demand expected to be weak for the remainder of 2023. As business investment in equipment and machinery contracts, intellectual property products remain the key driver of growth in overall business investment. A slowdown in job growth is anticipated, as well as a low labor force participation rate that will limit any increase in the unemployment rate over the forecast horizon. As measured by CPI, inflation is expected to slow further but remain above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target into 2024. Renewed disruptions in global supply chains, excessive monetary policy tightening, and heightened financial volatility provide significant downside uncertainty over the near-term forecast. See the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets discussion in the "Second Quarter Overview" section for additional information. 

Credit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter in order to understand external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. In the second quarter of 2023, asset quality continued to normalize, as expected, within certain select sectors of the commercial and consumer portfolios. Total net charge-offs remained stable, decreasing by $2 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances increased approximately $314 million, which included a decrease in classified balances of $51 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non-performing assets both decreased approximately $62 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. 

While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. In the second quarter of 2023 the general imprecision remained stable due to uncertainty. 

Based upon the factors discussed above, the June 30, 2023 allowance increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to uncertainty in the economic forecast, loan growth, continued credit normalization and qualitative considerations. Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of $1.6 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of June 30, 2023. 

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from previous years' totals, are included in Table 9 "Allowance for Credit Losses". Net charge-offs increased $80 million year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial and other consumer net charge-offs. As noted, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, collateral valuations and inflationary pressure will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of 2023 and beyond. See the "Second Quarter Overview" section for details on expectations for net charge-offs in 2023.

GOODWILL 

Goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 9 "Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the methodologies and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis. 

DEPOSITS 

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions&#8217; ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers&#8217; needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services through the Company's digital channels and contact center. 

The following table summarizes deposits by category and by segment:

____` 

(1) Other deposits represent non-customer balances primarily consisting of wholesale funding (for example, Eurodollar trade deposits, selected deposits and brokered time deposits). 

(2) Includes brokered deposits totaling $2.0 billion at June 30, 2023 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Total deposits at June 30, 2023 decreased approximately $4.8 billion compared to year-end 2022 levels, largely in line with expectations. Consumer and wealth management deposits declined by approximately $3.9 billion with declines across most interest-bearing products, partially offset by an increase in time deposits, reflecting continued rate-seeking behavior of higher-balance customers. Corporate deposits declined approximately $1.8 billion, primarily in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, also driven by rate-seeking behavior and utilization of off-balance sheet funding solutions. These deposit declines were offset by an increase of other segment deposits of approximately $897 million reflecting additional brokered deposits entered into in the second quarter to maintain diversified funding sources. 

Regions believes that its deposits are diversified across stable categories and include insured and collateralized deposits, with consumer deposits making up more than 60 percent of the total deposit base. Furthermore, corporate deposits include those that are operational in nature (where the primary use is certain operational services such as clearing, custody, payments or other cash management activities). A significant amount of the Company's deposit base is insured by the FDIC or collateralized, with approximately $7.5 billion in deposits collateralized in public funds or in trusts at June 30, 2023. The amount of estimated uninsured deposits totaled $47.3 billion at June 30, 2023, therefore over 60 percent of total deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Company's deposits are also granular in nature as evidenced by an average deposit account balance of approximately $18 thousand at June 30, 2023. The estimates of uninsured deposits and average account size were based on methodologies used in the Company's Call Report, which is prepared on an unconsolidated bank basis. 

See the "Second Quarter Overview" section for details on expectations for deposits in 2023. See also the "Liquidity" and "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" sections for further discussion. 

BORROWED FUNDS 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, were $3.0 billion at June 30, 2023, and there were no short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022. The levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the sources utilized. 

Short and long-term funding from the FHLB and FRB are secured by pledged assets, primarily certain loan portfolios which are also subject to blanket lien arrangements with the FHLB and FRB. As of June 30, 2023, Regions' blanket lien arrangements with these entities covered a total loan balance of approximately $94.1 billion and included loans from various loan portfolios. However, borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB is contingent on a subset of the blanket lien portfolios which are eligible and pledged according to the parameters for each counterparty. 

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a portion of Regions' funding strategy. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-term borrowings increased by approximately $2.0 billion from year-end 2022 as the Company utilized FHLB advances during the second quarter of 2023. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB. 

Ratings 

The Company's credit ratings reflect the debt ratings information of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank by Standard and Poor's, Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and Dominion Bond Rating Service Morningstar. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no changes to the Company's ratings by any of the aforementioned ratings agencies compared to December 31, 2022. See the "Ratings" section of Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

As part of an industry-wide evaluation, on August 7, 2023, Moody's affirmed all long-term and short-term ratings and updated the outlook to negative from stable reflecting several sources of strain on the U.S. banking sector. 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

CAPITAL RULES 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under the FRB's rules for tailoring enhanced prudential standards. 

Federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. At June 30, 2023, the net impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $204 million or approximately 16 basis points. The add-back amount will decrease by approximately $100 million each year, or approximately 8 basis points, in the first quarters of 2024 and 2025. 

Regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.

Proposed new rules for U.S. implementation of capital requirements under Basel IV rules, more recently referred to as the Basel III "Endgame", were issued on July 27, 2023. These proposed rules include broad-based changes to the risk-weighting framework for various credit exposures and operational risk capital requirements. The Company is studying the proposals and evaluating their impacts. Additional discussion of the current Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the "Supervision and Regulation" subsection of the "Business" section in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion and is also included in Note 12 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIQUIDITY 

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions&#8217; Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with Regions&#8217; operating model and risk profile. 

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Liquidity Requirements&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section, the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

SHAREHOLDERS' AND TOTAL EQUITY 

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $16.6 billion at June 30, 2023 as compared to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2022. During the first six months of 2023, net income increased shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion, cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $374 million, and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $49 million. Changes in AOCI decreased shareholders' equity by $97 million, primarily due to derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The cumulative effect from the adoption of new accounting guidance that eliminated TDRs and created modifications to troubled borrowers increased shareholders' equity by $28 million . 

Total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $22 million and $4 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The noncontrolling interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which Regions held the majority interest at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" section for additional information. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which excludes certain adjustments that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest income", "adjusted total revenue", "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent basis", and "adjusted operating leverage ratio". Regions believes that excluding certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparison, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions&#8217; business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

&#8226; Preparation of Regions&#8217; operating budgets 

&#8226; Monthly financial performance reporting 

&#8226; Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results 

&#8226; Presentations to investors of Company performance 

&#8226; Metrics for incentive compensation 

Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) is presented with taxable-equivalent adjustments to arrive at net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP). Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP). Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP) and adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). The adjusted operating leverage ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is calculated as the year over year percentage change in adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) less the year over year percentage change in adjusted total non-interest expense (non-GAAP). Management uses this ratio to monitor performance and believes it provides meaningful information to investors. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders. 

The following table provides: 1) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 3) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 4) a computation of adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) and 5) presentation of the operating leverage ratio (GAAP) and the adjusted operating leverage ratio (non-GAAP).

(6) The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit. 

Net interest income is Regions&#8217; principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of Regions&#8217; ability to meet its overall performance goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and in the first six months of 2023, the FOMC increased the Fed funds rate by 75 basis points. See the "Second Quarter Overview" for a discussion of recent FOMC activity. 

Net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) and net interest margin increased in both the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were driven primarily by significantly higher short-term and long-term interest rates and higher average loan balances. Higher deposit and funding costs, due to the rising rate environment, partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;INTEREST RATE RISK 

Regions&#8217; primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the 

financial products and services that the Company offers. As its primary tool to analyze this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions&#8217; interest rate risk. 

In addition to net interest income simulations, Regions also utilizes an EVE analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longer-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current balance sheet, does not incorporate the balance sheet growth assumptions used in the net interest income sensitivity analyses, and results are highly dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. The imprecise assumptions in preparing an EVE analysis limit its efficacy. 

Sensitivity Measurement&#8212;Financial simulation models are Regions&#8217; primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions&#8217; balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using &#8220;market forward rates.&#8221; See the "Second Quarter Overview" section for details on expectations for net interest income in 2023. The set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes. In addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. 

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements&#8212;Regions' balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive, with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates, and decreasing with lower interest rates. This is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices, and funding from a large, mostly stable retail deposit portfolio. Importantly, the stability and rate sensitivity of Regions' deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles. With this natural balance sheet profile, the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through cash flow hedges is critical for interest rate risk management. As of June 30, 2023, Regions evidenced a mostly balanced asset/liability position, with an asset duration of approximately 2.7 years and a liability duration of approximately 2.9 years, using historically-informed approximations. The securities portfolio duration was approximately 4.7 years and is appropriate for Regions' risk profile in order to offset the long-duration deposit liabilities. While the available for sale securities and cash flow hedging portfolios are recorded on the balance sheet including current unrealized losses, deposit value increases have more than offset these losses through the rising rate environment. The additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment will be realized in the form of lower-cost funding when compared with wholesale sources. Deposits are recorded on the balance sheet at carrying value and, for certain financial statement footnote disclosures, the estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is equal to their carrying value, consistent with industry practices. However, in the sensitivity analysis of the balance sheet management does contemplate a fair value of deposits with no stated maturity. See Note 9 "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

As of June 30, 2023, Regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending June 2024. The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in Table 18 below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves, SOFR and BSBY) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. Under either environment, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset the change in asset yields. 

Net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long-term yield curve tenors. While this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises and remains elevated. An increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swaps and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. The opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall. 

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 18 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with tightening monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity, management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results. 

The Company&#8217;s baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming 12 months. In the first six months of 2023, Regions experienced a decline in low-cost deposit balances, both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies, as well as from late-cycle rate seeking behavior by higher-balance customers. The baseline projects deposit balances to decline modestly through the end of the year. Assuming runoff mimics the expected total deposit mix, an additional deposit outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by $26 million over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in Table 18. Conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained a positive benefit of $26 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in Table 18. 

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some remixing shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3.5 billion over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in Table 18. Furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $28 million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by $28 million. 

The deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. In the base case scenario, management expects an approximate 35 percent full cycle interest-bearing deposit beta by year-end 2023, and for the beta to drift towards 40 percent in 2024. The parallel +100 basis point shock scenario in Table 18 also incorporates an incremental beta of approximately 45 percent above the base case scenario. Incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in the parallel +100 basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $40 million. 

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 19 and its accompanying description.

(1) Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing. 

(2) All active cash flow hedges, including forward starting hedges, are reflected within the measurement horizon. See Table 20 for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates. 

Regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives, as discussed further below, and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position. 

During the second quarter of 2023, the Company did not engage in meaningful hedging transactions. 

Since June 30, 2023, the Company executed transactions to opportunistically extend incremental downside rate protection over a longer horizon and reduce exposure to large falling rate movements. The Company added $1.0 billion of forward starting swaps, which will become active in 2026 and mature 3 years from their start dates. The receive fixed rates on these cash flow 

hedges averaged 3.48 percent, paying overnight SOFR. The Company also added $500 million of forward starting interest rate options, which will become active in 2025 and mature 4 years from their start dates. These options were constructed with net purchased interest rate floors at a weighted-average strike of 2.00 percent. To offset the cost of these floors, the strategy includes sold interest rate caps with a weighted-average strike of 6.20 percent. 

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions&#8217; securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Derivatives &#8212;Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions&#8217; senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, forward sale commitments, futures contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate options (caps, floors and collars), and contracts with a combination of these instruments. 

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform. 

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. 

The following table presents additional information about hedging interest rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk. 

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 

The primary objective of Regions&#8217; hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions&#8217; execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. 

See Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions&#8217; year-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions&#8217; current portfolio. 

LIBOR TRANSITION 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR would not be available for use after December 31, 2021 and would not be published after June 30, 2023. Regions ceased origination of all new LIBOR-based lending on December 31, 2021. Further, on March 15, 2022, the LIBOR Act was signed into law with the purpose of establishing a clear and uniform process for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts upon the formal cessation of USD LIBOR. Among the provisions of this legislation, contracts may be transitioned to SOFR to gain a legal safe harbor. The Company has assessed the impact of this legislation and allowed certain clients to fallback to SOFR upon the cessation of LIBOR, consistent with the guidelines in the legislation. 

Through the first half of 2023, the Company continued to make progress on its LIBOR transition goals. On June 9, 2023, the Company announced the replacement of LIBOR with a three-month CME Term SOFR reference rate on Series B and Series C preferred stock when the instruments convert to a floating rate on their respective conversion dates (see Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" for further details). 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company held instruments that were impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including $3.3 billion in loans and $215 million in investment securities. All remaining LIBOR loans and securities will transition in accordance with the terms delineated in the LIBOR Act on their next reset date through the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024 with an estimated 15 percent of total remaining LIBOR balances outstanding at December 31, 2023. Regions is not impacted by the introduction of synthetic LIBOR within its loan portfolio. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company held $77.4 billion in derivative products that were impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. All remaining LIBOR derivatives will transition to SOFR in accordance with the LIBOR Act on their next reset date through the period ending October 3, 2023. 

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for details. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions&#8217; ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers. Regions&#8217; goal in liquidity management is to maintain diverse liquidity sources and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further described below. See also Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk. 

Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans, and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by Regions' deposit base. 

Cash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation. As part of its normal management practice, Regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as FHLB, FRB or BTFP on a same-day basis (subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants). While the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity, the secured borrowing capabilities, in addition to cash reserves on hand, assist in alleviating the Company's need to sell securities for funding purposes. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets. 

The following table summarizes the Company's available sources of liquidity as of June 30, 2023: 

Table 21&#8212;Liquidity Sources 

Availability as of June 30, 2023 

(in billions) 

Cash at the FRB (1) 

$ 7.4 

Liquid securities free to use, including at BTFP (2)

____ 

(1) Includes small in transit items that may not yet be reflected in the Fed master account closing balance. 

(2) Securities pledged under the BTFP are measured at par value, as provided in the program, resulting in additional collateral of approximately $1.9 billion at June 30, 2023. 

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line item &#8220;interest-bearing deposits in other banks.&#8221; At June 30, 2023, Regions had approximately $7.4 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB and other depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $9.2 billion at December 31, 2022, partially driven by the expected decline in deposits during the period. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" and "Deposits" sections for more information. 

The securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements, including the BTFP. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP as an additional liquidity source, under which securities may be pledged at their par value for a lending arrangement up to one year in length. Regions' securities portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency securities, MBS and corporate and other debt. In evaluating the liquidity within the securities portfolio, "liquid securities free to use" are primarily comprised of U.S Treasury securities and agency MBS. These highly liquid securities include free to pledge securities as well as the incremental borrowing availability under the BTFP, which is based on collateral values being measured at par value under the program. Additionally, certain corporate bonds are considered to be highly liquid. Other unencumbered securities, primarily non-agency commercial MBS, also serve as a source of liquidity. 

Regions&#8217; financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of June 30, 2023, Regions had $3.0 billion in short-term FHLB borrowings, $2.0 billion in long-term FHLB borrowings and had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB, as shown in Table 21. FHLB borrowing capacity is determined based on eligible securities and loan amounts that can be used in collateral for future borrowing capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 

Regions has additional borrowing availability with the FRB through the discount window as shown in Table 21. FRB borrowing capacity is determined based on eligible loan amounts that can be used as collateral for future borrowing capacity. 

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 11 "Borrowed Funds" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $2.2 billion at June 30, 2023. Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits. 

CREDIT RISK 

Regions&#8217; objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. See further discussion of the current U.S. economic environment in the "Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets" section. 

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems. Such attempts have increased in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees. 

Even when Regions successfully prevents cyber-attacks to its own network, the Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer transactions. The related fraud losses, as well as the costs of re-issuing new cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk. 

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further discussion of Regions' information security risk. 

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses totaled $118 million during the second quarter of 2023 compared to $60 million during the second quarter 2022. The provision for credit losses totaled $253 million for the first six months of 2023 compared to $24 million for the first six months of 2022. Refer to the "Allowance" section for further detail.

NM - Not Meaningful 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, corporate analysis service charges, non-sufficient fund fees, and other customer transaction-related service charges. During the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, service charges decreased compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily as a result of overdraft-related policy enhancements that eliminated non-sufficient fund fees in mid-June 2022. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2023, the Company added Regions' Overdraft Grace feature, which compliments the overdraft-related policy enhancements. An increase in fees from treasury management services partially offset the overall decline in service charges. 

Capital Markets Income 

Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Capital markets income decreased in the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, driven primarily by negative credit/debit valuation adjustments due to rate and spread movements. To a lesser degree, capital markets was negatively impacted by declines in syndication revenue and M&#38;A advisory fees. Partially offsetting these decreases was an 

increase in securities underwriting and placement fees in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. 

Mortgage Income 

Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decrease in mortgage income in the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was due primarily to lower mortgage production and sales as a result of higher market interest rates. Additionally, mortgage income for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included approximately $12 million in gains associated with the re-securitization and sale of Ginnie Mae loans previously repurchased from their pools. 

Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $6.2 billion in residential mortgage loans. 

Investment Services Fee Income 

Investment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. Investment services fee income increased during the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to the rising interest rate environment, which has driven increases in fixed annuity rates and the related investment income. Also contributing were increases in assets under management due to additional financial advisors. 

Commercial Credit Fee Income 

Commercial credit fee income includes letters of credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees. Commercial credit fee income increased during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 driven primarily by an increase in unused commercial line fees. 

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets 

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. Unfavorable market value adjustments on employee benefit assets decreased in the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due to market volatility. The adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense. 

Securities Gains (Losses), net 

Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt Securities" section and Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Other Miscellaneous Income 

Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income decreased in the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to a decline in commercial loan and leasing related fee income and a customer's bankruptcy-related distribution in the second quarter of 2022 that did not repeat.

Salaries and Employee Benefits 

Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased in the second quarter of 2023 and the first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to increases in base salaries and higher benefit expenses partially offset by a decline in incentive compensation. Full-time equivalent headcount increased to 20,349 at June 30, 2023 from 19,673 at June 30, 2022 further contributing to the increase in salaries and employee benefits. 

Credit/checkcard Expenses 

Credit/checkcard expenses include credit and checkcard fraud and expenses. Credit/checkcard expenses decreased in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to a debit card accrual increase in the first quarter of 2022 related to a previous matter that did not repeat. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

FDIC insurance assessments increased in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher FDIC premium expenses primarily resulting from a two basis point increase in the quarterly assessment rate schedules charged to all financial institutions effective for the first quarter of 2023. To a lesser degree, changes in other factors including continued credit normalization and declining cash balances contributed to the increase. 

The FDIC has estimated losses resulting from recent large regional institution failures, including the portion attributable to protection of uninsured depositors under the Systemic Risk Exception. Federal law requires that any losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund related to this action be repaid by a special assessment on banks. In the second quarter of 2023, the FDIC released a proposal for the special assessment related to the two March 2023 bank failures, estimated at $15.8 billion. The assessment to cover these losses is proposed to be paid at an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in the first quarter of 2024. If the proposal is finalized as drafted, Regions would pay approximately $111 million. The full amount would be accrued concurrent with the finalization of the rule. Regions expects the special assessment to be deductible for income taxes. 

Operational Losses 

Operational losses include losses related to fraud, execution, delivery and process management, and damage to physical assets. Operational losses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due to elevated fraud losses stemming from a spike in check fraud in the second quarter of 2023; however, the Company has since implemented effective countermeasures and losses have returned to normalized levels. An increasing fraud loss trend has been experienced by banks across the industry. 

Branch Consolidation, Property and Equipment Charges 

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company recognized gains on the disposition of branch properties. 

Other Miscellaneous Expenses 

Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses increased in the second quarter of 2023 and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to higher non-service based pension-related expenses and, to a lesser degree, higher fees associated with licenses and taxes. 

INCOME TAXES 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $147 million compared to $157 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, resulting in effective tax rates of 20.2 percent and 21.2 percent, respectively. The Company&#8217;s income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $324 million compared to $311 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.4 percent and 21.6 percent, respectively. See the "Second Quarter Overview" for the Company's near-term expectations for future tax rates. 

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

At June 30, 2023, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $955 million compared to $943 million at December 31, 2022.
