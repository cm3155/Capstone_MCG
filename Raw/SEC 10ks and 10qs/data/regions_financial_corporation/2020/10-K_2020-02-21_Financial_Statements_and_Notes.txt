 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

We, as members of the Management of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Regions&#8217; internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#8217;s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 

All internal controls systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements in the Company&#8217;s financial statements, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Regions&#8217; management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in its 2013 Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe and assert that, as of December 31, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 

Regions&#8217; independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on the following page.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial Corporation 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries&#8217; internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical audit matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for loan losses 

Description of the Matter 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio totaled $83.0 billion as of December 31, 2019, and the associated allowance for loan losses (ALL) was $869 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the ALL is established to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Management&#8217;s estimate for the probable credit losses is established through quantitative, as well as qualitative, factors. The Company attributes portions of the allowance to loans that it evaluates individually and determines to be impaired and to groups of loans that it evaluates collectively. For non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans equal to or greater than $2.5 million, the allowance for loan losses is based on the present value of estimated cash flows, estimates of collateral value, or observable market prices. For accruing commercial and investor real estate loans and non-accruing commercial and investor real estate loans less than $2.5 million, as well as for consumer loans, the allowance for loan losses is estimated based on historical default and/or loss information for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and product types. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the appropriate ALL also considers the imprecision inherent in the estimation process. As a result, management adjusts the ALL for consideration of the potential impact of qualitative factors, which include credit quality trends; loss experience in particular portfolios; macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, real estate prices, or commodity pricing volatility; changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; shifts in credit quality of customers which is not yet reflected in historical data; and volatility associated with large individual credits, among others. 

Auditing management&#8217;s estimate of the ALL involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the qualitative factors that management assessed and the measurement of each qualitative factor. Management&#8217;s assessment and measurement of the qualitative factors is highly judgmental and has a significant effect on the ALL. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

&#160; 

Our audit procedures related to the qualitative factors of the ALL included the following procedures, among others. We gained an understanding of the Company&#8217;s process for establishing the ALL, including the identification and measurement of qualitative factors. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relevant to that process, including controls over credit risk management, the reliability of data sourced from the loan systems and credit warehouses, the completeness and accuracy of quantitative loss modeling, and the ALL methodology and assumptions. In doing so, we tested review and approval controls in the Company&#8217;s governance process designed to identify and assess the need for and measurement of qualitative factors to estimate inherent credit losses associated with factors not captured fully in the quantitative components of the ALL. 

With respect to the identification of qualitative factors, we evaluated 1) the potential impact of imprecision in the quantitative models (and hence the need to consider a qualitative adjustment to the ALL); 2) changes, assumptions and adjustments to the models; 3) sufficiency, availability and relevance of historical loss data used in the models; and 4) the risk factors used in the models. Regarding measurement of the qualitative factors, we evaluated internal data utilized by management to estimate the appropriate level of the qualitative factors, as well as internal data produced by the Company&#8217;s Credit Review, Internal Audit and Model Validation groups, and external macroeconomic factors independently obtained during the audit, with consideration given to the reliability of the macroeconomic factors and existence of new and potentially contradictory information. We also evaluated the overall allowance for loan losses balance taken as a whole inclusive of such qualitative factors.

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Re gions Financial Corporation (&#8220;Regions&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) provides a full range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain of those regulatory authorities. 

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements including, but not limited to, the estimates and assumptions related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements, intangibles, residential MSRs and income taxes. 

Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance related to several accounting topics. The cumulative effect of the retrospective application had an immaterial impact on retained earnings. All prior period amounts impacted by guidance that required retrospective application have been revised. 

Certain amounts in prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, except as otherwise noted. These reclassifications are immaterial and have no effect on net income, comprehensive income (loss), total assets or total stockholders&#8217; equity as previously reported. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regions, its subsidiaries and certain VIEs. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Regions considers a voting rights entity to be a subsidiary and consolidates it if Regions has a controlling financial interest in the entity. VIEs are consolidated if Regions has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that significantly impact financial performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., Regions is the primary beneficiary). The determination of whether Regions is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is reassessed on an ongoing basis. Investments in companies which are not VIEs but in which Regions has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in VIEs, where Regions is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, are accounted for using either the proportional amortization method or the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as are other loans and are generally secured. Refer to Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding Regions&#8217; significant VIEs. 

Unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method and do not have a readily determinable fair value are accounted for at cost under the measurement alternative with adjustments for impairment and observable price changes as applicable. Cost method investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends received or receivable and observable price changes from these investments are included as a component of other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. 

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&#38;T Insurance Holdings, Inc. The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into an agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related affiliates. The transaction closed on April 2, 2012. Results of operations for the entities sold are presented separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of income. Other expenses related to the transaction are also included in discontinued operations. See Note 3 and Note 24 for further discussion. 

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOWS 

Cash equivalents represent assets that can be converted into cash immediately. At Regions, these assets include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired, are classified at that time according to management&#8217;s intent to either sell or hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management&#8217;s intent is to sell the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented 

as operating cash flows. When management&#8217;s intent is to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, the cash flows of that loan are presented as investing cash flows. 

The following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31 : &#160;

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE 

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions. It is Regions&#8217; policy to take possession of securities purchased under resell agreements either through direct delivery or a tri-party agreement. 

DEBT SECURITIES 

Management determines the appropriate accounting classification of debt securities at the time of purchase, based on intent, and periodically re-evaluates such designations. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities held to maturity are presented at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale. Debt securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). See the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section below for discussion of determining fair value. 

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security, using the interest method. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income on securities. Realized gains and losses are included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 

The Company reviews its securities portfolio on a regular basis to determine if there are any conditions indicating that a security has other-than-temporary impairment. For debt securities, factors include the credit standing of the issuer, whether the Company expects to receive all scheduled principal and interest payments, Regions&#8217; intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before its market value recovers. For debt securities, activity related to the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings as part of net securities gains (losses). Refer to Note 4 for further detail and information on securities. 

LOANS HELD FOR SALE 

Regions&#8217; loans held for sale include commercial loans, investor real estate loans and residential real estate mortgage loans. Loans held for sale are recorded at either estimated fair value, if the fair value option is elected, or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Regions has elected to account for residential real estate mortgages originated with the intent to sell at fair value. Intent is established for these conforming residential real estate mortgage loans when Regions enters into an interest rate lock commitment. Gains and losses on these residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value option has been elected are included in mortgage income. Certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale where management has elected the fair value option are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses on commercial mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value option has been elected are included in capital markets income. Regions also transfers certain commercial, investor real estate, and residential real estate mortgage portfolio loans to held for sale when management has the intent to sell in the near term. These held for sale loans are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. At the time of transfer, write-downs on the loans are recorded as charge-offs when credit related and non-interest expense when not credit related and a new cost basis is established. Any subsequent lower of cost or market adjustment is determined on an individual loan basis and is recognized in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses on the sale of non-performing commercial and investor real estate loans are included in other non-interest expense. See the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section below for discussion of determining estimated fair value. 

LOANS 

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are considered loans held for investment (or portfolio loans). Loans held for investment are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of premiums, discounts, unearned income and deferred loan fees and costs. Regions' loans balance is comprised of commercial, investor real estate and consumer loans. Interest income on all types of loans is accrued based on the contractual interest rate and the principal amount outstanding using methods that approximate the interest method, except for those loans classified as non-accrual. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans and non-refundable loan origination and commitment fees, net of direct costs of originating or acquiring loans, are deferred and recognized over the estimated lives of the related loans as an adjustment to the loans&#8217; constant effective yield, which is included in interest income on loans. Direct financing, sales-type and leveraged leases are included within the commercial portfolio segment. See Note 5 for further detail and information on loans and Note 14 for further detail on leases. 

Regions determines past due or delinquency status of a loan based on contractual payment terms. 

Commercial and investor real estate loans are placed on non-accrual if any of the following conditions occur: 1) collection in full of contractual principal and interest is no longer reasonably assured (even if current as to payment status), 2) a partial charge-off has occurred, unless the loan has been brought current under its contractual terms (original or restructured terms) and the full originally contracted principal and interest is considered to be fully collectible, or 3) the loan is delinquent on any principal or interest for 90 days or more unless the obligation is secured by collateral having a net realizable value (estimated fair value less costs to sell) sufficient to fully discharge the obligation and the loan is in the legal process of collection. Factors considered regarding full collection include assessment of changes in borrower&#8217;s cash flow, valuation of underlying collateral, ability and willingness of guarantors to provide credit support, and other conditions. Charge-offs on commercial and investor real estate loans are primarily based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan and occur when available information confirms the loan is not or will not be fully collectible. Factors considered in making these determinations are the borrower&#8217;s and any guarantor&#8217;s ability and willingness to pay, the status of the account in bankruptcy court (if applicable), and collateral value. Commercial and investor real estate loan relationships of $ 250,000 or less are subject to charge-off or charge down to estimated fair value at 180 days past due, based on collateral value. 

Non-accrual and charge-off decisions for consumer loans are dictated by the FFIEC's Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy which establishes standards for the classification and treatment of consumer loans. The charge-off process drives consumer non-accrual status as follows. If a consumer loan secured by real estate in a first lien position (residential first mortgage or home equity) becomes 180 days past due, Regions evaluates the loan for non-accrual status and potential charge-off based on net loan to value exposure. For home equity loans and lines of credit in a second lien position, the evaluation is performed at 120 days past due. If a loan is secured by collateral having a net realizable value sufficient to fully discharge the obligation, then a partial write-down is not necessary and the loan remains on accrual status, provided it is in the process of legal collection. If a partial charge-off is necessary as a result of the evaluation, then the remaining balance is placed on non-accrual. Consumer loans not secured by real estate are generally charged-off at either 120 days past due for closed-end loans, 180 days past due for open-end loans other than credit cards or the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due for credit cards. 

When loans are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and amortization/accretion of deferred net loan fees/costs are discontinued. When a commercial or investor real estate loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed and charged to interest income. Uncollected interest accrued from prior years on commercial and investor real estate loans placed on non-accrual status in the current year is charged against the allowance for loan losses. When a consumer loan is placed on non-accrual status, all uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income due to immateriality. Interest collections on commercial and investor real estate non-accrual loans are applied as principal reductions. Interest collections on consumer loans are recorded using the cash basis, due to immateriality. 

All loans on non-accrual status may be returned to accrual status and interest accrual resumed if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the loan is brought contractually current as to both principal and interest, 2) future payments are reasonably expected to continue being received in accordance with the terms of the loan and repayment ability can be reasonably demonstrated, and 3) the loan has been performing for at least six months. 

TDRs 

TDRs are loans in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time of restructuring, and Regions has granted a concession to the borrower. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan and may take the form of modifications made with the stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in limited circumstances forgiveness of principal and/or interest. TDRs can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. TDRs are subject to policies governing accrual/non-accrual evaluation consistent with all other loans of the same product type as discussed in the &#8220;Loans&#8221; section above. 

All loans with the TDR designation are considered to be impaired, even if they are accruing. See the &#8220;Calculation of Allowance For Credit Losses&#8221; section below for Regions&#8217; allowance for loan losses methodology related to TDRs. 

The CAP was designed to evaluate potential consumer loan participants as early as possible in the life cycle of the troubled loan (as described in Note 6 ). Many of the modifications are finalized without the borrower ever reaching the applicable number of days past due, and therefore the loan may never be placed on non-accrual. Accordingly, given the positive impact of the restructuring on the likelihood of recovery of cash flows due under the modified terms, accrual status continues to be appropriate for these loans. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Regions' allowance for credit losses (&#8220;allowance&#8221;) consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses, which is recorded as a contra-asset to loans, and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities. The allowance is reduced by actual losses (charge-offs) and increased by recoveries, if any. Regions charges losses against the allowance in the period the loss is confirmed. All adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are charged directly to expense through the provision for loan losses. All adjustments to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments are recorded in other non-interest expense. 

The allowance is maintained at a level believed appropriate by management to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan and unfunded credit commitment portfolios in accordance with GAAP and regulatory guidelines. Management&#8217;s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is a quarterly process and is based on an evaluation and rating of the loan portfolio segments, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions, collateral values securing loans, levels of problem loans, volume, growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio, regulatory guidance, and other relevant factors. Changes in any of these, or other factors, or the availability of new information, could require that the allowance be adjusted in future periods. Actual losses could vary from management&#8217;s estimates. Management attributes portions of the allowance to loans that it evaluates and determines to be impaired and to groups of loans that it evaluates collectively. However, the entire allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the loan portfolio. 

CALCULATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Commercial and Investor Real Estate Components 

Impaired Loans 

Loans deemed to be impaired include non-accrual loans, excluding consumer loans, and all TDRs. Regions considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to repay, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and Regions&#8217; evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. For non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans (including TDRs) equal to or greater than $ 2.5 million , the allowance for loan losses is based on a note-level evaluation considering the facts and circumstances specific to each borrower. For these loans, Regions measures the level of impairment based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, the estimated value of the collateral or, if available, the observable market price. Regions generally uses the estimated cash flow method to measure impairment. For commercial and investor real estate accruing TDRs and all non-accruing loans less than $ 2.5 million , the allowance for loan losses is based on a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the note level, where estimated projected cash flows reflect credit losses based on statistical information (including historical default information) derived from loans with similar risk characteristics (e.g., credit quality indicator and product type) using PDs and LGDs as described in the following paragraph. 

Non-Impaired Loans 

For all other commercial and investor real estate loans, the allowance for loan losses is calculated at a pool level based on credit quality indicators and product type. Statistically determined PDs and LGDs are calculated based on historical default and loss information for similar loans. The historical default and loss information is measured over a relevant period for each loan pool. The pool level allowance is calculated using the PD and LGD estimates and is adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of long-term average loss experience compared to previously forecasted losses, external loss data and other risks identified from current economic conditions and credit quality trends. Various one year PD measurements are used in conjunction with life-of-loan LGD measurements to estimate incurred losses. As a result, losses are effectively covered over a two to three year period for loans that are currently in default and those estimated to default within the next twelve months. 

Consumer Components 

For consumer loans, the classes are segmented into pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. For most consumer loan pools, historical losses are the primary factor in establishing the allowance allocated to each pool. The twelve month loss rate is the basis for the allocation and it may be adjusted based on deteriorating trends, portfolio growth, or other factors determined by management to be relevant. 

The allowance for loan losses for the residential first mortgage non-TDR pool is calculated based on a twelve-month historical loss rate segmented based on the following risk characteristics: past due and accrual status and further by geography, property use 

and amortization type for accruing, non-past due loans. The allowance for loan losses for residential first mortgage TDRs is calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis on pools of homogeneous loans. Cash flows are projected using the restructured terms and then discounted at the original note rate. The projected cash flows assume a default rate, which is based on historical performance of residential first mortgage TDRs. The allowance for loan losses for the home equity pool is calculated based on a twelve-month historical loss rate segmented based on the following risk characteristics: lien position, TDR status, geography, non-accrual and past due status, and refreshed FICO scores for accruing, non-past due loans. 

Qualitative Factors 

While quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. Imprecision exists in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and variations between estimates and actual outcomes. Regions adjusts the allowance in consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors which may not be directly measured in the note-level or pooled calculations, including, but not limited to: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Credit quality trends, 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Loss experience in particular portfolios, 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Shifts in credit quality of consumer customers which is not yet reflected in the historical data, 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Volatility associated with large individual credits. 

##TABLE_END Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments 

In order to estimate a reserve for unfunded commitments, Regions uses a process consistent with that used in developing the allowance for loan losses. The reserve is based on an EAD multiplied by a PD multiplied by an LGD. The EAD is estimated based on an analysis of historical funding patterns for defaulted loans in various categories. The PD and LGD align with the statistically-calculated parameters used to calculate the allowance for loan losses for various pools, which are based on credit quality indicators and product type. The methodology applies to commercial and investor real estate credit commitments and standby letters of credit that are not unconditionally cancellable. 

Refer to Note 6 for further discussion regarding the calculation of the allowance for credit losses. 

LEASES 

LESSEES 

Regions' lease portfolio is primarily composed of property leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases with the majority classified as operating leases. Property leases, which primarily include office locations and retail branches, typically have original lease terms ranging from 1 year to 20 years, some of which may also include an option to extend the lease beyond the original lease term. In some circumstances, Regions may also have an option to terminate the lease early with advance notice. Regions includes renewal and termination options within the lease term if deemed reasonably certain of exercise. As most leases do not state an implicit rate, Regions utilizes the incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Regions continues to recognize lease payments as an expense over the lease term as appropriate. The remainder of the lease portfolio is comprised of equipment leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 4 years. 

These leases vary in term and, from time to time, include incentives and/or rent escalations. Examples of incentives include periods of &#8220;free&#8221; rent and leasehold improvement incentives. Regions recognizes incentives and escalations on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction of or increase to rent expense, as applicable, within net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income. 

LESSORS 

Regions engages in both direct financing and sales-type leasing. Regions also has portfolios of leveraged and operating leases. These arrangements provide equipment financing for leased assets, such as vehicles and aircraft. At the commencement date, Regions (lessor) enters into an agreement with the customer (lessee) to lease the underlying equipment for a specified lease term. The lease agreements may provide customers the option to terminate the lease by buying the equipment at fair market value at the time of termination or at the end of the lease term. Regions' equipment finance asset management group performs due diligence procedures on the lease residual and overall equipment values as part of the origination process. Regions performs lease residual value reviews on an ongoing basis. In order to manage the residual value risk inherent in some of its direct financing leases, Regions purchases residual value insurance from an independent third party. 

Sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged leases are recorded within loans and operating leases are recorded within other earning assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The net investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned income. Unearned income is recognized over the terms of the leases to produce a constant effective yield. The net investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease payments (less non-recourse debt payments) and estimated residual values, less unearned income. Income from leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based on the unrecovered equity investment. 

OTHER EARNING ASSETS 

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB stock, FHLB stock, marketable equity securities and operating lease assets. See Note 8 for additional information. 

INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK 

Ownership of FRB and FHLB stock is a requirement for all banks seeking membership into and access to the services provided by these banking systems. These shares are accounted for at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. 

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES 

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income. 

INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING LEASES 

Investments in operating leases represent the assets underlying the related lease contracts and are reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation and net of origination fees and costs. Depreciation on these assets is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the lease term down to an estimated residual value. Regions periodically evaluates its depreciation rate for leased assets based on projected residual values and adjusts depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease if deemed appropriate. Regions also evaluates the current value of the operating lease assets and tests for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. Income from operating lease assets includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, and is recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the scheduled lease term. The accrual of revenue on operating leases is generally discontinued at the time an account is determined to be uncollectible. Operating lease revenue and the depreciation expense on the related operating lease assets are included as components of net interest income and other financing income on the consolidated statements of income. When a leased asset is returned, its remaining value is reclassified from other earning assets to other assets and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell, on Regions' consolidated balance sheet. Impairment of the operating lease asset, as well as residual value gains and losses at the end of the lease term are recorded through other non-interest income. 

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, as applicable. Land is carried at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the improvements (or the terms of the leases, if shorter). Generally, premises and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over 7 - 40 years. Furniture and equipment are generally depreciated or amortized over 3 - 10 years. Premises and equipment are evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Improvements that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized to the carrying value and depreciated. See Note 9 for detail of premises and equipment. 

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Intangible assets include goodwill, which is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses, and other identifiable intangible assets. Other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the following: 1) core deposit intangible assets, which are amounts recorded related to the value of acquired indeterminate maturity deposits, 2) amounts capitalized related to the value of acquired customer relationships, and 3) the DUS license. Core deposit intangibles and certain other identifiable intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis over their expected useful lives. 

The Company&#8217;s goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Regions assesses the following indicators of goodwill impairment for each reporting period: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Recent operating performance, 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Changes in market capitalization, 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors and competition), 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset impairments, and business dispositions), and 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Trends in the banking industry. 

##TABLE_END Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other factors could result in a decline in the implied estimated fair value of goodwill. Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the evidence, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. Step One compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. Step Two of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied estimated fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill for that reporting unit exceeds the implied estimated fair value of that unit&#8217;s goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in other non-interest expense in an amount equal to that excess. 

For purposes of performing the qualitative assessment, Regions evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific factors, and trends in the banking industry to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. 

For purposes of performing Step One of the goodwill impairment test, if applicable, Regions uses both income and market approaches to value its reporting units. The income approach, which is the primary valuation approach, consists of discounting projected long-term future cash flows, which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the respective reporting units. The significant inputs to the income approach include expected future cash flows, the long-term target equity ratios, and the discount rate. 

For purposes of performing Step Two of the goodwill impairment test, if applicable, Regions compares the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In order to determine the implied estimated fair value, a full purchase price allocation would be performed in the same manner as if a business combination had occurred. As part of the Step Two analysis, Regions estimates the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized assets and liabilities. The related valuation methodologies for certain material financial assets and liabilities are discussed in the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section below. 

Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationships and other acquired customer relationships, are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances that could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could include loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit card or other types of acquired customer accounts and/or balances, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent other identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, impairment losses are recorded in other non-interest expense and reduce the carrying amount of the asset. 

Refer to Note 10 for further detail and discussion of the results of the goodwill and other identifiable intangibles impairment tests. 

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 

Regions accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when control over the transferred assets is surrendered. Control is generally considered to have been surrendered when 1) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, 2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a trivial benefit to the Company, and 3) the Company does not maintain the obligation or unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets. If these sale criteria are met, the transferred assets are removed from the Company&#8217;s balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If not met, the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing, and the assets remain on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability, and gain or loss on sale is deferred until the sale criterion are achieved. 

Regions has elected to account for its residential MSRs using the fair value measurement method. Under the fair value measurement method, residential MSRs are measured at estimated fair value each period with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage income. The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of residential mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The valuation method relies on an OAS to consider prepayment risk and equate the asset's discounted cash flows to its market price. See the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value. 

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. Regions' related commercial MSRs are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. Regions periodically evaluates its commercial MSRs for impairment. Regions has a one-third loss share guarantee associated with the majority of the DUS servicing portfolio. The other two-thirds loss share guarantee is retained by Fannie Mae. The estimated fair value of the loss share guarantee is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Refer to Note 7 for further information on servicing of financial assets. 

FORECLOSED PROPERTY AND OTHER REAL ESTATE 

Other real estate and certain other assets acquired in satisfaction of indebtedness (&#8220;foreclosure&#8221;) are carried in other assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the property. At the date of transfer from the loan portfolio, if the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the property&#8217;s estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell, a write-down is recorded against the allowance. Regions allows a period of up to 60 days after the date of transfer to record finalized write-downs as charge-offs against the allowance in order to properly accumulate all related invoices and updated valuation information, if necessary. Subsequent to transfer, Regions obtains valuations from professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers on at least an annual basis. See the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value. Subsequent to transfer and the additional 60 days, any further write-downs are recorded as other non-interest expense. Gain or loss on the sale of foreclosed property and other real estate is included in other non-interest expense. 

From time to time, assets classified as premises and equipment are transferred to held for sale for various reasons. These assets are carried in other assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the asset or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell based upon the property&#8217;s appraised value at the date of transfer. Any adjustments to property held for sale are recorded as other non-interest expense. 

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate asset/liability management strategies and manage other exposures. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, options including interest rate caps and floors, Eurodollar futures, forward rate contracts and forward sale commitments. All derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets or other liabilities, as applicable, at estimated fair value. Regions enters into master netting agreements with counterparties and/or requires collateral to cover exposures. In at least some cases, counterparties post collateral at a zero threshold regardless of credit rating. The majority of interest rate derivatives traded by Regions with dealing counterparties are subject to mandatory clearing through a central clearinghouse. The variation margin payments made for derivatives cleared through a central clearinghouse are legally characterized as settlements of the derivatives. As a result, these positions are reflected as settled with no fair value presented for purposes of the balance sheets and related disclosures. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. 

Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments based upon notional amounts. Interest rate swaps subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Option contracts involve rights to buy or sell financial instruments on a specified date or over a period at a specified price. These rights do not have to be exercised. Some option contracts such as interest rate floors, involve the exchange of cash based on changes in specified indices. Interest rate floors are contracts to hedge interest rate declines based on a notional amount, generally associated with a principal balance at risk. Interest rate floors subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. Regions primarily enters into forward rate contracts on marketable instruments, which expose Regions to market risk associated with changes in the value of the underlying financial instrument, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Eurodollar futures are futures contracts on Eurodollar deposits. Eurodollar futures subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily through a margining process in an exchange, there is minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Forward sale commitments are sales of securities at a specified price at a future date. Forward sale commitments subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in market value, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. 

The Company elects to account for certain derivative financial instruments as accounting hedges which, based on the exposure being hedged, are either fair value or cash flow hedges. 

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of the hedged risk in an asset, liability or firm commitment. Under the fair value hedging model, gains or losses attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the gains and losses attributable to the change in fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in interest income or 

interest expense in the same income statement line item with the hedged item in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. To the extent the changes in fair value of the derivative do not offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is recognized. The corresponding adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded as an adjustment to other assets or other liabilities, as applicable. 

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. For cash flow hedge relationships, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) except for amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item where the earnings effect of the hedged item is presented in the period or periods during which the hedged item impacts earnings. 

The Company formally documents all hedging relationships, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions. The Company performs periodic qualitative and quantitative assessments to determine whether the hedging relationship has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items and whether the relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective in the future. 

If a hedge relationship is de-designated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer exists, or does not meet the definition of a firm commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be recorded as an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other non-interest expense. Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses that were unrecognized and aggregated in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized immediately in other non-interest expense. 

Derivative contracts for which the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting are classified as other assets or liabilities with gains and losses related to the change in fair value recognized in capital markets income or mortgage income, as applicable, in the statements of income during the period. These positions, as well as non-derivative instruments, are used to mitigate economic and accounting volatility related to customer derivative transactions, the mortgage pipeline and the fair value of residential MSRs. 

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. Accordingly, such commitments are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital markets income, as applicable. Regions also has corresponding forward sale commitments related to these interest rate lock commitments, which are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital markets income, as applicable. See the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section below for additional information related to the valuation of interest rate lock commitments. 

Regions enters into various derivative agreements with customers desiring protection from possible future market fluctuations. Regions manages the market risk associated with these derivative agreements. The contracts in this portfolio for which the Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting are marked-to-market through earnings and included in other assets and other liabilities. 

Concurrent with the election to use fair value measurement for residential MSRs, Regions began using various derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs in the statements of income. This effort may involve the use of various derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forwards, futures, swaps and options. These derivatives are carried at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value reported in mortgage income. 

Refer to Note 21 for further discussion and details of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities. 

INCOME TAXES 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the federal and state tax rates to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards. The net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is reported in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. Any effect of a change in federal and state tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company reflects the expected amount of income tax to be paid or refunded during the year as current income tax expense or benefit, as applicable. 

The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is recorded for any deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. 

Income tax benefits generated from uncertain tax positions are accounted for using the recognition and cumulative-probability measurement thresholds. Based on the technical merits, if a tax benefit is not more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon 

examination, the Company records a liability for the recognized income tax benefit. If a tax benefit is more-likely-than-not of being sustained based on the technical merits, the Company utilizes the cumulative probability measurement and records an income tax benefit equivalent to the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest expense, interest income and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within current income tax expense. 

The Company applies the proportional amortization method in accounting for its qualified affordable housing investments. This method recognizes the amortized cost of the investment as a component of income tax expense. 

The deferral method of accounting is used for investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of the related asset. 

Refer to Note 20 for further discussion regarding income taxes. 

TREASURY STOCK AND SHARE REPURCHASES 

The purchase of the Company&#8217;s common stock is recorded at cost. At the date of repurchase, stockholders' equity is reduced by the repurchase price. Upon retirement, or upon purchase for constructive retirement, treasury stock would be reduced by the cost of such stock with the excess of repurchase price over par or stated value recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the Company subsequently reissues treasury shares, treasury stock is reduced by the cost of such stock with differences recorded in additional paid-in capital or retained earnings, as applicable. 

Pursuant to recent share repurchase programs, shares repurchased were immediately retired, and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The Company's policy related to these share repurchases is to reduce its common stock based on the par value of the shares repurchased and to reduce its additional paid-in capital for the excess of the repurchase price over the par value. 

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 

Regions sponsors stock plans which most commonly include restricted stock (i.e., unvested common stock) units, restricted stock awards, performance stock units and stock options. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the fair value recognition provisions whereby compensation cost is measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the grant date and is recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for service-based awards. The fair value of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or performance stock units is determined based on the closing price of Regions common stock on the date of grant. Historical data is also used to estimate future employee attrition, which is considered in calculating estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted when actual forfeitures differ from estimates, resulting in the recognition of compensation cost only for awards that vest. The effect of a change in estimated forfeitures is recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment that is included in salaries and employee benefits expense in the period of the change in estimate. The fair value of stock options where vesting is based on service is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and related assumptions. As compensation cost is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time the share-based awards are exercised, cancelled, have expired, or restrictions are released, the Company may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense depending on the market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

See Note 17 for further discussion and details of share-based payments. 

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

Regions uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flows during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension plan assets. At a minimum, amortization of the net gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining service period of active participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. Regions records the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in salaries and employee benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income. The other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. Regions uses a third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of active participating employees. This period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement mortality, and other applicable employee demographics. 

See Note 18 for further discussion and details of employee benefit plans. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

Interest Income 

The largest source of revenue for Regions is interest income. Interest income is recognized using the interest method driven by nondiscretionary formulas based on written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund fees and other service charges. Non-sufficient fund fees are earned when a depositor presents an item for payment in excess of available funds, and Regions, at its discretion, provides the necessary funds to complete the transaction. 

Regions generates other service charges by providing depositors proper safeguard and remittance of funds as well as by providing optional services for depositors, such as check imaging or treasury management, that are performed upon the depositor&#8217;s request. Charges for the proper safeguard and remittance of funds are recognized monthly, as the customer retains funds in the account. Regions recognizes revenue for other optional services when the customer uses the selected service to execute a transaction (e.g., execute an ACH wire). 

Card and ATM Fees 

Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card, debit card, and ATM related revenue. The majority of the fees are card interchange where Regions earns a fee for remitting cardholder funds (or extends credit) via a third party network to merchants. Regions satisfies performance obligations for each transaction when the card is used and the funds are remitted. The network establishes interchange fees that the merchant remits to Regions for each transaction, and Regions incurs costs from the network for facilitating the interchange with the merchant. Due to its inability to establish prices and direct activities of the related processing network&#8217;s service, Regions is deemed the agent in this arrangement and records interchange revenues net of related costs. Regions also pays consideration to certain commercial card holders based on interchange fees and contractual volume. These costs are recognized as a reduction to interchange income. 

Card and ATM fees also include ATM fee income generated from allowing a Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a non-Regions ATM and from allowing a non-Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a Regions ATM. Regions satisfies performance obligations for each transaction when the withdrawal is processed. Regions does not direct activities of the related processing network&#8217;s service and recognizes revenue on a net basis as the agent in each transaction. 

Investment Management and Trust Fee Income 

Investment management and trust fee income represents revenue generated from asset management services provided to individuals, businesses, and institutions. Regions has a fiduciary responsibility to the beneficiary of the trust to perform agreed upon services which can include investing the assets, periodic reporting to the beneficiaries, and providing tax information regarding the trust. In exchange for these trust and custodial services, Regions collects fee income from beneficiaries as contractually determined via fee schedules. Regions&#8217; performance obligations to customers are primarily satisfied over time as the services are performed and provided to the customer. 

Mortgage Income 

Mortgage income and related fees are recognized when earned as Regions services mortgage loans for others. Mortgage income also includes gains or losses on Regions&#8217; sales of mortgage loans to other financial institutions or government agencies which are recognized as each sales transaction occurs. 

Capital Markets Income 

Regions generates capital markets fee revenue through capital raising activities which include revenue streams such as securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. For those revenue streams, revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time which coincides with the satisfaction of a single performance obligation, typically the transaction closing. 

Securities underwriting and placement fees involve the issuing and distribution of securities for an underwriting fee from customers. The underwriting fee is a single performance obligation which is satisfied at the time that the transaction is closed, and the amount of the fee is either a fixed or variable percentage based on the deal value which is determinable at the time of deal closing. 

Regions generates revenue from affordable housing investments through the syndication of investment funds to third parties. Regions transfers the primary benefits of the investment to the customer and recognizes syndication revenue on the closing date of the transaction. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

Bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Regions recognizes revenue each period in the amount of the appreciation of the cash surrender value of the insurance policies. Revenue from the proceeds of insurance benefits is recognized at the time a claim is confirmed. 

Commercial Credit Fee Income 

Commercial credit fee income includes letters of credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees. Regions recognizes revenue for letters of credit fees over time. Regions recognizes revenue for unused commercial commitment fees on the date that the commitment expires. 

Investment Services Fee Income 

Investment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. Through the use of third party carriers, Regions provides its customers with access to investment products that meet customers&#8217; financial needs and investment objectives. Upon selection of an investment product, the customer enters into a policy with the carrier. Regions&#8217; performance obligation is satisfied by fulfilling its responsibility to place customers in investment vehicles for which Regions earns commissions from the carrier based on agreed-upon fee percentages. In addition, Regions has a contractual relationship with a third party broker dealer to provide full service brokerage and investment advisory activities. As the principal in the arrangement, Regions recognizes the investment services commissions on a gross basis. 

Insurance Proceeds 

Insurance proceeds represent settlements from previously disclosed lawsuits. Revenue from insurance proceeds is recognized when the settlement proceeds are received. 

Securities Gains (Losses), Net 

Net securities gains or losses result from Regions&#8217; asset/liability management process. Gains or losses on the sale of securities are recognized as each sales transaction occurs with the cost of securities sold based on the specific identification method. 

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets 

Regions holds assets for certain employee benefit assets, both defined and other. Those assets are recorded at estimated fair value and the market value variations are recognized each period. 

Other Miscellaneous Income 

Other miscellaneous income represents a variety of revenue streams, including check order fees, wire transfer fees and other unusual gains, if any. For check order fees, Regions generates revenue by serving as the agent in connecting the customer to a third party check provider. For wire transfer fees, Regions generates revenue by providing wire transfer services to its depositors. In both instances Regions recognizes revenue at the time the service is provided. 

PER SHARE AMOUNTS 

Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the effect of outstanding stock options, restricted and performance stock awards if dilutive. Refer to Note 16 for additional information . 

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value guidance establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price). A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Required disclosures include stratification of balance sheet amounts measured at fair value based on inputs the Company uses to derive fair value measurements. These strata include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume), 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market, and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company&#8217;s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. 

##TABLE_END ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS 

Debt securities available for sale, certain mortgage loans held for sale, marketable equity securities, residential MSRs, derivative assets and derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Below is a description of valuation methodologies for these assets and liabilities. 

Debt securities available for sale consist of U.S. Treasuries, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities (including agency securities), and other debt securities. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

U.S. Treasuries are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges. Pricing received for U.S. Treasuries from third-party services is based on a market approach using dealer quotes from multiple active market makers and real-time trading systems. These valuations are Level 1 measurements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Mortgage-backed securities are valued primarily using data from third-party pricing services for similar securities as applicable. Pricing from these third-party services is generally based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark securities, TBA prices, issuer spreads, bids and offers, monthly payment information, and collateral performance, as applicable. These valuations are Level 2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not available, the Company develops valuations based on assumptions that are not readily observable in the market place; these valuations are Level 3 measurements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Obligations of states and political subdivisions are generally based on data from third-party pricing services. The valuations are based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, MSRB reported trades, material event notices and new issue data. These valuations are Level 2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not available, the Company develops valuations based on assumptions that are not readily observable in the market place; these valuations are Level 3 measurements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Other debt securities are valued based on Level 1, 2 and 3 measurements, depending on pricing methodology selected and are valued primarily using data from third-party pricing services. Pricing from these third-party services is generally based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers, and TRACE reported trades. 

##TABLE_END The majority of Regions' debt securities available for sale are valued using third-party pricing services. To validate pricing related to liquid investment securities, which represent the vast majority of the available for sale portfolio (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), Regions compares price changes received from the third-party pricing service to overall changes in market factors in order to validate the pricing received. To validate pricing received on less liquid investment securities in the available for sale portfolio, Regions receives pricing from third-party brokers-dealers on a sample of securities that are then compared to the pricing received. The pricing service uses standard observable inputs when available, for example: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, and bids and offers, among others. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. It is not customary for Regions to adjust the pricing received for the available for sale portfolio. In the event that prices are adjusted, Regions classifies the measurement as a Level 3 measurement. 

Mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential first mortgage loans and commercial mortgages held for sale. Regions has elected to measure certain residential and commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value by applying the fair value option (see additional discussion under the &#8220;Fair Value Option&#8221; section in Note 22 ). The residential first mortgage loans held for sale are valued based on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include servicing value and market conditions, a Level 2 measurement. The commercial mortgage loans held for sale are valued based on traded market prices for comparable commercial mortgage-backed securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted for movements of interest rates and credit spreads, a Level 3 measurement due to the unobservable inputs included in the credit spreads for bonds in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. 

Marketable equity securities, which primarily consist of assets held for certain employee benefits and money market funds, are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges; these valuations are Level 1 measurements. 

Residential mortgage servicing rights are valued using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, a Level 3 measurement. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated at least quarterly by values received from independent third parties. See Note 7 for information regarding the servicing of financial assets and additional details regarding the assumptions relevant to this valuation. 

Derivative assets and liabilities, which primarily consist of interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity contracts that include forwards, futures, options and swaps, are included in other assets and other liabilities (as applicable) on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest rate swaps are predominantly traded in over-the-counter markets and, as such, values are determined using widely accepted discounted cash flow models, which are Level 2 measurements. These discounted cash flow models use projections of future cash payments/receipts that are discounted at an appropriate index rate. Regions utilizes OIS curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of interest rate and commodity derivatives. The projected future cash flows are sourced from an assumed yield curve, which is consistent with industry standards and conventions. These valuations are adjusted for the unsecured credit risk at the reporting date, which considers collateral posted and the impact of master netting agreements. For options and futures contracts traded in over-the-counter markets, values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models based on market rates and volatilities, which are Level 2 measurements. Interest rate lock commitments on loans intended 

for sale and risk participations categorized as credit derivatives are valued using option pricing models that incorporate significant unobservable inputs, and therefore are Level 3 measurements. 

ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS 

From time to time, certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically are a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a write-down occurring during the period. For example, if the fair value of an asset in these categories falls below its cost basis, it is considered to be at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment. In periods where there is no adjustment, the asset is generally not considered to be at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

Foreclosed property and other real estate is carried in other assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value less estimated costs to sell the property. The fair value for foreclosed property that is based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed sale prices is classified as a Level 2 measurement. If no formally committed sale price is available, Regions also obtains valuations from professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers. Updated valuations are obtained on at least an annual basis. Foreclosed property exceeding established dollar thresholds is valued based on appraisals. Appraisals are performed by third-parties with appropriate professional certifications and conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. Regions&#8217; policies related to appraisals conform to regulations established by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and other regulatory guidance. Professional valuations are considered Level 2 measurements because they are based largely on observable inputs. Regions has a centralized appraisal review function that is responsible for reviewing appraisals for compliance with banking regulations and guidelines as well as appraisal standards. Based on these reviews, Regions may make adjustments to the market value conclusions determined in the appraisals of real estate (either as other real estate or loans held for sale) when the appraisal review function determines that the valuation is based on inappropriate assumptions or where the conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the market data presented in the appraisal. Adjustments to the market value conclusions are discussed with the professional valuation experts and/or third-party appraisers; the magnitude of the adjustments that are not mutually agreed upon is insignificant. Adjustments, if made, must be based on sufficient information available to support an alternate opinion of market value. An estimated standard discount factor, which is updated at least annually, is applied to the appraisal amount for certain commercial and investor real estate properties when the recorded investment in the loan is transferred into foreclosed property. Internally adjusted valuations are considered Level 3 measurements as management uses assumptions that may not be observable in the market. These non-recurring fair value measurements are typically recorded on the date an updated offered quote, appraisal, or third-party valuation is received. 

Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are adjusted prospectively to estimated fair value when an observable price transaction for a same or similar investment with the same issuer occurs; these valuations are Level 3 measurements. 

Loans held for sale for which the fair value option has not been elected are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair values for commercial loans held for sale are based on Company-specific data not observable in the market. These valuations are Level 3 measurements. 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that are not disclosed above: 

Cash and cash equivalents : The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows approximate the estimated fair values. Because these amounts generally relate to either currency or highly liquid assets, these are considered Level 1 valuations. 

Debt securities held to maturity : The fair values of debt securities held to maturity are estimated in the same manner as the corresponding debt securities available for sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Loans, (excluding capital leases), net of unearned income and allowance for loan losses : A discounted cash flow method under the income approach is utilized to estimate the fair value of the loan portfolio. The discounted cash flow method relies upon assumptions about the amount and timing of scheduled principal and interest payments, principal prepayments, and current market rates. The loan portfolio is aggregated into categories based on loan type and credit quality. For each loan category, weighted average statistics, such as coupon rate, age, and remaining term are calculated. These are Level 3 valuations. 

Other earning assets (excluding equity investments and operating leases) : The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the estimated fair values. While these instruments are not actively traded in the market, the majority of the inputs required to value them are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources. Accordingly, these are Level 2 valuations. 

Deposits : The fair value of non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certain other time deposit accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., the 

carrying amount). Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on market spreads to benchmark rates. These are Level 2 valuations. 

Short-term and long-term borrowings : The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the estimated fair values, and are considered Level 2 measurements as similar instruments are traded in active markets. The fair values of certain long-term borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of identical instruments in active markets and are considered Level 1 measurements. The fair values of certain long term borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of identical instruments in non-active markets and are considered Level 2 valuations. Otherwise, valuations are based on non-binding broker quotes and are considered Level 3 valuations. 

Loan commitments and letters of credit : The estimated fair values for these off-balance sheet instruments are based on probabilities of funding to project future loan fundings, which are discounted using the loan methodology described above. The premiums/discounts are adjusted for the time value of money over the average remaining life of the commitments and the opportunity cost associated with regulatory requirements. Because the probabilities of funding and loan valuations are not observable in the market and are considered Company specific inputs, these are Level 3 valuations. 

See Note 22 for additional information related to fair value measurements . 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES 

The following table provides a brief description of accounting standards adopted in 2019 and those that could have a material impact to Regions&#8217; consolidated financial statements upon adoption in the future. 

##TABLE_START Standard 

Description 

Required Date of Adoption 

Effect on Regions' financial statements or other significant matters 

Standards Adopted (or partially adopted) in 2019 

ASU 2016-02, Leases ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842 ASU 2018-10, Narrow Amendments to Topic 842 ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to Topic 842 ASU 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements 

This ASU creates ASC Topic 842, Leases, and supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The new guidance requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability equal to the present value of future rental payments on their balance sheets for all leases with a term greater than one year. There are not significant changes to lessor accounting; however, there were certain improvements made to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance expands both quantitative and qualitative required disclosures. 

January 1, 2019 

Regions adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method, which allowed for a modified retrospective method of adoption with an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings without restating comparable periods. Regions elected the relief package of practical expedients for which there is no requirement to reassess existence of leases, their classification, and initial direct costs. Regions also applied the exemption for short-term leases with a term of less than one year, whereby Regions does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet but instead recognizes lease payments as an expense over the lease term as appropriate. For property leases, Regions did not elect the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. The standard resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while accounting for finance leases remains largely unchanged. Adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $451 million as of January 1, 2019. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most leases do not state an implicit rate, Regions utilizes the incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

ASU 2017-08, Receivables- Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs 

This ASU amends Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, to shorten the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium to the earliest call date. Current guidance generally requires entities to amortize a premium as a yield adjustment over the contractual life of the instrument. Shortening the amortization period is generally expected to more closely align the recognition of interest income with expectations incorporated into the pricing of the underlying securities. The amendments do not affect the accounting treatment of discounts. This ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.

ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements 

The FASB issued this ASU to clarify, improve, and correct errors in the Codification. The ASU covers nine amendments, which affect a wide variety of Topics including business combinations, debt, derivatives and hedging, and defined contribution pension plans. Some amendments do not require transition guidance and are effective upon issuance, while others will be applicable for Regions starting in 2019. 

January 1, 2019 

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact. 

ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging 

This ASU amends Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to expand the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates permitted in applying hedge accounting. The amendments permit all entities that elect to apply hedge accounting to benchmark interest rate hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to use the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate in addition to the four eligible U.S. benchmark interest rates. The amendments should be applied prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after the date of adoption.

ASU 2019-11, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 

This ASU amends Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses to replace the current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The amendments require entities to consider all available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect the portion of the amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to collect. The amendments also eliminate the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required upon adoption. While the CECL model does not apply to available for sale debt securities, the ASU does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit losses for available for sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized cost of the securities by direct write-offs. The ASU should be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Entities that have loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 at the time of adoption should prospectively apply the guidance in this amendment for purchase credit deteriorated assets. 

January 1, 2020 

Regions expects that the allowance for credit losses of $914 million will increase by approximately $500 million upon adoption. This estimate is based on loan exposure balances and Regions&#8217; internally developed macroeconomic forecast as of January 1, 2020, which provides for a relatively stable macroeconomic environment over a two year reasonable and supportable forecast period, as compared to the December 31, 2019 macroeconomic environment. After the forecast period, the Company reverts to longer term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments, to estimate losses over the remaining life. 

The estimated increase in the allowance at adoption is primarily the result of significant increases within the consumer portfolio segment, specifically residential first mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines, and indirect-other consumer. The impact to the residential first mortgage and home equity classes is mainly driven by their longer time to maturity. Additionally, a significant portion of the indirect-other consumer class is unsecured lending through third parties which yield higher loss rates. Under CECL, these higher loss rates compounded over a life of loan estimate result in a significantly larger allowance estimate. 

A suite of controls including governance, data, forecast and model controls is in place to support the disclosed estimate. 

The impact will be reflected as a reduction of approximately $375 million to retained earnings and an increase of approximately $125 million to deferred tax assets. Federal banking regulatory agencies have provided relief, which Regions intends to adopt, for an initial capital decrease at adoption by allowing the impact to be phased-in, such that 25% of the transitional amounts are phased-in with the impact of adoption completely recognized by the beginning of the fourth year. The adoption of CECL in 2020 may also impact Regions' ongoing earnings, perhaps materially, due in part to changes in loan portfolio composition, changes in credit metrics, and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. 

Regions expects no material allowance on available for sale or held to maturity securities. Most of the held to maturity portfolio consists of agency-backed securities that inherently have an immaterial risk of loss. 

ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment 

This ASU amends Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.

Regions adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2020 with no material impact. 

ASU 2018-15, Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement 

This ASU amends Topic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software, regarding a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is hosted by the vendor, i.e. a service contract. Customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The amendments also prescribe the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and require additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. 

January 1, 2020 

Regions adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2020 with no material impact. 

ASU 2018-17, Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities

This ASU amends Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, by providing clarification on ASU 2017-12, which the Company previously adopted. The amendment provides clarity on the term used to measure the change in fair value on a partial term hedge of interest rate risk. The amendment also provides additional guidance on the amortization of the basis adjustment on partial term hedges. This ASU also amends Topic 825, Financial Instruments, by providing clarification on ASU 2016-01, which the Company previously adopted. The amendment clarifies that an entity must remeasure a security without a readily determinable fair value at fair value in accordance with Topic 820 when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment.

ASU 2019-08 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 

The amendments in this Update require that an entity measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer by applying the guidance in Topic 718. The amount recorded as a reduction of the transaction price is required to be measured on the basis of the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment award measured in accordance with Topic 718. The grant date is the date at which a grantor (supplier) and grantee (customer) reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award. The classification and subsequent measurement of the award are subject to the guidance in Topic 718 unless the share-based payment award is subsequently modified and the grantee is no longer a customer.

NOTE 2. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

Regions is involved in various entities that are considered to be VIEs, as defined by authoritative accounting literature. Generally, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal structure that either does not have equity investors with substantive voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. The following discusses the VIEs in which Regions has a significant interest. 

AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS 

Regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects, which are funded through a combination of debt and equity. These partnerships meet the definition of a VIE. Regions uses the proportional amortization method to account for these investments. Due to the nature of the management activities of the general partner, Regions is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships. See Note 1 for additional details. Additionally, Regions has loans or letters of credit commitments with certain limited partnerships. The funded portion of the loans and letters of credit are classified as commercial and industrial loans or investor real estate loans as applicable in Note 5 . 

A summary of Regions&#8217; affordable housing tax credit investments and related loans and letters of credit, representing Regions&#8217; maximum exposure to loss as of December 31 is as follows: &#160;

##TABLE_END

In addition to the investments discussed above, Regions also syndicates affordable housing investments. In these syndication transactions, Regions creates affordable housing funds in which a subsidiary is the general partner or managing member and sells limited partnership interests to third parties. Regions' general partner or managing member interest represents an insignificant interest in the affordable housing fund. The affordable housing funds meet the definition of a VIE. As Regions is not the primary beneficiary and does not have a significant interest, these investments are not consolidated. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the value of Regions&#8217; general partnership interest in affordable housing investments was immaterial. 

OTHER INVESTMENTS 

Other investments determined to be VIEs include investments in CRA projects, SBICs, and other miscellaneous investments. A summary of Regions' equity method investments representing Regions' maximum exposure to loss as of December 31 is as follows:

##TABLE_END

The number of individual debt positions in an unrealized loss position in the tables above decreased from 1,379 at December 31, 2018 to 500 at December 31, 2019 . The decrease in the number of securities and the total amount of gross unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in market interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no individual unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented an OTTI as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 

As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating OTTI, management did identify a limited number of positions where an OTTI was believed to exist during 2019 . 

Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of debt securities available for sale from continuing operations are shown in the table below. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Loans are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan costs of $ 11 million and $( 4 ) million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

##TABLE_END During 2019 and 2018 , Regions purchased approximately $ 1.5 billion and $ 503 million in indirect-other consumer and commercial and industrial loans from third parties, respectively. 

In January 2019, Regions decided to discontinue its indirect auto lending business due to margin compression impacting overall returns on the portfolio. Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of 2019 and completed any in-process indirect auto loan closings by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will remain in the direct auto lending business. 

At December 31, 2019 , $ 21.6 billion in securities and net eligible loans held by Regions were pledged to secure current and potential borrowings from the FHLB. At December 31, 2019 , an additional $ 22.7 billion in net eligible loans held by Regions were pledged to the FRB for potential borrowings. 

See Note 14 for details regarding Regions&#8217; investment in sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged leases included within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. 

NOTE 6. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on a quarterly basis. The methodology is described in Note 1. 

ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The following tables present analyses of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . The total allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio ending balances are disaggregated to detail the amounts derived through individual evaluation and collective evaluation for impairment. The allowance for loan losses related to individually evaluated loans is attributable to reserves for non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans and all TDRs. The allowance for loan losses and the loan portfolio ending balances related to collectively evaluated loans is attributable to the remainder of the portfolio.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS 

The following describe the risk characteristics relevant to each of the portfolio segments. 

Commercial &#8212;The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from customers&#8217; business operations, and the sensitivity to market fluctuations in commodity prices. 

Investor Real Estate &#8212;Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the valuation of real estate. 

Consumer &#8212;The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage, home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower&#8217;s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. Regions decided in January 2019 to discontinue its indirect auto lending business. Indirect-other consumer lending includes other lending through third parties. Consumer credit card lending includes Regions branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer loans include other revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures. 

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS 

The following tables present credit quality indicators for the loan portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

Commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are detailed by categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Pass&#8212;includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Special Mention&#8212;includes obligations that have potential weakness that may, if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the Company&#8217;s position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an adverse effect on debt service ability; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Substandard Accrual&#8212;includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not corrected; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Non-accrual&#8212;includes obligations where management has determined that full payment of principal and interest is in doubt. 

##TABLE_END Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to as &#8220;classified.&#8221; Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to as &#8220;criticized and classified.&#8221; Classes in the consumer portfolio segment are disaggregated by accrual status.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS 

Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order to facilitate a workout strategy. Typical modifications include accommodations, such as renewals and forbearances. The majority of Regions&#8217; commercial and investor real estate TDRs are the result of renewals of classified loans at an interest rate that is not considered to be a market interest rate. For smaller dollar commercial loans, Regions may periodically grant interest rate and other term concessions, similar to those under the consumer program described below. 

Regions works to meet the individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP. Regions designed the program to allow for customer-tailored modifications with the goal of keeping customers in their homes and avoiding foreclosure where possible. Modification may be offered to any borrower experiencing financial hardship regardless of the borrower&#8217;s payment status. Consumer TDRs primarily involve an interest rate concession, however under the CAP, Regions may also offer a short-term deferral, a term extension, a new loan product, or a combination of these options. For loans restructured under the CAP, Regions expects to collect the original contractually due principal. The gross original contractual interest may be collectible, depending on the terms modified. All CAP modifications are considered TDRs regardless of the term because they are concessionary in nature and because the customer documents a financial hardship in order to participate. 

As noted above, the majority of Regions&#8217; TDRs are results of interest rate concessions and not a forgiveness of principal. Accordingly, the financial impact of the modifications is best illustrated by the impact to the allowance calculation at the loan or pool level, as a result of the loans being considered impaired due to their TDR status. Regions most often does not record a charge-off at the modification date. 

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs. Loans first reported as TDRs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled approximately $ 239 million and $ 374 million , respectively.

NOTE 7. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES 

The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. 

The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value measurement method for the years ended December 31 : &#160;

"Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. 

##TABLE_END In 2017, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $ 2.7 billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $ 30 million . 

In 2018, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $ 6.1 billion in residential mortgage loans for approximately $ 77 million . Approximately $ 7 million of the purchase price was paid in 2019. 

In 2019, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately $ 409 million in residential mortgage loans for approximately $ 4 million . Additionally, Regions purchased rights to service residential mortgage loans on a flow basis for approximately $ 13 million in 2019. The Company sold $ 167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans and as part of the transaction kept the rights to service the loans, which resulted in the retained residential MSR of approximately $ 2 million . 

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the valuation&#8217;s sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs (excluding related derivative instruments) as of December 31 are as follows: &#160;

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above. 

The following table presents servicing related fees, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans for the years ended December 31 :

##TABLE_END

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are breached. 

Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses based on historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends. Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. 

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES 

Regions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee associated with the loans. See Note 1 for additional information. Also see Note 24 for additional information related to the guarantee. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the DUS servicing portfolio was approximately $ 3.9 billion and $ 3.6 billion , respectively. The related commercial MSRs were approximately $ 59 million and $ 56 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimated fair value of the commercial MSRs was approximately $ 64 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 59 million at December 31, 2018. 

NOTE 8. OTHER EARNING ASSETS 

Other earning assets consist primarily of investments in FRB stock, FHLB stock, marketable equity securities, and operating lease assets. See Note 14 for information related to operating leases.

Regions assessed the indicators of goodwill impairment for all three reporting units as part of its annual impairment test, as of October 1, 2019 , and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific factors and trends in the banking industry. The results of the qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of the test date; therefore, the quantitative goodwill impairment tests were deemed unnecessary.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019, Regions had three issuances and Regions Bank had one issuance of subordinated notes totaling $ 554 million and $ 495 million, respectively, with stated interest rates ranging from 6.45 % to 7.75 % . All issuances of these notes are, by definition, subordinated and subject in right of payment of both principal and interest to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which is generally defined as all indebtedness and other obligations of the Company to its creditors, except subordinated indebtedness. Payment of the principal of the notes may be accelerated only in the case of certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or reorganization of the Company. The subordinated notes described above qualify as Tier 2 capital under Federal Reserve guidelines, subject to diminishing credit as the respective maturity dates approach and subject to certain transition provisions. None of the subordinated notes are redeemable prior to maturity, unless there is an occurrence of a qualifying capital event. 

During 2019 , Regions issued $ 500 million of senior notes through a reopening of the Company's 3.80 % senior notes due August 2023 and simultaneously entered into an interest rate swap, effectively converting the notes to floating rate notes at 1 month LIBOR. On December 6, 2019, Regions received tenders for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 740 million of its outstanding 3.20% senior notes due 2021, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the tender offer made for any and all of these outstanding senior notes. The pre-tax loss on early extinguishment related to the execution of this offer amounted to $ 16 million. 

FHLB advances at December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.9 percent , 2.6 percent , and 1.4 percent , respectively, with remaining maturities as of December 31, 2019 ranging from less than one year to eight years and a weighted-average of 0.7 years. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent upon the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions has pledged certain loans as collateral for the FHLB advances outstanding. See Note 5 for loans pledged to the FHLB at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Additionally, membership in the FHLB requires an institution to hold FHLB stock. See Note 8 for the amount of FHLB stock held at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Regions&#8217; total borrowing capacity with the FHLB (including outstanding advances) as of December 31, 2019 , based on assets available for collateral at that date, was approximately $ 17.5 billion . 

Regions uses derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risk by converting a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a variable-rate. The effective rate adjustments related to these hedges are included in interest expense on long-term borrowings. The weighted-average interest rate on total long-term debt, including the effect of derivative instruments, was 3.4 percent , 3.2 percent , and 3.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 21 . 

The aggregate amount of contractual maturities of all long-term debt in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

On February 22, 2019, Regions filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC. This shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. The registration statement will expire in February 2022. 

Regions Bank may issue bank notes from time to time, either as part of a bank note program or as stand-alone issuances. Notes issued by Regions Bank may be senior or subordinated notes. Notes issued by Regions Bank are not deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC. 

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some securities. 

NOTE 13. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company&#8217;s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Banking regulations identify five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Regions and Regions Bank exceeded all current regulatory requirements, and were classified as "well-capitalized." Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2019 that would change this designation. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require institutions to maintain minimum ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (the "Leverage" ratio). 

The following tables summarize the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements:

##TABLE_END

&#160;_________ 

(1) The 2019 Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and Leverage capital ratios are estimated. 

Substantially all net assets are owned by subsidiaries. The primary source of operating cash available to Regions is provided by dividends from subsidiaries. Statutory limits are placed on the amount of dividends the subsidiary bank can pay without prior regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities require the maintenance of minimum capital-to-asset ratios at banking subsidiaries. Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation H, Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank&#8217;s net income for that year and (b) its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock. Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a dividend to Regions in excess of 90 percent of its net earnings until the bank&#8217;s surplus is equal to at least 20 percent of capital. Regions Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama Superintendent of Banking prior to paying a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (a) Regions Bank&#8217;s net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The statute defines net earnings as &#8220;the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred 

stock, if any, and all federal, state and local taxes.&#8221; In addition to dividend restrictions, Federal statutes also prohibit unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the parent company. 

In addition, Regions must adhere to various HUD regulatory guidelines including required minimum capital to maintain their HUD approved status. Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification. As of December 31, 2019 , Regions was in compliance with HUD guidelines. Regions is also subject to various capital requirements by secondary market investors. 

NOTE 14. LEASES 

LESSEE 

As of December 31, 2019 , assets and liabilities recorded under operating leases for properties were $ 443 million and $ 514 million, respectively. The difference between the asset and liability balance is largely the result of lease liabilities that existed prior to the January 1, 2019 adoption of the new accounting guidance for leases. The asset is recorded within other assets, and the lease liability is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Lease expense, which is operating lease costs recorded within net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income, was $ 81 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Other information related to operating leases is as follows:

(1) Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to (i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024, 6.375 % , and (ii) for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR plus 3.536 % . 

(2) Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to (i) for each period beginning prior to August 15, 2029, 5.700 % , and (ii) for each period beginning on or after August 15, 2029, three-month LIBOR plus 3.148 % . 

For each preferred stock issuance listed above, Regions issued depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the Company's preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $ 1,000.00 per share of preferred stock (equivalent to $ 25.00 per depositary share). Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption is solely at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part, after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series A preferred stock or at any time following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series B and Series C preferred stock. 

The Board of Directors declared $ 64 million in cash dividends on both Series A and Series B preferred stock, during both 2019 and 2018. In 2019, the Board of Directors declared $ 15 million in cash dividends on Series C Preferred Stock. Therefore, a total of $ 79 million in cash dividends on total preferred stock was declared in 2019 compared to the total of $ 64 million cash dividends on total preferred stock declared in 2018. 

In the event Series A, Series B, or Series C preferred shares are redeemed at the liquidation amounts, $ 113 million , $ 67 million , or $ 10 million excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will be recognized, respectively. Approximately $ 100 million of Series A preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately $ 13 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Approximately $ 52 million of Series B preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately $ 15 million of related issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Approximately $ 10 million of Series C issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. 

COMMON STOCK 

Regions was not required to participate in the 2019 CCAR; however, as required, the Company did submit its planned capital actions to the Federal Reserve for the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. As part of the Company's capital plan, the Board authorized a new $ 1.370 billion common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. 

As of December 31, 2019, Regions had repurchased approximately 47.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 721.5 million under this plan. All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and, therefore will not be included in treasury stock. 

Prior to the new common stock repurchase plan, Regions had authorization to repurchase $ 2.031 billion in common shares. As of June 30, 2019, Regions had repurchased approximately 115.38 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $ 2.031 billion under this plan. 

Regions declared $ 0.59 per share in cash dividends for 2019, $ 0.46 for 2018, and $ 0.315 for 2017.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Certain per share amounts may not appear to reconcile due to rounding. 

##TABLE_END The effect from the assumed exercise of 7 million , 6 million and 14 million in stock options, restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, was not included in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share. 

NOTE 17. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 

Regions administers long-term incentive compensation plans that permit the granting of incentive awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, performance awards and stock appreciation rights. While Regions has the ability to issue stock appreciation rights, none have been issued to date. The terms of all awards issued under these plans are determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board; however, no awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary from the date the plans were initially approved by stockholders. Incentive awards usually vest based on employee service, generally within 3 years from the date of the grant. The contractual lives of options granted under these plans are typically ten years from the date of the grant. 

On April 23, 2015, the stockholders of the Company approved the Regions Financial Corporation 2015 LTIP, which permits the Company to grant to employees and directors various forms of incentive compensation. These forms of incentive compensation are similar to the types of compensation approved in prior plans. The 2015 LTIP authorizes 60 million common share equivalents available for grant, where grants of options and grants of full value awards (e.g., shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) count as one share equivalent. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board, grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units accrue dividends, or their notional equivalent, as they are declared by the Board, and are paid upon vesting of the award. Upon adoption of the 2015 LTIP, Regions closed the prior long-term incentive plan to new grants, and, accordingly, prospective grants must be made under the 2015 LTIP or a successor plan. All existing grants under prior long-term incentive plans are unaffected by adoption of the 2015 LTIP. The number of remaining share equivalents available for future issuance under the 2015 LTIP was approximately 39 million at December 31, 2019 . 

Grants of performance-based restricted stock typically have a three-year performance period, and shares vest within three years after the grant date. Restricted stock units typically have a vesting period of three years. Grantees of restricted stock awards or units must either remain employed with the Company for certain periods from the date of grant in order for shares to be released or issued or retire after meeting the standards of a retiree, at which time shares would be issued and released. The terms of these plans generally stipulate that the exercise price of options may not be less than the fair market value of Regions' common stock at the date the options are granted. Regions issues new shares from authorized reserves upon exercise. 

The following table summarizes the elements of compensation cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31 :

The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $ 8 million for 2019 , $ 10 million for 2018 , and $ 13 million for 2017 . Cash received from options exercised was $ 5 million, $ 11 million, and $ 8 million in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised totaled $ 2 million for 2019 , $ 4 million for 2018 , and $ 3 million for 2017 . 

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS 

During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , Regions made restricted stock grants that vest upon satisfaction of service conditions and restricted stock award and performance stock award grants that vest based upon service conditions and performance conditions. Incremental shares earned above the performance target associated with previous performance stock awards are included when and if performance targets are achieved. Dividend payments during the vesting period are deferred to the end of the vesting term. The fair value of these restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance stock units was estimated based upon the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. The valuation was not adjusted for the deferral of dividends. 

Activity related to restricted stock awards and performance stock awards for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is summarized as follows:

NOTE 18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 

Regions' defined benefit pension plans cover only certain employees as the pension plans are closed to new entrants. Benefits under the pension plans are based on years of service and the employee&#8217;s highest five consecutive years of compensation during the last ten years of employment. Regions&#8217; funding policy is to contribute annually at least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. 

The Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a non-qualified pension plan that provides certain senior executive officers defined benefits in relation to their compensation. Actuarially determined pension expense is charged to current operations using the projected unit credit method. All defined benefit plans are referred to as &#8220;the plans&#8221; throughout the remainder of this footnote. 

The following table sets forth the plans&#8217; change in benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status, using a December 31 measurement date, and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31 :

##TABLE_END

The accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified plans was $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Total plan assets exceeded the corresponding accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified plans as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-qualified plans was $ 171 million and $ 141 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which exceeded all corresponding plan assets for each period. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the actuarial (gains) losses related to the change in the benefit obligation were primarily driven by changes in the discount rate. 

Net periodic pension cost (benefit) included the following components for the years ended December 31 :

Regions utilizes a disaggregated approach in the estimation of the service and interest components of net periodic pension costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. 

The expected long-term rate of return on the qualified plans' assets is based on an estimated reasonable range of probable returns. The assumption is established by considering historical and anticipated return of the asset classes invested in by the qualified plans and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. Management chose a point within the range based on the probability of achievement combined with incremental returns attributable to active management. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 6.74 percent. 

The qualified plans' investment strategy is continuing to shift from focusing on maximizing asset returns to minimizing funding ratio volatility, with a planned increase in the allocation to fixed income securities. The combined target asset allocation is 51 percent equities, 37 percent fixed income securities and 12 percent in all other types of investments. Equity securities include investments in large and small/mid cap companies primarily located in the U.S., international equities, and private equities. Fixed income securities include investments in corporate and government bonds, asset-backed securities and any other fixed income investments as allowed by respective prospectuses and other offering documents. Other types of investments may include hedge funds and real estate funds that follow several different strategies. The plans' assets are highly diversified with respect to asset class, security and manager. Investment risk is controlled with the plans' assets rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers&#8217; performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. 

Regions&#8217; qualified plans have a portion of their investments in Regions' common stock. At December 31, 2019 , the plans held 2,855,618 shares, which represents a total market value of approximately $ 49.0 million, or approximately 2.2 percent of the plans' assets.

##TABLE_END

__________ 

(1) In accordance with accounting guidance, investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy to amounts reported on the balance sheet. 

For all investments, the plans attempt to use quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges, or Level 1 measurements. Where such quoted market prices are not available, the plans typically employ quoted market prices of similar instruments (including matrix pricing) and/or discounted cash flows to estimate a value of these securities, or Level 2 measurements. Level 2 discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on market interest rates, prepayment speeds and/or option adjusted spreads. 

Investments held in the plans consist of cash and cash equivalents, fixed income securities , equity securities, collective trust funds, hedge funds, real estate funds, private equity and other assets and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. See Note 1 for a description of valuation methodologies related to U.S. Treasuries, federal agency securities, and equity securities. The methodology described in Note 1 for other debt securities is applicable to corporate bonds. 

Mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges; these valuations are Level 1 measurements. Collective trust funds, hedge funds, real estate funds, private equity funds and other assets are valued based on net asset value or the valuation of the limited partner&#8217;s portion of the equity of the fund. Third party fund managers provide these valuations based primarily on estimated valuations of underlying investments.

OTHER PLANS 

Regions has a defined-contribution 401(k) plan that includes a Company match of eligible employee contributions. Eligible employees include those who have been employed for one year and have worked a minimum of 1,000 hours. The Company match is invested based on the employees' allocation elections. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , Regions provided an automatic 2 percent cash 401(k) contribution to eligible employees regardless of whether or not they were contributing to the 401(k) plan. To receive this contribution, employees must be employed at the end of the year and not actively accruing a benefit in the Regions&#8217; pension plans. Regions&#8217; cash contribution was approximately $ 17 million for 2019 and $ 18 million for both 2018 and 2017 . For 2019, eligible employees who were already contributing to the 401(k) plan received up to a 5 percent Company match plus the automatic 2 percent cash contribution. In 2018 and 2017, eligible employees who were already contributing to the 401(k) plan received up to a 4 percent Company match plus the automatic 2 percent cash contribution. Regions&#8217; match to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled $ 58 million in 2019 and $ 48 million in both 2018 and 2017 . Regions&#8217; 401(k) plan held 21 million shares and 23 million shares of Regions' common stock at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The 401(k) plan received approximately $ 13 million, $ 10 million and $ 8 million in dividends on Regions' common stock for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

Regions also sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that cover certain retired employees. For these certain employees retiring before normal retirement age, the Company currently pays a portion of the costs of certain health care benefits until the retired employee becomes eligible for Medicare. Certain retirees, participating in plans of acquired entities, are offered a Medicare supplemental benefit. The plan is contributory and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and co-payments. Retiree health care benefits, as well as similar benefits for active employees, are provided through a self-insured program in which Company and retiree costs are based on the amount of benefits paid. The Company&#8217;s policy is to fund the Company&#8217;s share of the cost of health care benefits in amounts determined at the discretion of management. Postretirement life insurance is also provided to a grandfathered group of employees and retirees.

Note: The table above does not include total income tax expense (benefit) from discontinued operations of zero, $ 80 million , and $( 3 ) million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The deferred income tax expense (benefit) reflected in discontinued operations was zero, $ 43 million and $( 7 ) million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1, 2018, Tax Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent . With the enactment of Tax Reform, the Company recognized additional income tax expense of approximately $ 61 million at December 31, 2017. This amount represented an estimate based on information available at December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company made the determination to and completed administrative filings with the Internal Revenue Service that allowed it to accelerate various deductions into 2017. As a result, the Company recognized during the 2018 measurement period approximately $ 37 million in tax benefits due to Tax Reform. The measurement period ended in December 2018. 

Except for the revaluation adjustment recorded in 2017 due to Tax Reform related to unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity, income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized losses on securities transferred to held to maturity, unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and the net change from defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Refer to Note 15 for additional information on stockholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

The Company accounts for investment tax credits using the deferral method. Investment tax credits generated totaled $ 59 million , $ 90 million and $ 102 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

Income taxes from continuing operations for financial reporting purposes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 35 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017 , as shown in the following table:

##TABLE_END

________ 

(1) N/A indicates that net operating losses with no expiration and tax credits are not measured on a pre-tax basis. 

As detailed in the table above, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $ 30 million net of valuation allowance related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2019, of which $ 16 million will expire before 2032 (as detailed in the table above). 

The Company&#8217;s determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based on its assessment of all available positive and negative evidence. At December 31, 2019 , positive evidence supporting the realization of the deferred tax assets includes a history of positive earnings with no history of significant tax credit carryforwards expiring unused. In addition, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, excluding goodwill and the inclusion of the accretion of taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases acquired in a previous business combination, will offset approximately $ 718 million of the gross deferred tax assets, which is significantly larger than the $ 461 million deferred tax asset balance net of valuation allowance at December 31, 2019. 

. 

The Company believes that a portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards will not be realized due to the length of certain state carryforward periods. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established in the amount of $ 32 million against such benefits at December 31, 2019 compared to $ 30 million at December 31, 2018 . 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

##TABLE_END

The Company files U.S. federal, state, and local income tax returns. In 2015, the Company entered the IRS&#8217;s Compliance Assurance Process program and tax years 2018 and 2019 remain open. Other than potential adjustments related to credits claimed through amended returns, tax years prior to 2018 are no longer subject to examination by the IRS. Also, with few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2015. Currently, there are no material disputed tax positions with federal or state taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate that any adjustments relating to federal or state tax examinations will result in material changes to its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

As a result of the potential resolution of certain federal and state income tax positions, it is reasonably possible that the UTBs could decrease as much as $ 28 million during the next twelve months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition in earnings. 

As of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the balances of the Company&#8217;s UTBs that would reduce the effective tax rates, if recognized, were $ 34 million , $ 10 million and $ 21 million , respectively. The remainder of the UTB balance has indirect tax benefits in other jurisdictions or is the tax effect of temporary differences. 

Income tax expense for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , includes a total expense (benefit) of $ 1 million, $( 2 ) million and $( 2 ) million, respectively, for interest expense, interest income and penalties before the impact of any applicable federal and state deductions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had a liability of $ 1 million and zero , respectively, for interest and penalties related to income taxes, before the impact of any applicable federal and state deductions.

_________ 

##TABLE_START (1) 

Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. There is no fair value presented for contracts that are characterized as settled daily. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Estimated fair value includes premium and change in fair value of the interest rate floors. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) 

The gain amounts, which are not collateralized with cash or other assets or reserved for, represent the net credit risk on all trading and other derivative positions. Financial instruments posted of $ 24 million were not offset in the consolidated balance sheets at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

##TABLE_END Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company executed net terminations of $ 1.25 billion notional value cash flow hedging relationships. 

HEDGING DERIVATIVES 

Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives. Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives is described in Note 1. 

FAIR VALUE HEDGES 

Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment. 

Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure on the Company&#8217;s fixed-rate borrowings. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts. 

CASH FLOW HEDGES 

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. 

Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company&#8217;s exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps and interest rate floors. 

Regions recognized an unrealized after-tax gain of $ 58 million and $ 51 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, related to discontinued cash flow hedges of loan instruments which will be amortized into earnings in conjunction with the recognition of interest payments through 2026. Regions recognized pre-tax income of $ 14 million and $ 45 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges of loan instruments. 

Regions expects to reclassify into earnings approximately $ 50 million in pre-tax expense due to the receipt or payment of interest payments and floor premium amortization on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is $ 9 million in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which Regions is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately 7 years as of December 31, 2019 , and a portion of these hedges are forward starting. 

The following tables present the effect of hedging derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of income and the total amounts for the respective line items affected for the years ended December 31 :

During 2019 and 2018, the Company terminated fair value hedges related to available for sale debt securities with carrying values of $ 337 million and $ 604 million, respectively. The remaining basis adjustments related to these terminated hedges were $ 3 million and $ 4 million, respectively. The Company also de-designated fair value hedges in conjunction with a 2019 debt tender offer. New fair value hedges were transacted for the debt that was not tendered and the basis adjustment of $ 2 million related to the terminated fair value hedges was included in the carrying amount of the remaining debt at December 31, 2019. See Note 12 for further information regarding the debt tender offer. 

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS 

The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital markets income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as appropriate. 

Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Regions had $ 366 million and $ 191 million , respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair value based on management's election. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Regions had $ 662 million and $ 429 million , respectively, in total notional amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and 

corresponding forward sale commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans are included in capital markets income. 

Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Concurrent with the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various derivative instruments, in the form of forward rate commitments, futures contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the total notional amount related to these contracts was $ 4.8 billion and $ 5.7 billion , respectively. 

The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31 :

CREDIT DERIVATIVES 

Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2020 and 2029. Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have maturities between 2020 and 2038. For contracts where Regions sold credit protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management practices of unfunded commitments. 

Regions&#8217; maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $ 592 million . This scenario occurs if variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions&#8217; obligation. 

Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices. These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the tranche rating of the capital structure. 

CONTINGENT FEATURES 

Certain of Regions&#8217; derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit related provisions regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to terminate the contracts in the event that Regions&#8217; and/or Regions Bank&#8217;s credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December 31, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 64 million and $ 45 million , respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $ 67 million and $ 43 million , respectively, in the normal course of business. 

NOTE 22. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

See Note 1 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3 valuation based on management&#8217;s conclusion regarding the observability of inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if they occur at the beginning of a reporting period. 

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis as of December 31 :

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions&#8217; consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3 are used by ALCO in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks. 

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for all material assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS 

Residential mortgage servicing rights 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are OAS and CPR. This valuation requires generating cash flow projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash flows at a risk adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 7 . 

FAIR VALUE OPTION 

Regions has elected the fair value option for all eligible agency residential mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. 

The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale measured at fair value at December 31 :

##TABLE_END

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income for the years presented. These changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

NOTE 23. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION 

Each of Regions&#8217; reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves specific needs of Regions&#8217; customers based on the products and services provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. 

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be periodically revised. 

The Corporate Bank segment represents the Company&#8217;s commercial banking functions including commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and investor real estate lending. This segment also includes equipment lease financing, as well as capital markets activities, which include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Corporate Bank customers include corporate, middle market, and commercial real estate developers and investors. Corresponding deposit products related to these types of customers are also included in this segment. 

The Consumer Bank segment represents the Company&#8217;s branch network, including consumer banking products and services related to residential first mortgages, home equity lines and loans, branch small business loans, indirect loans, consumer credit cards and other consumer loans, as well as the corresponding deposit relationships. These services are also provided through alternative channels such as the internet and telephone banking. 

The Wealth Management segment offers individuals, businesses, governmental institutions and non-profit entities a wide range of solutions to help protect, grow and transfer wealth. Offerings include credit related products, trust and investment management, asset management, retirement and savings solutions and estate planning. 

Discontinued operations includes all brokerage and investment activities associated with the sale of Morgan Keegan which closed on April 2, 2012, as well as the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates, which closed on July 2, 2018. See Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" for related discussion. 

Other includes the Company&#8217;s Treasury function, the securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, interest rate risk management activities and other corporate functions that are not related to a strategic business unit. Also within Other are certain reconciling items in order to translate the segment results that are based on management accounting practices into consolidated results. Management accounting practices utilized by Regions as the basis of presentation for segment results include the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Net interest income and other financing income is presented based upon an FTP approach, for which market-based funding charges/credits are assigned within the segments. By allocating a cost or a credit to each product based on the FTP framework, management is able to more effectively measure the net interest margin contribution of its assets/liabilities by segment. The summation of the interest income/expense and FTP charges/credits for each segment is its designated net interest income and other financing income. The variance between the Company&#8217;s cumulative FTP charges and cumulative FTP credits is offset in Other. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Provision for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on an estimated loss methodology. The difference between the consolidated provision for loan losses and the segments&#8217; estimated loss is reflected in Other. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Income tax expense (benefit) is calculated for the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management based on a consistent federal and state statutory rate. Discontinued Operations reflects the actual income tax expense (benefit) of its results. Any difference between the Company&#8217;s consolidated income tax expense (benefit) and the segments&#8217; calculated amounts is reflected in Other. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Management reporting allocations of certain expenses are made in order to analyze the financial performance of the segments. These allocations consist of operational and overhead cost pools and are intended to represent the total costs to support a segment.

NOTE 24. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES 

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 

Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is subject to Regions&#8217; normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management&#8217;s assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer. 

Credit risk associated with these instruments as of December 31 is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table:

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Unused commitments to extend credit &#8212;To accommodate the financial needs of its customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 

Standby letters of credit &#8212;Standby letters of credit are also issued to customers which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of standby letters of credit represents the maximum potential amount of future payments Regions could be required to make and represents Regions&#8217; maximum credit risk. 

Commercial letters of credit &#8212;Commercial letters of credit are issued to facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. 

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES 

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. In determining the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds are recorded in the period the recovery is received. 

In addition, Regions has agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters resulting from pre-closing activities in conjunction with the sale of Morgan Keegan and recorded an indemnification obligation at fair value in the second quarter of 2012. 

When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of what Regions has accrued in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 20 million as of December 31, 2019 , with it also being reasonably possible that Regions could incur no losses in excess of amounts accrued. However, as available information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly. The reasonably possible estimate includes legal contingencies that are subject to the indemnification agreement with Raymond James. 

Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation, are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not include an estimate for every matter disclosed below. 

Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests, investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies regarding Regions&#8217; business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the conduct of persons with whom Regions does business. Additional inquiries will arise from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries, including the one described below, could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that could result in consequences that have a material effect on Regions' consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments, findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses and collateral costs, including reputational damage. 

Regions is cooperating with an investigation by the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of New York pertaining to Regions' banking relationship with a former customer and accounts maintained by related entities and individuals 

affiliated with the customer who may be involved in criminal activity, as well as related aspects of Regions' Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program. 

While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a material effect on Regions&#8217; business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions&#8217; business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period of occurrence. 

GUARANTEES 

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION 

As discussed in Note 3 , on April 2, 2012 (&#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), Regions closed the sale of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. In connection with the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters related to pre-closing activities, including matters filed subsequent to the Closing Date that relate to actions that occurred prior to closing. Losses under the indemnification include legal and other expenses, such as costs for judgments, settlements and awards associated with the defense and resolution of the indemnified matters. The maximum potential amount of future payments that Regions could be required to make under the indemnification is indeterminable due to the indefinite term of some of the obligations. As of December 31, 2019 , the carrying value and fair value of the indemnification obligation were immaterial. 

FANNIE MAE DUS LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE 

Regions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal balance for the majority of its DUS servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $ 3.9 billion and $ 3.6 billion, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability related to its loss share guarantee was approximately $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets was approximately $ 4 million for both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Refer to Note 1 for additional information. 

VISA INDEMNIFICATION 

As a member of the Visa USA network, Regions, along with other members, indemnified Visa USA against litigation. On October 3, 2007, Visa USA was restructured and acquired several Visa affiliates. In conjunction with this restructuring, Regions' indemnification of Visa USA was modified to cover specific litigation (&#8220;covered litigation&#8221;). 

A portion of Visa's proceeds from its IPO was put into escrow to fund the covered litigation. To the extent that the amount available under the escrow arrangement, or subsequent fundings of the escrow account resulting from reductions in the class B share conversion ratio, is insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, Visa will enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa USA's members for any excess amount. At this time, Regions has concluded that it is not probable that covered litigation exposure will exceed the class B share value. 

NOTE 25. REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company records revenue when control of the promised products or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration Regions expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. Refer to Note 1 for descriptions of the accounting and reporting policies related to revenue recognition. 

The following tables present total non-interest income disaggregated by major product category for each reportable segment for the period indicated:
