REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include some amounts which are estimates based upon currently available information and management&#8217;s judgment of current conditions and circumstances. Financial information throughout this annual report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls which is believed to provide, in all material respects, reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized and recorded, and the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. In addition, Old National has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a Senior Financial and Executive Officer Code of Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines that outline high levels of ethical business standards. Old National has also appointed a Chief Ethics Officer and had a third party perform an independent validation of our ethics program. All systems of internal accounting controls are based on management&#8217;s judgment that the cost of controls should not exceed the benefits to be achieved and that no system can provide absolute assurance that control objectives are achieved. Management believes Old National&#8217;s system provides the appropriate balance between cost of controls and the related benefits.

In order to monitor compliance with this system of controls, Old National maintains an extensive internal audit program. Internal audit reports are issued to appropriate officers and significant audit exceptions, if any, are reviewed with management and the Audit Committee.

The Board of Directors, through an Audit Committee comprised solely of independent outside directors, oversees management&#8217;s discharge of its financial reporting responsibilities. The Audit Committee meets regularly with Old National&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, Crowe LLP, and the managers of financial reporting, internal audit, and risk. During these meetings, the committee meets privately with the independent registered public accounting firm as well as with financial reporting and internal audit personnel to review accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is made by the Audit Committee.

The consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K have been audited by Crowe LLP, for the purpose of determining that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Crowe LLP&#8217;s report on the financial statements follows.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Old National is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Old National&#8217;s management assessed the effectiveness of Old National&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework . Based on that assessment Old National has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, Old National&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Old National&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of Old National&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as stated in their report which follows.

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Old National Bancorp

Evansville, Indiana

&#160;

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

&#160;

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Old National Bancorp (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

&#160;

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.

&#160;

Basis for Opinions

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

&#160;

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions . 

&#160;

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

&#160;

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company&#59; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company&#59; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

&#160;

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

&#160;

Critical Audit Matter

&#160;

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

&#160;

Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses 

&#160;

As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a probability of default (PD)/loss given default (LGD) model as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for performing commercial and commercial real estate loans. The expected loss derived from the model considers the probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default. Loss rates are then adjusted by qualitative factors such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic business conditions. For residential real estate and consumer loans, management uses historical loss ratios adjusted for economic conditions to determine the appropriate level of allowance for residential real estate and consumer loans. 

&#160;

The audit of the estimate of the allowance for loan losses was identified by us as a critical audit matter because the necessary judgments applied by us to evaluate the significant subjective and complex judgments made by management. The principal considerations resulting in our determination included judgments related to the: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Accuracy of the loan risk rating for the performing commercial and commercial real estate portfolio. The PD is calculated using a transition matrix to determine the likelihood of a customer&#8217;s asset quality rating migrating from its current rating to any other rating. The calculation relies on the accuracy of the loan risk rating at a point in time as well as the accuracy of the movement for loans to the correct risk rating category. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Adjustments to the loss rates from the PD/LGD model and to the historical loss ratios for qualitative factors. The selection of qualitative factors and the magnitude of such adjustments is based on management&#8217;s judgments regarding factors which impact asset quality.

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Completeness and accuracy of data used in PD/LGD model due to the volume of loan data used in the calculation.

The primary procedures performed to address the critical audit matter included:

&#8226; 

Testing the effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s asset quality rating&#59; controls over the preparation and review of the allowance for loan loss calculation, including data used as the basis for adjustments related to the qualitative factors, completeness and accuracy of loan data used in the computations, the development and reasonableness of qualitative factors and mathematical accuracy of the overall calculation&#59;

OLD NATIONAL BANCORP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Old National Bancorp, a financial holding company headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, operates primarily in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Its principal subsidiary is Old National Bank. Through its bank and non-bank affiliates, Old National Bancorp provides to its clients an array of financial services including loan, deposit, wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products.

NOTE 1 &#8211; BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Old National Bancorp and its wholly-owned affiliates (hereinafter collectively referred to as &#8220;Old National&#8221;) and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry. Such principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or shareholders&#8217; equity and were insignificant amounts.

Equity Securities

Equity securities consist of mutual funds held in trusts associated with deferred compensation plans for former directors and executives. These mutual funds are recorded as equity securities at fair value. Gains and losses are included in other income in the current year and net securities gains in 2018 and 2017.

Investment Securities

Old National classified all of its debt investment securities as available-for-sale at December 31, 2019. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax effect, recorded in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses affect income and the prior fair value adjustments are reclassified within shareholders&#8217; equity. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, Old National also had debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, which management had the intent and ability to hold to maturity, were reported at amortized cost. Interest income included amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts were amortized on the level-yield method. Anticipated prepayments were considered when amortizing premiums and discounts on mortgage backed securities. Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities are determined using the specific-identification method.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment &#8211; Management evaluates debt securities for OTTI at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. If Old National intends to sell an impaired debt security, Old National records an other-than-temporary loss in an amount equal to the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost. If a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, but Old National does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, only the credit portion of the estimated loss is recognized in earnings, with the other portion of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the quarterly evaluation process. 

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock

Old National is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. 

Loans Held for Sale

Loans that Old National has originated with an intent to sell are classified as loans held for sale and are recorded at fair value, determined individually, as of the balance sheet date. The loan&#8217;s fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest.

Loans

Loans that Old National intends to hold for investment purposes are classified as portfolio loans. Portfolio loans are carried at the principal balance outstanding, net of earned interest, purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the principal balances of loans outstanding. For all loan classes, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. Interest accrued during the current year on such loans is reversed against earnings. Interest accrued in the prior year, if any, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Cash interest received on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the principal is recovered or until the loan returns to accrual status. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, remain current for a prescribed period, and future payments are reasonably assured.

Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date with no carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses. In determining the estimated fair value of purchased loans, management considers a number of factors including, among others, the remaining life of the acquired loans, estimated prepayments, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and net present value of cash flows expected to be received. Purchased loans are accounted for in accordance with guidance for certain loans acquired in a transfer (ASC 310-30), when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the acquirer will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan and lease losses. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows will result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and then an adjustment to accretable yield, which would have a positive impact on interest income.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, pools of homogeneous loans, assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio, and historical loss experience. The allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance. Recoveries of loans previously charged-off are added to the allowance.

For all loan classes, a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated cash flows using the loan&#8217;s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Old National&#8217;s policy, for all but PCI loans, is to recognize interest income on impaired loans unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.

Acquired loans accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30 accrue interest, even though they may be contractually past due, as any nonpayment of contractual principal or interest is considered in the periodic re-estimation of expected cash flows and is included in the resulting recognition of current period loan loss provision or prospective yield adjustments.

&#160;

Old National charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under $ 250,000 that are 90 days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support.

For all portfolio segments, the general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans&#59; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries&#59; trends in volume and terms of loans&#59; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards&#59; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices&#59; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff&#59; national and local economic trends and conditions&#59; industry conditions&#59; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. 

Further information regarding Old National&#8217;s policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses is presented in Note 5.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is stated at cost. Depreciation is charged to operating expense over the useful lives of the assets, principally on the straight-line method. Useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows: buildings and building improvements &#8211; 15 to 39 years&#59; and furniture and equipment &#8211; 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major additions and improvements are capitalized. Interest costs on construction of qualifying assets are capitalized. 

Premises and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are adjusted to fair value. Such impairments are included in other expense.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets is not recorded. However, the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets are annually tested for impairment. Other intangible assets, including core deposits and customer business relationships, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, generally over a period of 5 to 15 years.

Company-Owned Life Insurance

Old National has purchased, as well as obtained through acquisitions, life insurance policies on certain key executives. Old National records company-owned life insurance at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.

Loan Servicing Rights

When loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gain on sales of loans. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans.

Loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, term, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If Old National later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with mortgage banking revenue on the income statement. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.

&#160;

Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement as mortgage banking revenue, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal , or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. 

Derivative Financial Instruments

As part of Old National&#8217;s overall interest rate risk management, Old National uses derivative instruments, including TBA forward agreements and interest rate swaps, collars, caps, and floors. All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. At the inception of the derivative contract, Old National designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (&#8220;fair value hedge&#8221;), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (&#8220;cash flow hedge&#8221;), or (3) an instrument with no hedging designation (&#8220;stand-alone derivative&#8221;). For a fair value hedge, the change in value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting change in value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported currently in earnings, in noninterest income.

Net cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in noninterest income.

Old National formally documents all relationships between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This documentation includes linking fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Old National also formally assesses, both at the hedge&#8217;s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Old National discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that (1) the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item&#59; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, or terminated&#59; (3) the derivative instrument is de-designated as a hedge because the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring&#59; (4) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment&#59; (5) or management otherwise determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 

When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized or accreted over the remaining life of the asset or liability. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transaction is still expected to occur, changes in value that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized or accreted into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings.

Old National enters into various stand-alone mortgage-banking derivatives in order to hedge the risk associated with the fluctuation of interest rates. Changes in fair value are recorded as mortgage banking revenue. Old National also enters into various stand-alone derivative contracts to provide derivative products to customers which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as other noninterest income.

Old National is exposed to losses if a counterparty fails to make its payments under a contract in which Old National is in the net receiving position. Old National anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements. In addition, Old National obtains collateral above certain thresholds of the fair value of its hedges for each counterparty based upon their credit standing. All of the contracts to which Old National is a party settle monthly, quarterly, or semiannually. Further, Old National has netting agreements with the dealers with which it does business.

Credit-Related Financial Instruments

In the ordinary course of business, Old National&#8217;s affiliate bank has entered into credit-related financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The notional amount of these commitments is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements until they are funded.

&#160;

Repossessed Collateral

Other real estate owned and repossessed personal property are initially recorded at the fair value of the property less estimated cost to sell. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through the completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement Any excess recorded investment over the fair value of the property received is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded in noninterest expense, as are the costs of operating the properties. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of sale.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

We purchase certain securities, generally U.S. government-sponsored entity and agency securities, under agreements to resell. The amounts advanced under these agreements represent short-term secured loans and are reflected as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase. These agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions. These secured borrowings are reflected as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. Short-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Securities, generally U.S. government and federal agency securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements can be repledged by the secured party. Additional collateral may be required based on the fair value of the underlying securities.

&#160;

Share-Based Compensation

Compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards and units issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. A third party provider is used to value certain restricted stock units where the performance measure is based on total shareholder return. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test, no tax benefit is recorded.

We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Old National is a limited partner in several tax-advantaged limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest in approved qualified affordable housing, renewable energy, or other renovation or community revitalization projects. These investments are included in other assets on the balance sheet, with any unfunded commitments included with other liabilities. Certain of these assets qualify for the proportional amortization method and are amortized over the period that Old National expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense included within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. The other investments are accounted for under the equity method, with the expense included within noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of income. All of our tax credit investments are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period.

&#160;

Loss Contingencies

Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure.

Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows

For the purpose of presentation in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash, due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements, and money market investments, which have maturities less than 90 days. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired, are classified at that time according to management&#8217;s intent to either sell or hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management&#8217;s intent is to sell the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented as operating cash flows. When management&#8217;s intent is to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, the cash flows of that loan are presented as investing cash flows.

&#160;

Business Combinations

&#160;

Old National accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Old National typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of common shares issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.

Impact of Accounting Changes

&#160;

Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2019

&#160;

FASB ASC 842 &#8211; In February 2016, the FASB issued its new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis&#59; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. 

&#160;

In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases and ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements . ASU No. 2018-10 provides improvements related to ASU No. 2016-02 to increase stakeholders&#8217; awareness of the amendments and to expedite the improvements. The amendments affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU No. 2016-02. ASU No. 2018-11 allows entities adopting ASU No. 2016-02 to choose an additional (and optional) transition method, under which an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASU No. 2018-11 also allows lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are met. The amendments in these updates became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.

&#160;

Old National elected the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11. Under this method, an entity shall recognize and measure leases that exist at the application date and prior comparative periods are not adjusted. In addition, Old National elected the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced before the effective date:

##TABLE_START &#160;

1. 

An entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

2. 

An entity need not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

3. 

An entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases.

##TABLE_END

Old National also elected the practical expedient, which must be applied consistently to all leases, to use hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of our right-of-use assets. We also elected a practical expedient to not assess whether existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under Topic 840 contain a lease under this Topic. Both of these practical expedients may be elected separately or in conjunction with each other or the package noted above.

Based on both operating and finance leases outstanding at December 31, 2018, the impact of adoption on January 1, 2019 was recording a lease liability of $ 122.9 million, a right-of-use asset of $ 118.7 million, and a cumulative-effect adjustment of $ 6.3 million to increase retained earnings.

FASB ASC 310 &#8211; In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Receivables &#8211; Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities . This update amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. FASB is shortening the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. Under current GAAP, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life of the instrument. Concerns were raised that current GAAP excludes certain callable debt securities from consideration of early repayment of principal even if the holder is certain that the call will be exercised. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. There is diversity in practice (1) in the amortization period for premiums of callable debt securities and (2) in how the potential for exercise of a call is factored into current impairment assessments. The amendments in this update became effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 718 &#8211; In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation (which currently only includes share-based payments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned. The ASU 

&#160;

supersedes Subtopic 505-50, Equity&#8212;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The amendments in this update became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

FASB ASC 958 &#8211; In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-08, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made. The amendments in this update clarify and improve the scope and accounting guidance around contributions of cash and other assets received and made by not-for-profit organizations and business enterprises. The ASU clarifies and improves current guidance about whether a transfer of assets, or the reduction, settlement, or cancellation of liabilities, is a contribution or an exchange transaction. It provides criteria for determining whether the resource provider is receiving commensurate value in return for the resources transferred which, depending on the outcome, determines whether the organization follows contribution guidance or exchange transaction guidance in the revenue recognition and other applicable standards. It also provides a more robust framework for determining whether a contribution is conditional or unconditional, and for distinguishing a donor-imposed condition from a donor-imposed restriction. This is important because such classification affects the timing of contribution revenue and expense recognition. The new ASU does not apply to transfers of assets from governments to businesses. The amendments in this update became effective for a public business entity for transactions in which the entity serves as a resource recipient to annual periods beginning after June 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments in this update became effective for a public business entity for transactions in which the entity serves as a resource provider to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods and there was no impact. 

&#160;

FASB ASC 815 &#8211; In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting. In the United States, eligible benchmark interest rates under Topic 815 are interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government (&#8220;UST&#8221;), the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) swap rate, and the Overnight Index Swap (&#8220;OIS&#8221;) Rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate. When the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , in August 2017, it introduced the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (&#8220;SIFMA&#8221;) Municipal Swap Rate as the fourth permissible U.S. benchmark rate. 

The new ASU adds the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate to facilitate the LIBOR to SOFR transition and provide sufficient lead time for entities to prepare for changes to interest rate risk hedging strategies for both risk management and hedge accounting purposes. The amendments in this update became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years and the financial statement impact immediately upon adoption was immaterial. The future financial statement impact will depend on any new contracts entered into using new benchmark rates, as well as any existing contracts that get migrated from LIBOR to new benchmark interest rates. The Company has formed a working group who is developing a transition plan for all exposed contracts migrating from LIBOR to SOFR. The Company has identified contracts that reflect exposure associated with LIBOR-indexed financial instruments that mature beyond 2021 in an aggregate notional amount of $ 4.8 billion. Additionally, the working group is monitoring industry specific transition guidance around a LIBOR contract&#8217;s &#8220;fallback&#8221; language with the industry goal to minimize or eliminate value transfers resulting from the transition. The associated risks identified include dependence on third parties for critical decisions regarding SOFR index calculations, spread adjustments, term rate development, and product development, which may impact the bank&#8217;s ability to establish more detailed timelines for action.

&#160;

Codification Updates to SEC Sections &#8211; In July 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-07, Codification Updates to SEC Sections , which amends certain SEC sections or paragraphs within the Accounting Standards Codification to reflect changes in SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532, &#8220;Disclosure Update and Simplification,&#8221; and 33-10231 and 33-10442, &#8220;Investment Company Reporting Modernization.&#8221; Other revisions in ASU No. 2019-07 update language in the codification to match the electronic Code of Federal Regulations. The amendments became effective upon addition to the FASB Codification and there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Yet Adopted in 2019

&#160;

FASB ASC 326 &#8211; In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&#8220;CECL&#8221;). The main objective of this amendment is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on 

&#160;

financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendment requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to enhance their credit loss estimates. The amendment requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization&#8217;s portfolio. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The current expected credit loss measurement will be used to estimate the allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) over the life of the financial assets. The amendments in th is update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption w as permitted beginning after December 15, 2018. 

As previously disclosed, Old National formed a cross functional committee to oversee the adoption of the ASU and a working group was also formed to implement provisions of the ASU. The working group identified and developed seven distinct loan segments for which models have been developed. Management monitors and assesses credit risk based on these loan segments.

Old National has completed data and model validation testing, model sensitivity analysis, the determination of qualitative adjustments, other supporting analytics, and the development of related internal controls over model inputs (data and assumptions) and model operations. While the models are operationally complete, other required processes are being finalized.

&#160;

The CECL modeling measurements for estimating the current expected life-time credit losses for loans and debt securities includes the following major items:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Initial forecast &#8211; using a period of one year for all portfolio segments and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, using forward-looking economic scenarios of expected losses. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Historical loss forecast &#8211; for a period incorporating the remaining contractual life, adjusted for prepayments, and the changes in various economic variables during representative historical and recessionary periods. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Reversion period &#8211; using two years, which links the initial loss forecast to the historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Discounted cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) aggregator &#8211; using the items above to estimate the life-time credit losses for all portfolios and losses for loans modified as a TDR. 

##TABLE_END

Old National has not completed finalizing the results of the CECL estimate as of year-end. The required financial reporting disclosures are being further refined and internally validated. Internal controls over financial reporting specifically related to CECL have been designed and are being evaluated&#59; however, all internal controls related to CECL implementation are not operational. Old National is in the final stages of completing the formal governance and approval process.

During the first quarter of 2020, Old National expects formal approval from all internal committees and governance processes related to CECL. At that time, the cross functional committee will be disbanded, along with the current Allowance for Loan Losses Committee and replaced with an Allowance for Credit Losses Committee who will provide oversight for the entire CECL model and allowance process. 

&#160;

Old National expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment increasing the allowance for loan losses. Because we do not have final approval from our oversight and governance committees, we are estimating an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $ 35 million to $ 45 million upon adoption, which includes a range of $ 3 million to $ 8 million for off-balance sheet exposures. The vast majority of this increase is related to the acquired loan portfolio. Under the current accounting guidance, any remaining unamortized loan discount on an individual loan can be used to offset a charge-off for that loan, so the allowance for loan losses needed for the acquired loans is reduced by the remaining loan discounts. The new accounting under the ASU removes the ability to offset a charge-off against the remaining loan discount and requires an allowance for credit losses to be recognized in addition to the loan discount. The ultimate impact of adopting the ASU, and at each subsequent reporting period, is highly dependent on credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, composition of our loans and available-for-sale securities portfolio, along with other management judgements. The transition adjustment to record the allowance for credit losses may fall outside of management&#8217;s estimated increase 

&#160;

based on material changes in these dependencies, specifically the macroeconomic forecast and conditions and loan composition, used in calculating the allowance for credit losses upon the adoption of CECL. 

&#160;

Old National does not expect a material allowance for credit losses to be recorded on its available-for-sale debt securities under the newly codified available-for-sale debt security impairment model, as the majority of these securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal . 

&#160;

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. Old National is planning on adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible three-year period.

FASB ASC 350 &#8211; In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles: Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value&#59; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, the income tax effects of tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the qualitative impairment test is necessary. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments in this update should be adopted for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and will not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

FASB ASC 820 &#8211; In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . The updated guidance improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The ASU removes certain disclosures required by Topic 820 related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy&#59; the policy for timing of transfers between levels&#59; the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements&#59; and for nonpublic entities, the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in earnings for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period. The ASU modifies certain disclosures required by Topic 820 related to disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities for nonpublic entities&#59; the requirement to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investee&#8217;s assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to the entity or announced the timing publicly for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value&#59; and clarification that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date. The ASU adds certain disclosure requirements related to changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information in lieu of the weighted average if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and will not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

&#160;

FASB ASC 715 &#8211; In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits &#8211; Defined Benefit Plans &#8211; General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans . The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

&#160;

FASB ASC 350 &#8211; In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract . The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years and will not have a material impact on the financial statements . 

&#160;

FASB ASC 842 &#8211; In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements . The amendments in ASU No. 2019-01 align the guidance for fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance. As a result, the fair value of the underlying asset at lease commencement is its cost, reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply. However, if there has been a significant lapse of time between when the underlying asset is acquired and when the lease commences, the definition of fair value in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement should be applied. ASU No. 2019-01 also requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, Financial Services&#8212;Depository and Lending , to present all &#8220;principal payments received under leases&#8221; within investing activities. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

&#160;

FASB ASC 326, 815, and 825 &#8211; In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. The amendments related to Topic 326 address accrued interest, transfers between classifications or categories for loans and debt securities, recoveries, vintage disclosures, and contractual extensions and renewal options and will become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The improvements and clarifications related to Topic 815 address partial-term fair value hedges of interest-rate risk, amortization, and disclosure of fair value hedge basis adjustments and consideration of hedged contractually specified interest rate under the hypothetical method and will become effective for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. The amendments related to Topic 825 contain various improvements to ASU 2016-01, including scope&#59; held-to-maturity debt securities fair value disclosures&#59; and remeasurement of equity securities at historical exchange rates and will become effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a material impact. 

&#160;

FASB ASC 326 &#8211; In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These amendments provide targeted transition relief allowing entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, for certain financial assets (excluding held-to-maturity debt securities) previously measured at amortized cost. 

&#160;

In November 2019, the FASB issued 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses , to make improvements to the credit losses standard. Most significantly, the standard clarifies guidance around how to report expected recoveries for PCD assets. &#8220;Expected recoveries&#8221; describes a situation in which an organization recognizes a full or partial writeoff of the amortized cost basis of a financial asset, but then later determines that the amount written off, or a portion of that amount, will in fact be recovered. This ASU permits organizations to record expected recoveries on PCD assets. In addition to other narrow technical improvements, the ASU also reinforces existing guidance that prohibits organizations from recognizing negative allowances for available-for-sale debt securities. 

&#160;

The amendments in these updates become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

FASB ASC 718 &#8211; In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-08, Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements&#8212;Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. This ASU requires companies to measure and classify (on the balance sheet) share-based payments to customers by applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation . As a result, the amount recorded as a reduction in revenue would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods 

&#160;

within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements . 

&#160;

FASB ASC 740 &#8211; In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation&#59; (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments&#59; and (3) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improves financial statement preparers&#8217; application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income&#59; (2) transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill&#59; (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax&#59; and (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 2 &#8211; ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY

Acquisitions

&#160;

Klein Financial, Inc.

&#160;

Effective November 1, 2018, Old National completed the acquisition of Minnesota-based Klein through a 100 % stock merger. Klein was a bank holding company with KleinBank as its wholly-owned subsidiary. Founded in 1907 and headquartered in Chaska, Minnesota with 18 full-service branches, KleinBank was the largest family-owned community bank serving the Twin Cities and its western communities. Old National achieved cost savings by integrating the two companies and combining accounting, data processing, retail and lending support, and other administrative functions, which enabled Old National to achieve economies of scale in these areas.

&#160;

Pursuant to the merger agreement, each holder of Klein common stock received 7.92 shares of Old National Common Stock per share of Klein common stock such holder owned. The total fair value of consideration for Klein was $ 406.5 million, consisting of 22.8 million shares of Old National Common Stock valued at $ 406.5 million. Through December 31, 2019, transaction and integration costs of $ 20.3 million associated with this acquisition have been expensed. Old National does not anticipate additional expenses related to this acquisition.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2019, Old National finalized its valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulting in immaterial changes to acquisition accounting adjustments. A summary of the fair values of the acquired assets, liabilities assumed, and resulting goodwill follows (in thousands):

Divestitures

On October 26, 2018, Old National divested ten branches in Wisconsin to Marine Credit Union of La Crosse, Wisconsin. At closing, the purchasers assumed $ 230.6 million in deposits and no loans. Old National recorded a net pre-tax gain of $ 14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included a deposit premium of $ 15.0 million, goodwill allocation of $ 0.6 million, and $ 0.4 million of other transaction expenses . 

Based on an ongoing assessment of our service and delivery network, Old National consolidated ten banking centers in 2018 and one additional banking center in 2019. On January 21, 2020, Old National announced a plan to close 31 banking centers throughout its footprint: ten banking centers in each of Wisconsin and Indiana, five in Michigan, four in Minnesota and two in Kentucky. The Company expects to complete the optimization during the second quarter of 2020. In addition, Old National plans to close several non-branch facilities at a later date.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of 2019, Old National inadvertently sold six held-to-maturity classified municipal bond investment securities valued at $ 9.7 million for a gain of $ 0.3 million. After the trade settled, Old National determined the sale of the held-to-maturity investment securities was not one of the permissible sale exceptions afforded by the current accounting guidance. Accordingly, Old National reclassified the entire held-to-maturity portfolio totaling $ 382.0 million into the available-for-sale portfolio, which increased capital by $ 19.4 million. The increase in capital included $ 13.0 million of unrealized holding gains at the date of transfer, net of tax, which is included on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities of $ 93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management does not expect to use the held-to-maturity category for at least the next two years.

&#160;

&#160;

Proceeds from sales or calls of available-for-sale investment securities, the resulting realized gains and realized losses, and other securities gains or losses were as follows for the years ended December 31:

##TABLE_END

Investment securities pledged to secure public and other funds had a carrying value of $ 2.104 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 2.404 billion at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2019, Old National had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values: $ 400.2 million by Indiana, which represented 14.0 % of shareholders&#8217; equity, and $ 165.7 million by Texas, which represented 5.8 % of shareholders&#8217; equity. Of the Indiana municipal bonds, 99 % are rated &#8220;A&#8221; or better, and the remaining 1 % generally represent non-rated local interest bonds where Old National has a market presence. All of the Texas municipal bonds are rated &#8220;A&#8221; or better, and the majority of issues are backed by the &#8220;AAA&#8221; rated State of Texas Permanent School Fund Guarantee Program.

All of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio are residential mortgage-backed securities. The amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio are shown by contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Weighted average yield is based on amortized cost.

##TABLE_END

The unrecognized losses on held-to-maturity investment securities presented in the table above include unrecognized losses on securities that were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity totaling $ 10.7 million at December 31, 2018. There were no held-to-maturity investment securities with unrecognized losses at December 31, 2019.

Management evaluates debt securities for OTTI at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. Management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time . 

When OTTI occurs, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in 

&#160;

earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment&#8217;s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Otherwise, the OTTI shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors shall be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings shall become the new amortized cost basis of the investment . 

We did no t record OTTI in 2019, 2018, or 2017.

As of December 31, 2019, Old National&#8217;s securities portfolio consisted of 1,892 securities, 249 of which were in an unrealized loss position. The unrealized losses attributable to our U.S. Treasury, U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, agency mortgage-backed securities, states and political subdivisions, and other securities are the result of fluctuations in interest rates. Our pooled trust preferred securities are discussed below. At December 31, 2019, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.

Pooled Trust Preferred Securities

At December 31, 2019, our securities portfolio contained two pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of $ 8.2 million and unrealized losses of $ 5.6 million. These securities are evaluated using collateral-specific assumptions to estimate the expected future interest and principal cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our analysis indicated no OTTI on these securities.

The table below summarizes the relevant characteristics of our pooled trust preferred securities as well as our single issuer trust preferred securities that are included in the &#8220;other securities&#8221; category in this footnote. Each of the pooled trust preferred securities support a more senior tranche of security holders. Both pooled trust preferred securities have experienced credit defaults. However, these securities have excess subordination and are not other-than-temporarily impaired as a result of their class hierarchy, which provides more loss protection.

Equity Securities

Equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled $ 6.8 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 5.6 million at December 31, 2018. There were gains on equity securities of $ 0.7 million during 2019, $ 0.1 million during 2018, and $ 0.7 million during 2017. Old National also has equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are included in other assets that totaled $ 91.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 79.2 million at December 31, 2018. These are illiquid investments that consist of partnerships, limited liability companies, and other ownership interests that support affordable housing, economic development, and community revitalization initiatives in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. There have been no impairments or downward adjustments on these securities in 2019 or 2018.

NOTE 4 &#8211; LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were $ 46.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $ 14.9 million at December 31, 2018. Residential loans that Old National has originated with the intent to sell are recorded at fair value. Conventional mortgage production is sold on a servicing retained basis. Certain loans, such as government guaranteed mortgage loans are sold on servicing released basis.

NOTE 5 &#8211; LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

Old National&#8217;s loans consist primarily of loans made to consumers and commercial clients in various industries including manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Most of Old National&#8217;s lending activity occurs within our principal geographic markets of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship, and loan size. While loans to lessors of both residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10 % of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold.

The composition of loans at December 31 by lending classification was as follows:

The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows:

Commercial

Commercial loans are primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee&#59; however, some loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing Old National&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans.

&#160;

Included with commercial real estate are construction loans, which are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and feasibility studies, if available. Construction loans are generally based on estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders (including Old National), sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from Old National until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing . 

At 194 %, Old National Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loans as a percentage of its risk-based capital remained well below the regulatory guideline limit of 300 % at December 31, 2019.

Residential

With respect to residential loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner occupied, Old National typically establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and generally requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in residential property values. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

Consumer

Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences, and consumer loans are secured by consumer assets such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer loans are unsecured such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in residential property or other collateral values. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

Related Party Loans

In the ordinary course of business, Old National grants loans to certain executive officers, directors, and significant subsidiaries (collectively referred to as &#8220;related parties&#8221;).

Activity in related party loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 is presented in the following table:

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, pools of homogeneous loans, assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio, and historical loss experience. The allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance. Recoveries of loans previously charged-off are added to the allowance.

&#160;

We utilize a PD and LGD model as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for performing commercial and commercial real estate loans. The PD is forecast using a transition matrix to determine the likelihood of a customer&#8217;s AQR migrating from its current AQR to any other status within the time horizon. Transition rates are measured using Old National&#8217;s own historical experience. The model assumes that recent historical transition rates will continue into the future. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. The sum of all net charge-offs for a particular portfolio segment are divided by all loans that have defaulted over a given period of time. The expected loss derived from the model considers the PD, LGD, and exposure at default. Additionally, qualitative factors, such as changes in lending policies or procedures, and economic business conditions are also considered. 

We use h istoric loss ratios adjusted for economic conditions to determine the appropriate level of allowance for residential real estate and consumer loans. 

No allowance was brought forward on any of the acquired loans as any credit deterioration evident in the loans was included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date. An allowance for loan losses will be established for any subsequent credit deterioration or adverse changes in expected cash flows.

Old National&#8217;s activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was as follows:

Credit Quality

Old National&#8217;s management monitors the credit quality of its loans in an on-going manner. Internally, management assigns an AQR to each non-homogeneous commercial and commercial real estate loan in the portfolio, with the exception of certain FICO-scored small business loans. The primary determinants of the AQR are based upon the reliability of the primary source of repayment and the past, present, and projected financial condition of the borrower. The AQR will also consider current industry conditions. Major factors used in determining the AQR can vary based on the nature of the loan, but commonly include factors such as debt service coverage, internal cash flow, liquidity, leverage, operating performance, debt burden, FICO scores, occupancy, interest rate sensitivity, and expense burden. Old National uses the following definitions for risk ratings:

Criticized . Special mention loans that have a potential weakness that deserves management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution&#8217;s credit position at some future date. 

Classified &#8211; Substandard . Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Classified &#8211; Nonaccrual . Loans classified as nonaccrual have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, in doubt. 

&#160;

Classified &#8211; Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as nonaccrual, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable . 

Pass rated loans are those loans that are other than criticized, classified &#8211; substandard, classified &#8211; nonaccrual, or classified &#8211; doubtful.

The risk category of commercial and commercial real estate loans by class of loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:

&#160;

Impaired Loans

Large commercial credits are subject to individual evaluation for impairment. Retail credits and other small balance credits that are part of a homogeneous group are not tested for individual impairment unless they are modified as a TDR. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated cash flows using the loan&#8217;s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Old National&#8217;s policy, for all but PCI loans, is to recognize interest income on impaired loans unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.

&#160;

The following table shows Old National&#8217;s impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Only purchased loans that have experienced subsequent impairment since the date acquired (excluding loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality) are included in the table below.

Old National does not record interest on nonaccrual loans until principal is recovered. Interest income recognized on impaired loans during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was immaterial.

&#160;

For all loan classes, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. Interest accrued during the current year on such loans is reversed against interest income. Interest accrued in the prior year, if any, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Cash interest received on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the principal is recovered or until the loan returns to accrual status. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, remain current for a prescribed period, and future payments are reasonably assured.

Loans accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 accrue interest, even though they may be contractually past due, as any nonpayment of contractual principal or interest is considered in the periodic re-estimation of expected cash flows and is included in the resulting recognition of current period loan loss provision or prospective yield adjustments.

Old National&#8217;s past due loans as of December 31 were as follows:

##TABLE_START (1) 

Includes purchased credit impaired loans of $ 7.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 20.5 million at December 31, 2018 that are categorized as nonaccrual for credit analysis purposes because the collection of principal or interest is doubtful. However, these loans are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30 and accordingly treated as performing assets.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Loan Participations

Old National has loan participations, which qualify as participating interests, with other financial institutions. At December 31, 2019, these loans totaled $ 868.1 million, of which $ 405.2 million had been sold to other financial institutions and $ 462.9 million was retained by Old National. The loan participations convey proportionate ownership rights with equal priority to each participating interest holder&#59; involve no recourse (other than ordinary representations and warranties) to, or subordination by, any participating interest holder&#59; all cash flows are divided among the participating interest holders in proportion to each holder&#8217;s share of ownership&#59; and no holder has the right to pledge the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree.

&#160;

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Old National may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit Old National by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.

Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a TDR has occurred, which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, Old National Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk, or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan.

Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months .

If we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue, the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss. For large commercial type loans, each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances. Generally, Old National charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under $ 250,000 that are 90 days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support. For residential and consumer loans, a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes 120 to 180 days past due, whichever is earlier.

For commercial TDRs, an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value. To determine the value of the loan, one of the following methods is selected: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, (2) the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or (3) the fair value of the collateral value, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value. If there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly.

When a residential or consumer loan is identified as a TDR, the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs.

&#160;

The following table presents activity in TDRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:

The TDRs that occurred during 2019 increased the allowance for loan losses by $ 2.0 million and resulted in $ 3.9 million in charge-offs during 2019. The TDRs that occurred during 2018 did no t have a material impact on the allowance for loan losses and resulted in no charge-offs during 2018. The TDRs that occurred during 2017 increased the allowance for loan losses by $ 2.7 million and resulted in $ 0.2 million of charge-offs during 2017.

A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.

TDRs for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the year were insignificant in 2019, 2018, and 2017.

The terms of certain other loans were modified during 2019 and 2018 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. It is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that, during the period, have been renewed, have entered into a forbearance agreement, have gone from principal and interest to interest only, or have extended the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. We also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate, additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee. We also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment.

PCI loans are not considered impaired until after the point at which there has been a degradation of cash flows below our expected cash flows at acquisition. If a PCI loan is subsequently modified, and meets the definition of a TDR, it will be removed from PCI accounting and accounted for as a TDR only if the PCI loan was being accounted for individually. If the PCI loan is being accounted for as part of a pool, it will not be removed from the pool. As of December 31, 2019, it has not been necessary to remove any loans from PCI accounting.

&#160;

In general, once a modified loan is considered a TDR , the loan will always be considered a TDR , and therefore impaired, until it is paid in full, otherwise settled, sold , or charged off. However, guidance also permits for loans to be removed from TDR status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances: (1) at the time of the subsequent restructuring, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring, (2) under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement, the institution has granted no concession to the borrower&#59; and (3) the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan. For loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness, the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables &#8211; Overall . However, consistent with ASC 310-40-50-2, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, Creditor Disclosure of Troubled Debt Restructurings , the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria: (1) has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate&#59; and (2) is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring . 

Purchased Credit Impaired Loans

Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date with no carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses. In determining the estimated fair value of purchased loans, management considers a number of factors including, among others, the remaining life of the acquired loans, estimated prepayments, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and net present value of cash flows expected to be received. Purchased loans are accounted for in accordance with guidance for certain loans acquired in a transfer (ASC 310-30), when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the acquirer will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan and lease losses. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows will result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and then an adjustment to accretable yield, which would have a positive impact on interest income prospectively.

Old National has purchased loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. The carrying amount of those loans was as follows:

The outstanding balance of loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, including contractual principal, interest, fees and penalties, was $ 223.3 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 246.9 million at December 31, 2018.

The accretable difference on PCI loans is the difference between the expected cash flows and the net present value of expected cash flows with such difference accreted into earnings using the effective yield method over the term of the loans. Accretion recorded as loan interest income totaled $ 11.3 million during 2019 and $ 12.3 million during 2018. Improvement in cash flow expectations has resulted in a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield as shown in the table below.

&#160;

Accretable yield of PCI loans, or income expected to be collected, was as follows:

Finance Leases

Old National leases certain branch buildings under finance leases that are included in premises and equipment. See Notes 8 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for detail regarding these leases.

NOTE 8 &#8211; LEASES

&#160;

Old National adopted FASB Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements regarding transition guidance related to the new standard.

&#160;

Old National determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment and other borrowings in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

&#160;

Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the implicit lease rate when readily determinable. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.

&#160;

Old National has operating and finance leases for land, office space, banking centers, and equipment. These leases are generally for periods of 10 to 20 years with various renewal options. We include certain renewal options in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities if they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or a rate are initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date and are included in the measurement of the lease liability. Variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or a rate are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in profit and loss. Variable lease payments are defined as payments made for the right to use an asset that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. 

&#160;

We have made a policy election to exclude the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to all classes of leases with original terms of 12 months or less. Instead, the short-term lease payments are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

&#160;

Old National has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate leases, non-lease components and other non-components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, and insurance are not included in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally segregated. For certain equipment leases, Old National accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component using the practical expedient available for that class of assets.

&#160;

&#160;

Old National does not have any material sub-lease agreements.

&#160;

The components of lease expense were as follows:

Senior Notes

In August 2014, Old National issued $ 175.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.125 % interest rate. These notes pay interest on February 15 and August 15. The notes mature on August 15, 2024 .

Junior Subordinated Debentures

Junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities are classified in &#8220;other borrowings.&#8221; On November 1, 2017, Old National acquired Anchor (MN) and exceeded $15 billion in assets. As a result, these securities can only be treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, subject to certain limitations. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, these securities qualified as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes.

Through various acquisitions, Old National assumed junior subordinated debenture obligations related to various trusts that issued trust preferred securities. Old National guarantees the payment of distributions on the trust preferred securities issued by the trusts. Proceeds from the issuance of each of these securities were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures with the same financial terms as the securities issued by the trusts.

Old National, at any time, may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at par and, thereby cause a redemption of the trust preferred securities in whole or in part. In December 2019, Old National redeemed at par $ 8.0 million of junior subordinated debentures issued in December 2005 by Tower Financial Corporation, which was acquired by Old National in 2014. This subsequently caused the redemption of all of the common and capital (preferred) securities issued by Tower Capital Trust 2 by the same amount in aggregate. At the time of redemption, the rate on this floating rate instrument was 3.44 %.

Subordinated Debentures

On November 1, 2017, Old National assumed $ 12.0 million of subordinated fixed-to-floating notes related to the acquisition of Anchor (MN). The subordinated debentures have a 5.75 % fixed rate of interest through October 29, 2020 . From October 30, 2020 to the October 30, 2025 maturity date, the debentures have a floating rate of interest equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 4.356 % .

Finance Lease Obligations

Old National has long-term finance lease liabilities for certain banking centers totaling $ 7.4 million. The economic substance of these leases is that Old National is financing the acquisition of the building through the lease and accordingly, the building is recorded as a right-of-use asset in premises and equipment and the lease is recorded as a liability in other borrowings. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using Old National&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a maturity analysis of the Company&#8217;s finance lease liabilities.

The statutory rate in effect was 21 % for 2019 and 2018, compared to 35 % for 2017.

&#160;

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The higher effective tax rate in 2019 when compared to 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in federal tax credits available as well as an increase in pre-tax book income. 

&#160;

The lower effective tax rate in 2018 when compared to 2017 was primarily the result of the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in 2018 and an increase in federal tax credits available. Old National recorded $ 39.3 million of additional tax expense in 2017 due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets reflecting the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to 21 %. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;H.R. 1&#8221;) was enacted into legislation. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.

&#160;

Shortly after the enactment date, the SEC issued SAB 118, which addresses the situations where the accounting for changes in tax laws is complete, incomplete but can be reasonably estimated, and incomplete and cannot be reasonably estimated. SAB 118 also permits a measurement period of up to one year from the date of enactment to refine the provisional accounting. Old National completed its analysis of H.R. 1 during the second quarter of 2018 and there were immaterial adjustments made to the revaluation of Old National&#8217;s deferred tax assets . 

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following components for the years ended December 31:

Through the acquisition of Anchor (WI) in the second quarter of 2016 and Lafayette Savings Bank in the fourth quarter of 2014, both former thrifts, Old National Bank&#8217;s retained earnings at December 31, 2019 include base-year bad debt reserves, created for tax purposes prior to 1988, totaling $ 52.8 million. Of this total, $ 50.9 million was acquired from Anchor (WI), and $ 1.9 million was acquired from Lafayette Savings Bank. Base-year reserves are 

&#160;

subject to recapture in the unlikely event that Old National Bank (1) makes distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, (2) redeems its stock, or (3) liquidates. Old National Bank has no intention of making such a nondividend distribution. Accordingly, under current accounting principles, a related deferred income tax liability of $ 13.0 million has not been recognized. 

No valuation allowance was recorded at December 31, 2019 or 2018 because, based on current expectations, Old National believes it will generate sufficient income in future years to realize deferred tax assets. Old National has federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 78.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 104.5 million at December 31, 2018. This federal net operating loss was acquired from the acquisition of Anchor (WI) in 2016. If not used, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire from 2029 to 2033 . Old National has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards totaling $ 1.3 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 10.1 million at December 31, 2018. The enactment of H.R.1 eliminates the parallel tax system known as the alternative minimum tax and allows any existing alternative minimum tax credits to be used to reduce regular tax or be refunded from 2018 to 2021. ASC 740 allows for the reclassification of the alternative minimum tax credit from a deferred tax asset to a current tax asset, except for the amount limited by section 382. Old National has $ 1.3 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforward subject to section 382 limitations, which is included in deferred tax assets. Old National has recorded state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 148.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 165.6 million at December 31, 2018. If not used, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire from 2024 to 2033 . Old National had federal tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.8 million at December 31, 2018.

The federal and recorded state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 382. Old National believes that all of the recorded net operating loss carryforwards will be used prior to expiration.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

Old National has an immaterial amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Old National expects the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced to zero after the Internal Revenue Service audit is finalized.

Old National and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as filing various state returns. The 2016 through 2019 tax years are open and subject to examination. Old National is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.

NOTE 18 &#8211; EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

The Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan (the &#8220;401(k) Plan&#8221;) permits employees to participate the first month following one month of service. Effective as of April 1, 2010, we suspended safe harbor matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan. However, we may make discretionary matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan. During the second quarter of 2018, Old National increased its match to 75 % of employee compensation deferral contributions of the first 4 % of compensation, and 50 % of the next 4 % of compensation. The change was retroactive for all of 2018. For 2017, we matched 50 % of employee compensation deferral contributions, up to 6 % of compensation. In addition to matching contributions, Old National may contribute to the 401(k) Plan an amount designated as a profit sharing contribution in the form of Old National stock or cash. Our Board of Directors designated no discretionary profit sharing contributions in 2019, 2018, or 2017. All contributions vest immediately and plan participants may elect to redirect funds among any of the investment options provided under the 401(k) Plan. The number of Old National shares in the 401(k) Plan were 0.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 0.7 million at December 31, 2018. All shares owned through the 401(k) Plan are included in the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted and basic earnings per share. Contribution expense under the 401(k) Plan was $ 9.8 million in 2019, $ 8.6 million in 2018, and $ 4.7 million in 2017.

NOTE 19 &#8211; SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Our Amended and Restated 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#8220;ICP&#8221;), which was shareholder-approved, permits the grant of share-based awards to its employees. At December 31, 2019, 3.7 million shares were available for issuance. The granting of awards to key employees is typically in the form of restricted stock awards or units. We believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders. Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for the ICP was $ 8.0 million in 2019, $ 8.1 million in 2018, 

&#160;

and $ 6.3 million in 201 7 . The total income tax benefit was $ 2.0 million in 201 9 , $ 2.0 million in 201 8 , and $ 2.4 million in 201 7 . 

Restricted Stock Awards

Restricted stock awards require certain service requirements and commonly have vesting periods of 3 years. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Shares are subject to certain restrictions and risk of forfeiture by the participants.

Stock Options

Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant&#59; these option awards have vesting periods ranging from 3 to 5 years and have 10 -year contractual terms.

Old National has not granted stock options since 2009. However, Old National did acquire stock options and stock appreciation rights through prior year acquisitions. Old National recorded no incremental expense associated with the conversion of these options and stock appreciation rights.

Outside Director Stock Compensation Program

Old National maintains a director stock compensation program covering all outside directors. Compensation shares are earned semi-annually. Beginning in 2017, any shares awarded to directors are anticipated to be issued from the ICP. In 2019, 12 thousand shares were issued to directors, compared to 16 thousand shares in 2018, and 20 thousand shares in 2017.

NOTE 20 &#8211; SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

Old National has a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan under which common shares issued may be either repurchased shares or authorized and previously unissued shares. A new plan became effective on August 13, 2018, with total authorized and unissued common shares reserved for issuance of 3.3 million. At December 31, 2019, 3.3 million authorized and unissued common shares were available for issuance under the plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Old National has an employee stock purchase plan under which eligible employees can purchase common shares at a price not less than 95 % of the fair market value of the common shares on the purchase date. The amount of common shares purchased cannot exceed 10 % of the employee&#8217;s compensation. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased under this plan is 500,000 shares. In 2019, 36,000 shares were issued related to this plan with proceeds of approximately $ 567,000 . In 2018, 29,000 shares were issued related to this plan with proceeds of approximately $ 497,000 .

Share Repurchase Plan

In the first quarter of 2019, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 7.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common shares to be repurchased, as conditions warrant, through January 31, 2020 . During 2019, Old National repurchased 6.0 million common shares under the plan, which reduced equity by $ 99.1 million.

On January 15, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stock repurchase plan that authorizes up to 7.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common shares to be repurchased, as conditions warrant, through January 31, 2021 .

&#160;

Net Income per Share

Basic and diluted net income per share are calculated using the two-class method. Net income is divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Adjustments to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute net income per common share. Net income is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents during the period.

The following table reconciles basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31.

Options to purchase 14 thousand shares, 14 thousand shares, and 0.1 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of net income per diluted share because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 21 &#8211; FAIR VALUE

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.

&#8226; 

Level 2 &#8211; Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities&#59; quoted prices in markets that are not active&#59; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Level 3 &#8211; Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Old National used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 

Investment securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Discounted cash flows are calculated using swap and LIBOR curves plus spreads that adjust for loss severities, volatility, credit risk, and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations.

Residential loans held for sale : The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan (Level 2).

Derivative financial instruments : The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on derivative valuation models using market data inputs as of the valuation date (Level 2).

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including financial assets and liabilities for which we have elected the fair value option, are summarized below:

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The accretion or amortization of discounts on securities in the table above is included in interest income. An increase in fair value is reflected in the balance sheet as an increase in the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in shareholders&#8217; equity, and a decrease in other assets related to the tax impact. A decrease in fair value is reflected in the balance sheet as a decrease in the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in shareholders&#8217; equity, and an increase in other assets related to the tax impact. During 2019, Old National received third party pricing on a $ 4.0 million state and political subdivisions security and transferred it out of Level 3. Old National transferred $ 4.1 million of state and political subdivisions securities to Level 3 during 2018 because Old National could no longer obtain evidence of observable inputs.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ( 1 ) 

Assuming no prepayments.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ( 2 ) 

Each currently performing pool asset is assigned a default probability based on the banking environment, which is adjusted for specific issuer evaluation, of 0 %, 50 %, or 100 %.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ( 3 ) 

Each currently defaulted pool asset is assigned a recovery probability based on specific issuer evaluation of 0 %, 25 %, or 100 %.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Significant changes in any of the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement in isolation would result in a significant change to the fair value measurement. The pooled trust preferred securities Old National owns are subordinate note classes that rely on an ongoing cash flow stream to support their values. The senior note classes receive the benefit of prepayments to the detriment of subordinate note classes since the ongoing interest cash flow stream is reduced by the early redemption. Generally, a change in prepayment rates or additional pool asset defaults has an impact that is directionally opposite from a change in the expected recovery of a defaulted pool asset.

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2019 are summarized below:

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans that are deemed collateral dependent are valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. These estimates are based on the most recently available appraisals with certain adjustments made based on the type of property, age of appraisal, current status of the property, and other related factors to estimate the current value of the collateral. These impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans had a principal amount of $ 30.9 million, with a valuation allowance of $ 8.9 million at December 31, 2019. Old National recorded provision expense associated with these loans totaling $ 4.1 million in 2019.

Other real estate owned and other repossessed property is measured at fair value less costs to sell and had a net carrying amount of $ 43 thousand at December 31, 2019. The estimates of fair value are based on the most recently available appraisals with certain adjustments made based on the type of property, age of appraisal, current status of 

&#160;

the property, and other related factors to estimate the current value of the collateral . There were write-downs of other real estate owned of $ 60 thousand in 201 9 . 

Loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an individual tranche exceeds fair value, impairment is recorded on that tranche so that the servicing asset is carried at fair value. Fair value is determined at a tranche level, based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model utilizes a discount rate, weighted average prepayment speed, and other economic factors that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and that can be validated against available market data (Level 2). The valuation allowance for loan servicing rights with impairments at December 31, 2019 totaled $ 31 thousand. Old National recorded impairments associated with these loan servicing rights totaling $ 16 thousand in 2019.

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2018 are summarized below:

There was only one collateral dependent impaired commercial real estate loan, one foreclosed commercial real estate asset, and one foreclosed residential asset at December 31, 2019, so no range or weighted average is reported.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Financial instruments recorded using fair value option 

Old National may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in net income. After the initial adoption, the election is made at the acquisition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability, or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made.

Residential loans held for sale 

Old National has elected the fair value option for residential loans held for sale. For these loans, interest income is recorded in the consolidated statements of income based on the contractual amount of interest income earned on the financial assets (except any that are on nonaccrual status). None of these loans are 90 days or more past due, nor are any on nonaccrual status. Included in the income statement is interest income for loans held for sale totaling $ 1.4 million in 2019, $ 0.5 million in 2018, and $ 0.2 million in 2017.

Old National has elected the fair value option for newly originated conforming fixed-rate and adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held for sale. These loans are intended for sale and are hedged with derivative instruments. Old National has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplification. The fair value option was not elected for loans held for investment.

The difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining principal balance for loans for which the fair value option has been elected as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:

The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 represent an approximation of exit price, however, an actual exit price may differ.

NOTE 22 &#8211; DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As part of our overall interest rate risk management, Old National uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, collars, caps, and floors. The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual agreements. The notional amount of these derivative instruments was $ 665.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 1.482 billion at December 31, 2018. These derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2019 consisted of $ 130.5 million notional amount of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its FHLB advances, $ 25.0 million notional amount of pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its FHLB advances, and $ 510.0 million notional amount interest rate collars and floors related to variable-rate commercial loan pools. Derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2018 consisted of $ 757.0 million notional amount of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its FHLB advances, $ 525.0 million notional amount of pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its FHLB advances, and $ 200.0 million notional amount interest rate collars related to a variable-rate commercial loan pool. These hedges were entered into to manage interest rate risk. Derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and are not reported on a net basis.

In accordance with ASC 815-20-35-1, subsequent changes in fair value for a hedging instrument that has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship should be accounted for in the following manner:

Cash flow hedges : changes in fair value are recognized as a component in other comprehensive income. 

Fair value hedges : changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings. 

&#160;

Consistent with this guidance, as long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, 100 % of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument will be accounted for as outlined above. This is the case whether or not economic mismatches exist in the hedging relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge gains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings. 

While separate measurement and presentation of ineffectiveness is eliminated, paragraph 815-20-45-1A requires the change in fair value of the hedging instrument that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness be presented in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item.

C ommitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate lock commitments) and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors are considered derivatives. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. At December 31, 2019, the notional amount of the interest rate lock commitments was $ 65.7 million and forward commitments were $ 101.6 million. At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of the interest rate lock commitments was $ 27.6 million and forward commitments were $ 34.5 million. It is our practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans to third party investors when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from our commitment to fund the loans. 

Old National also enters into derivative instruments for the benefit of its customers. The notional amounts of these customer derivative instruments and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $ 1.298 billion at December 31 , 2019. The notional amounts of these customer derivative instruments and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $ 793.4 million at December 31 , 2018. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include interest rate swaps, caps, and collars. &#160; Commonly, Old National will economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms.

Old National enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency risk management strategies. These derivative instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. Old National does not designate these foreign currency forward contracts for hedge accounting treatment. The notional amounts of these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $ 8.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 3.6 million at December 31, 2018.

Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. Old National&#8217;s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal, or contract amounts. There are provisions in our agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, we minimize credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.

Amounts reported in AOCI related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified to interest income or interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on Old National&#8217;s derivative instruments. During the next 12 months, we estimate that $ 1.0 million will be reclassified to interest income and $ 0.7 million will be reclassified to interest expense.

&#160;

During 2019, Old National terminated seven fair value hedges in order to mitigate potential adverse changes in the fair values of fixed-rate debt attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged. The aggregate notional amount of the hedging instruments and hedged items was $ 825.0 million. The unamortized basis adjustments related to these terminations was $ 20.5 million at December 31, 2019.

NOTE 23 &#8211; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

In the normal course of business, Old National Bancorp and its subsidiaries have been named, from time to time, as defendants in various legal actions. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.

Old National contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, Old National cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, Old National believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Old National, although the outcome of such matters could be material to Old National&#8217;s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, the level of Old National&#8217;s revenues or income for such period. Old National will accrue for a loss contingency if (1) it is probable that a future event will occur and confirm the loss and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Old National is not currently involved in any material litigation.

Credit-Related Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, Old National&#8217;s banking affiliates have entered into various agreements to extend credit, including loan commitments of $ 2.779 billion and standby letters of credit of $ 87.8 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, approximately $ 2.545 billion of the loan commitments had fixed rates and $ 234.5 million had floating rates, with the floating interest rates ranging from 1 % to 15 %. At December 31, 2018, loan commitments totaled $ 3.566 billion and standby letters of credit totaled $ 319.0 million. These commitments are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments totaled $ 2.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 2.5 million at December 31, 2018.

Old National had credit extensions with various unaffiliated banks related to letter of credit commitments issued on behalf of Old National&#8217;s clients totaling $ 8.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 15.5 million at December 31, 2018. Old National provided collateral to the unaffiliated banks to secure credit extensions totaling $ 7.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 7.8 million December 31, 2018. Old National did not provide collateral for the remaining credit extensions.

Visa Class B Restricted Shares

In 2008, Old National received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa&#8217;s initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A common shares. This conversion will not occur until the final settlement of certain litigation for which Visa is indemnified by the holders of Visa&#8217;s Class B shares, including Old National. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Increases in litigation claims requiring Visa to fund the 

&#160;

escrow account due to insufficient funds will result in a reduction of the conversion ratio of each Visa Class B share to unrestricted Class A shares . As of December 31, 201 9 , the conversion ratio was 1.6228 . Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation, the 65,466 Class B shares that Old National owns at December 31, 201 9 are carried at a zero cost basis and are included in other assets with our equity securities that have no readily determinable fair value . 

NOTE 24 &#8211; FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

Old National holds instruments, in the normal course of business with clients, that are considered financial guarantees in accordance with FASB ASC 460-10 (FIN 45, Guarantor&#8217;s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ) , which requires Old National to record the instruments at fair value. Standby letters of credit guarantees are issued in connection with agreements made by clients to counterparties. Standby letters of credit are contingent upon failure of the client to perform the terms of the underlying contract. Credit risk associated with standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that associated with extending loans to clients and is subject to normal credit policies. The term of these standby letters of credit is typically one year or less. At December 31, 2019, the notional amount of standby letters of credit was $ 87.8 million, which represented the maximum amount of future funding requirements, and the carrying value was $ 0.6 million. At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of standby letters of credit was $ 319.0 million, which represented the maximum amount of future funding requirements, and the carrying value was $ 0.5 million.

Old National is a party in risk participation transactions of interest rate swaps, which had total notional amount of $ 37.0 million at December 31, 2019.

&#160;

NOTE 25 &#8211; REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

&#160;

Old National&#8217;s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within noninterest income. The consolidated statements of income include all categories of noninterest income. The following table reflects only the categories of noninterest income that are within the scope of Topic 606:

&#160;

Wealth management fees : Old National earns wealth management fees based upon asset custody and investment management services provided to individual and institutional customers. Most of these customers receive monthly or quarterly billings for services rendered based upon the market value of assets in custody. Fees that are transaction based are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed.

&#160;

Service charges on deposit accounts : Old National earns fees from deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees and overdraft fees are recognized at a point in time, since the customer generally has a right to cancel the depository arrangement at any time. The arrangement is considered a day-to-day contract with ongoing renewals and optional purchases, so the duration of the contract does not extend beyond the services already performed. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which Old National satisfies its performance obligation.

&#160;

Debit card and ATM fees : Debit card and ATM fees include ATM usage fees and debit card interchange income. As with the transaction-based fees on deposit accounts, the ATM fees are recognized at the point in time that Old National fulfills the customer&#8217;s request. Old National earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions processed 

&#160;

through card association networks. Interchange rates are generally set by the card associations based upon purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. 

&#160;

Investment product fees : Investment product fees are the commissions and fees received from a registered broker/dealer and investment adviser that provide those services to Old National customers. Old National acts as an agent in arranging the relationship between the customer and the third-party service provider. These fees are recognized monthly from the third-party broker based upon services already performed, net of the processing fees charged to Old National by the broker.

NOTE 26 &#8211; REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks

Old National&#8217;s affiliate bank is required to maintain reserve balances on hand and with the Federal Reserve Bank that are interest-bearing and unavailable for investment purposes. The reserve balances were $ 115.3 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 108.1 million at December 31, 2018. In addition, Old National had cash and due from banks which was held as collateral for collateralized swap positions of $ 6.9 million at December 31, 2019. Old National did no t have any cash and due from banks held as collateral for collateralized swap positions at December 31, 2018.

Restrictions on Transfers from Affiliate Bank

Regulations limit the amount of dividends an affiliate bank can declare in any year without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years . Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2017, 2018, or 2019 and is not currently required.

Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends

Old National has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on Old National&#8217;s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.

Capital Adequacy

Old National and Old National Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Old National&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Old National and Old National Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Old National and Old National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the following tables.

At December 31, 2019, Old National and Old National Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of well-capitalized based on the most recent regulatory notification. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Old National Bank&#8217;s category.

&#160;

The following table summarizes capital ratios for Old National and Old National Bank as of December 31:

As of January 1, 2019, Basel III Capital Rules required banking organizations to maintain: a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 %, plus a 2.5 % &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;&#59; a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 %, plus the 2.5 % capital conservation buffer&#59; a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 %, plus the 2.5 % capital conservation buffer&#59; and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets of at least 4.0 %.

&#160;

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. Old National is planning on adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible three-year period.

NOTE 28 &#8211; SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Old National Bank, Old National&#8217;s bank subsidiary, is the only significant subsidiary upon which management makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Each of the branches of Old National Bank provide a group of similar community banking services, including such products and services as commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, cash management, brokerage, trust, and investment advisory services. The individual bank branches located throughout our Midwest footprint have similar operating and economic characteristics. While the chief decision maker monitors the revenue streams of the various products, services, and regional locations, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the community banking services and branch locations are considered by management to be aggregated into one reportable operating segment, community banking.

&#160;
