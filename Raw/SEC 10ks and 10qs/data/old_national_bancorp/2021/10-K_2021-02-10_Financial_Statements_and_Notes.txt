REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include some amounts which are estimates based upon currently available information and management&#8217;s judgment of current conditions and circumstances. Financial information throughout this annual report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements. 

Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls which is believed to provide, in all material respects, reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized and recorded, and the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. In addition, Old National has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a Senior Financial and Executive Officer Code of Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines that outline high levels of ethical business standards. Old National has also appointed a Chief Ethics Officer and had a third party perform an independent validation of our ethics program. All systems of internal accounting controls are based on management&#8217;s judgment that the cost of controls should not exceed the benefits to be achieved and that no system can provide absolute assurance that control objectives are achieved. Management believes Old National&#8217;s system provides the appropriate balance between cost of controls and the related benefits. 

In order to monitor compliance with this system of controls, Old National maintains an extensive internal audit program. Internal audit reports are issued to appropriate officers and significant audit exceptions, if any, are reviewed with management and the Audit Committee. 

The Board of Directors, through an Audit Committee comprised solely of independent outside directors, oversees management&#8217;s discharge of its financial reporting responsibilities. The Audit Committee meets regularly with Old National&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, Crowe LLP, and the managers of financial reporting, internal audit, and risk. During these meetings, the committee meets privately with the independent registered public accounting firm as well as with financial reporting and internal audit personnel to review accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is made by the Audit Committee. 

The consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K have been audited by Crowe LLP, for the purpose of determining that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Crowe LLP&#8217;s report on the financial statements follows. 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

The management of Old National is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Old National&#8217;s management assessed the effectiveness of Old National&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework . Based on that assessment Old National has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, Old National&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Old National&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of Old National&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 as stated in their report which follows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Old National Bancorp 

Evansville, Indiana 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Old National Bancorp (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (ASC 326). The Company adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified retrospective method such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles. The adoption of the new credit loss standard and its subsequent application is also communicated as a critical audit matter below. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 

respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. 

Allowance for Credit Losses and Provision Expense 

In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (the &#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 326 as of January 1, 2020 as described in Notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements using the modified retrospective method. See also the explanatory paragraph above. The allowance for credit losses (the &#8220;ACL&#8221;) is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of financial assets carried at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets), including the Company's loan portfolio, measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Estimates of expected credit losses for loans are based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts over the expected life of the loans. In order to estimate the expected credit losses, the Company implemented several new loss estimation models. The Company disclosed the impact of adoption of this standard on January 1, 2020 with a $41.3 million increase to the allowance for credit losses, a $4.5 million increase for unfunded loan commitments and a $31.1 million decrease to retained earnings for the cumulative effect adjustment recorded upon adoption. Provision expense for the year ending December 31, 2020 was $38.4 million and the Allowance for Credit Losses at December 31, 2020 was $131.4 million. 

The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) approach with probability of default (&#8220;PD&#8221;) methodology. The PD regression models use combinations of variables to assess risk including unsystematic risk to help gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower and variables for systematic risk applicable to all borrowers. Other assumptions used to determine the quantitative 

allowance include the loss given default (LGD), which is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults, and prepayment assumptions. Expected cashflows are created for each loan using reasonable and supportable forecasts and discounted using the loan&#8217;s effective yield. The discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as a component of the ACL. Qualitative adjustments are applied to the quantitative component to adjust for factors such as current conditions. 

The Allowance for Credit Losses was identified by us as a critical audit matter because of the extent of auditor judgment applied and significant audit effort to evaluate the significant subjective and complex judgments made by management throughout the initial adoption and subsequent application processes, including the need to involve our valuation services specialists. The principal considerations resulting in our determination included the following: 

&#8226; Significant auditor judgment and audit effort to evaluate the appropriateness of selection of the loss estimation models and PD regression models, appropriateness of loan segmentation, and the reasonableness of PD and LGD assumptions. 

&#8226; Significant auditor judgment in evaluating the selection and application of the reasonable and supportable forecast of economic variables. 

&#8226; Significant auditor judgement and effort were used in evaluating the qualitative factors used in the calculation. 

&#8226; Significant audit effort related to the completeness and accuracy of the high volume of data used to develop assumptions and in the model computation 

The primary procedures performed to address the critical audit matter included: 

&#8226; Testing the effectiveness of management&#8217;s internal controls over the Company&#8217;s significant model assumptions and judgments, loan segmentation, reasonable and supportable forecasts, qualitative factor adjustments, information systems and model validation 

&#8226; Testing the effectiveness of controls over the completeness and accuracy of historical inputs used in the development of the PD models and LGD assumptions, data imputation, use of third-party data, and loan data used in the computation 

&#8226; Testing the effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s preparation and review of the allowance for credit loss calculation, including data used as the basis for adjustments related to the qualitative factors, the development and reasonableness of qualitative factors and mathematical accuracy and appropriateness of the overall calculation; 

&#8226; With the assistance of our valuation specialists, evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions and judgments related to the PD, LGD and loan segmentation, the conceptual design of the credit loss estimation models, model assumption sensitivity analysis and the adequacy of the independent model validation 

&#8226; Evaluating management&#8217;s judgments in the selection and application of reasonable and supportable forecast of economic variables 

&#8226; Substantively testing management&#8217;s process for developing the qualitative factors and assessing reasonableness, relevance and reliability of data used to develop factors, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions for reasonableness. 

&#8226; Substantively testing the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow model at a loan level with the assistance of valuation services, including the completeness and accuracy of loan data used in the model.

OLD NATIONAL BANCORP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Old National Bancorp, a financial holding company headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, operates primarily in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Its principal subsidiary is Old National Bank. Through its bank and non-bank affiliates, Old National Bancorp provides to its clients an array of financial services including loan, deposit, wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. 

NOTE 1 &#8211; BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Old National Bancorp and its wholly-owned affiliates (hereinafter collectively referred to as &#8220;Old National&#8221;) and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry. Such principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or shareholders&#8217; equity and were insignificant amounts. 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities consist of mutual funds held in trusts associated with deferred compensation plans for former directors and executives. These mutual funds are recorded as equity securities at fair value. Gains and losses are included in other income in 2020 and 2019 and net securities gains in 2018. 

Investment Securities 

Old National classified all of its debt investment securities as available-for-sale at December 31, 2020. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax effect, recorded in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses affect income and the prior fair value adjustments are reclassified within shareholders&#8217; equity. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, Old National also had debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, which management had the intent and ability to hold to maturity, were reported at amortized cost. Interest income included amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts were amortized on the level-yield method. Anticipated prepayments were considered when amortizing premiums and discounts on mortgage backed securities. Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities are determined using the specific-identification method. 

Available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. For available-for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

Old National is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans that Old National has originated with an intent to sell are classified as loans held for sale and are recorded at fair value, determined individually, as of the balance sheet date. The loan&#8217;s fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest. Conventional mortgage production is sold on a servicing retained basis. Certain loans, such as government guaranteed mortgage loans are sold on servicing released basis. Mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were $ 63.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $ 46.9 million at December 31, 2019. 

Loans 

Loans that Old National intends to hold for investment purposes are classified as portfolio loans. Portfolio loans are carried at the principal balance outstanding, net of earned interest, purchase premiums or discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the principal balances of loans outstanding. For all loan classes, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. Interest accrued but not received is reversed against earnings. Cash interest received on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the principal is recovered or until the loan returns to accrual status. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, remain current for a prescribed period, and future payments are reasonably assured. 

Old National has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan&#8217;s purchase price and initial allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is accreted or amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. We have made a policy election to report accrued interest receivable as a separate line item on the balance sheet. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of the loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

We utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans. Expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield. The discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as reserve. Expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules, calculated PDs, LGD, and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors. For the commercial and commercial real estate loans, the PD is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon. For residential and consumer loans, the PD is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being charged-off within the time horizon. The regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk. Variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower. Variables for systematic risk, risk inherent to all borrowers, come from the use of forward-looking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and house price index. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts. 

Further information regarding Old National&#8217;s policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses for loans is presented in Note 3. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is stated at cost. Depreciation is charged to operating expense over the useful lives of the assets, principally on the straight-line method. Useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows: buildings and building improvements &#8211; 15 to 39 years; and furniture and equipment &#8211; 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major additions and improvements are capitalized. Interest costs on construction of qualifying assets are capitalized. 

Premises and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are adjusted to fair value. Such impairments are included in other expense. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets is not recorded. However, the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. Other intangible assets, including core deposits and customer business relationships, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, generally over a period of 5 to 15 years. 

Company-Owned Life Insurance 

Old National has purchased, as well as obtained through acquisitions, life insurance policies on certain key executives. Old National records company-owned life insurance at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. 

Loan Servicing Rights 

When loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gain on sales of loans. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the 

amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Loan servicing rights are included in other assets on the balance sheet. 

Loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, term, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If Old National later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with mortgage banking revenue on the income statement. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement as mortgage banking revenue, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

As part of Old National&#8217;s overall interest rate risk management, Old National uses derivative instruments, including TBA forward agreements and interest rate swaps, collars, caps, and floors. All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. At the inception of the derivative contract, Old National designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (&#8220;fair value hedge&#8221;), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (&#8220;cash flow hedge&#8221;), or (3) an instrument with no hedging designation (&#8220;stand-alone derivative&#8221;). For a fair value hedge, the change in value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting change in value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported currently in earnings, in noninterest income. 

Net cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in noninterest income. 

Old National formally documents all relationships between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This documentation includes linking fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Old National also formally assesses, both at the hedge&#8217;s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Old National discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that (1) the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, or terminated; (3) the derivative instrument is de-designated as a hedge because the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring; (4) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or (5) management otherwise determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 

When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized or accreted over the remaining life of the asset or liability. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transaction is still expected to occur, changes in value that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized or accreted into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. 

Old National enters into various stand-alone mortgage-banking derivatives in order to hedge the risk associated with the fluctuation of interest rates. Changes in fair value are recorded as mortgage banking revenue. Old National also enters into various stand-alone derivative contracts to provide derivative products to customers which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as other noninterest income. 

Old National is exposed to losses if a counterparty fails to make its payments under a contract in which Old National is in the net receiving position. Old National anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements. In addition, Old National obtains collateral above certain thresholds of the fair value of its hedges for each counterparty based upon their credit standing. All of the contracts to which Old National is a party settle monthly, quarterly, or semiannually. Further, Old National has netting agreements with the dealers with which it does business. 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 

In the ordinary course of business, Old National&#8217;s bank subsidiary has entered into credit-related financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The notional amount of these commitments is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements until they are funded. Old National maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet and is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense included in other expense. 

Repossessed Collateral 

Other real estate owned and repossessed personal property are initially recorded at the fair value of the property less estimated cost to sell and are included in other assets on the balance sheet. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through the completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Any excess recorded investment over the fair value of the property received is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded in noninterest expense, as are the costs of operating the properties. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of sale. 

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 

We purchase certain securities, generally U.S. government-sponsored entity and agency securities, under agreements to resell. The amounts advanced under these agreements represent short-term secured loans and are reflected as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase. These agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions. These secured borrowings are reflected as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. Short-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Securities, generally U.S. government and federal agency securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements can be repledged by the secured party. Additional collateral may be required based on the fair value of the underlying securities. 

Share-Based Compensation 

Compensation cost is recognized for stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock awards and units issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and appreciation rights, while the market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. A third party provider is used to value certain restricted stock units where the performance measure is based on total shareholder return. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount 

of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test, no tax benefit is recorded. 

We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 

Old National is a limited partner in several tax-advantaged limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest in approved qualified affordable housing, renewable energy, or other renovation or community revitalization projects. These investments are included in other assets on the balance sheet, with any unfunded commitments included with other liabilities. Certain of these assets qualify for the proportional amortization method and are amortized over the period that Old National expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense included within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. The other investments are accounted for under the equity method, with the expense included within noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of income. All of our tax credit investments are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period. 

Loss Contingencies 

Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure. 

Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows 

For the purpose of presentation in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash, due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements, and money market investments, which have maturities less than 90 days. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired, are classified at that time according to management&#8217;s intent to either sell or hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management&#8217;s intent is to sell the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented as operating cash flows. When management&#8217;s intent is to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, the cash flows of that loan are presented as investing cash flows. 

The following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information:

There were no acquisitions during 2020 or 2019. 

Business Combinations 

Old National accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Old National typically issues Common Stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of Common Stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. 

Impact of Accounting Changes 

Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2020 

FASB ASC 326 &#8211; In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and all related subsequent amendments thereto (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221; or &#8220;Topic 326&#8221;). The main objective of this amendment is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, including loans held for investment purposes and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendment requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for the in-scope financial assets at the date of origination or acquisition, and at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to enhance their credit loss estimates. The amendment requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization&#8217;s portfolio. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The current expected credit loss measurement will be used to estimate the allowance for credit losses over the life of the financial assets. The amendments in this update became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. 

As previously disclosed, Old National formed a cross-functional committee to oversee the adoption of the ASU at the effective date. A working group was also formed to develop a project plan focused on understanding the ASU, researching issues, identifying data needs for modeling inputs, technology requirements, modeling considerations, and ensuring overarching governance was achieved for each objective and milestone. The working group identified seven distinct loan portfolios for which a model to estimate credit losses has been developed. For all seven loan portfolios, the data sets have been identified, populated, and internally validated. Old National has completed data and model validation testing. During the last half of 2019, the project plan targeted parallel processing of our existing allowance for loan losses model compared to the CECL model, as well as model sensitivity analysis, determination of qualitative adjustments, supporting analytics, and execution of the governance and approval process. Internal controls related to the CECL process were finalized prior to adoption on January 1, 2020. 

The CECL modeling measurements for estimating the current expected life-time credit losses for loans and debt securities includes the following major items: 

&#8226; Initial loss forecast &#8211; using a forecast period of one year for all allowance portfolio segments and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, using forward-looking economic scenarios of expected losses. 

&#8226; Historical loss forecast &#8211; for a period incorporating the remaining contractual life, adjusted for prepayments, and the changes in various economic variables during representative historical and recessionary periods. 

&#8226; Reversion period &#8211; using two years , which links the initial loss forecast to the historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date. 

&#8226; Discounted cash flow aggregator &#8211; using the items above to estimate the life-time credit losses for all portfolios and losses for loans modified as a TDR. 

Old National adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Results for the reporting periods after January 1, 2020 are presented under Topic 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. As of that date, Old National increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by $ 41.3 million and increased the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by $ 4.5 million, since the ASU covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The increase related to the acquired loan portfolio totaled $ 27.1 million. Under the 

previously applicable accounting guidance, any remaining unamortized loan discount on an individual loan could be used to offset a charge-off for that loan, so the allowance for loan losses needed for the acquired loans was reduced by the remaining loan discounts. ASU 2016-13 requires an allowance for credit losses to be recognized in addition to the loan discount. The impact of adopting the ASU, and at each subsequent reporting period, is highly dependent on credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, composition of our loans and available-for-sale securities portfolio, along with other management judgements. As of January 1, 2020, Old National recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $ 31.2 million to decrease retained earnings. 

Old National did not record an allowance for credit losses on its available-for-sale debt securities under the newly codified available-for-sale debt security impairment model, as the majority of these securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal. 

We adopted CECL using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, we did not reassess whether PCI assets met the definition of PCD assets as of the date of adoption. On January 1, 2020, the amortized cost basis of the PCD assets were adjusted to reflect the addition of $ 4.5 million to the allowance for credit losses for loans. The remaining noncredit discount in the amount of $ 11.8 million (based on the adjusted amortized cost basis) will be accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of January 1, 2020. 

The loan categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures. The four loan portfolios are classified into seven segments of loans - commercial, commercial real estate, BBCC, residential real estate, indirect, direct, and home equity. The commercial and commercial real estate loan categories shown on the balance sheet include the same pool of loans as the commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC portfolio segments. The consumer loan category shown on the balance sheet is comprised of the same loans in the indirect, direct, and home equity portfolio segments. The composition of loans by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019 follows:

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

FASB ASC 350 &#8211; In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles: Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, the income tax effects of tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments in this update became effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

FASB ASC 820 &#8211; In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . The updated guidance improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The ASU removes certain disclosures required by Topic 820 related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; the policy for timing of transfers between levels; the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements; and for nonpublic entities, the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in earnings for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period. The ASU modifies certain disclosures required by Topic 820 related to disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities for nonpublic entities; the requirement to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investee&#8217;s assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to the entity or announced the timing publicly for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value; and clarification that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date. The ASU adds certain disclosure requirements related to changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information in lieu of the weighted average if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

FASB ASC 350 &#8211; In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract . The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The amendments in this update became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years and did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

FASB ASC 842 &#8211; In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements . The amendments in ASU No. 2019-01 align the guidance for fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance. As a result, the fair value of the underlying asset at lease commencement is its cost, reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply. However, if there has been a significant lapse of time between when the underlying asset is acquired and when the lease commences, the definition of fair value in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement should be applied. ASU No. 2019-01 also requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, Financial Services&#8212;Depository and Lending , to present all &#8220;principal payments received under leases&#8221; within investing activities. The amendments in this update became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

FASB ASC 326, 815, and 825 &#8211; In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. The amendments related to Topic 326 address accrued interest, transfers between classifications or categories for loans and debt securities, recoveries, vintage disclosures, and contractual extensions and renewal options and became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The improvements and clarifications related to Topic 815 address partial-term fair value hedges of interest-rate risk, amortization, and disclosure of fair value hedge basis adjustments and consideration of hedged contractually specified interest rate under the hypothetical method and became effective for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. The amendments related to Topic 825 contain various improvements to ASU 2016-01, including scope; held-to-maturity debt securities fair value disclosures; and remeasurement of equity securities at historical exchange rates and became effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments in this update did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

FASB ASC 326 &#8211; In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. These amendments provide targeted transition relief allowing entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, for certain financial assets (excluding held-to-maturity debt securities) previously measured at amortized cost. 

In November 2019, the FASB issued 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses , to make improvements to the credit losses standard. Most significantly, the standard clarifies 

guidance around how to report expected recoveries for PCD assets. &#8220;Expected recoveries&#8221; describes a situation in which an organization recognizes a full or partial write-off of the amortized cost basis of a financial asset, but then later determines that the amount written off, or a portion of that amount, will in fact be recovered. This ASU permits organizations to record expected recoveries on PCD assets. In addition to other narrow technical improvements, the ASU also reinforces existing guidance that prohibits organizations from recognizing negative allowances for available-for-sale debt securities. 

The amendments in these updates became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 718 &#8211; In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-08, Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements&#8212;Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. This ASU requires companies to measure and classify (on the balance sheet) share-based payments to customers by applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation . As a result, the amount recorded as a reduction in revenue would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 326 and 842 &#8211; In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-02, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU inserts a paragraph to address the November 2019 issuance of SEC SAB 119, Accounting for Loan Losses by Registrants Engaged in Lending Activities Subject to FASB ASC Topic 326 . The SAB updates existing staff guidance on developing a systematic methodology for estimating credit losses, and it explains the documentation the staff typically would expect from registrants in support of estimates of current expected credit losses for lending activities, when material. The amendments in this update became effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 848 &#8211; In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides temporary, optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, the transition away from the LIBOR or other interbank offered rate on financial reporting. To help with the transition to new reference rates, the ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to affected contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships. The main provisions include: 

&#8226; A change in a contract&#8217;s reference interest rate would be accounted for as a continuation of that contract rather than as the creation of a new one for contracts, including loans, debt, leases, and other arrangements, that meet specific criteria. 

&#8226; When updating its hedging strategies in response to reference rate reform, an entity would be allowed to preserve its hedge accounting. 

The guidance is applicable only to contracts or hedge accounting relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. Because the guidance is meant to help entities through the transition period, it will be in effect for a limited time and will not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The amendments in this ASU are effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. 

ASU 2020-04 permits relief solely for reference rate reform actions and permits different elections over the effective date for legacy and new activity. Accordingly, Old National is evaluating and reassessing the elections on a quarterly basis. For current elections in effect regarding the assertion of the probability of forecasted transactions, Old National elects the expedient to assert the probability of the hedged interest payments and receipts regardless of any expected modification in terms related to reference rate reform. 

Old National believes the adoption of this guidance on activities subsequent to December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2022 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments &#8211; In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments . This ASU was issued to clarify and improve various financial instruments Topics. The amendments include the following improvements: 

&#8226; Issue 1 &#8211; Clarifies that all entities are required to provide fair value option disclosures. 

&#8226; Issue 2 &#8211; Clarifies the applicability of the portfolio exception in measuring fair value for nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives. 

&#8226; Issue 3 &#8211; Clarifies that disclosure requirements in Topic 320 apply to disclosure requirements in Topic 942 for depository and lending institutions. 

&#8226; Issue 4 &#8211; Added cross-reference of line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements guidance to guidance in accounting for fees between debtor and creditor and third-party costs directly related to exchanges or modifications of debt instruments. 

&#8226; Issue 5 &#8211; Clarifies that fair value measurement disclosure requirements do not apply to entities using the net asset value per share practical expedient. 

&#8226; Issue 6 &#8211; Aligns the contractual term to measure expected credit losses for a net investment in a lease under the Credit Loss Standard (Topic 326) with the lease term determined under the Leases Standard (Topic 842). 

&#8226; Issue 7 &#8211; Clarifies that when an entity regains control of financial assets sold, an allowance for credit losses should be recorded in accordance with Topic 326. 

For Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 4, and Issue 5, the amendments are effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. For Issue 3, the amendments to ASU 2016-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. For Issues 6 and 7, the amendments to ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Guidance on Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19 &#8211; On March 22, 2020, a statement was issued by our banking regulators and titled the &#8220;Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus&#8221; (the &#8220;Interagency Statement&#8221;) that encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act that passed on March 27, 2020 further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak declared by the President of the United States under the National Emergencies Act terminates. Section 541 of the CAA extends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency termination date. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators&#8217; views on consumer protection considerations. In accordance with such guidance, we are offering short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. These include short-term (180 days or less) modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. See Note 6 for further information on non-TDR loan modifications. 

Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Yet Adopted &#160; 

FASB ASC 715 &#8211; In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits &#8211; Defined Benefit Plans &#8211; General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans . The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 740 &#8211; In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation; (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and (3) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improves financial statement preparers&#8217; application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income; (2) transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim 

periods. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 321, 323, and 815 &#8211; In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments &#8211; Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments &#8211; Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) &#8211; Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The ASU clarifies the interaction between ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and the ASU on equity method investments. ASU 2016-01 provides companies with an alternative to measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, minus impairment, if any, unless an observable transaction for an identical or similar security occurs. ASU 2020-01 clarifies that for purposes of applying the Topic 321 measurement alternative, an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting under Topic 323, immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. In addition, the new ASU provides direction that a company should not consider whether the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or the fair value option when it is determining the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options, upon either settlement or exercise. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments are to be applied prospectively. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 470 and 815 &#8211; In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging&#8212; Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity&#8217;s Own Equity , to clarify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The amendments in this update reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the cash conversion model and the beneficial conversion feature model. Limiting the accounting models will result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in-capital. In addition, this ASU improves disclosure requirements for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share guidance. The ASU also revises the derivative scope exception guidance to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions driven by remote contingent events. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption will be permitted, but no earlier than for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses and Related Pro Forma Information &#8211; In May 2020, the SEC issued a final rule that revises the circumstances that require financial statements and related pro forma information for acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. The intent of the rule is to allow for more meaningful conclusions on when an acquired or disposed business is significant as well as to improve the related disclosure requirements. The changes are intended to improve the financial information about acquired or disposed businesses, facilitate more timely access to capital, and reduce the complexity and costs to prepare the disclosure. The final rule is effective January 1, 2021; however, voluntary early compliance is permitted. 

FASB ASC 310 &#8211; In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables&#8212;Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs , to clarify that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early application is not permitted. Old National is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASC 470 &#8211; In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-09, Debt (Topic 470) Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10762 , which amends and supersedes various SEC paragraphs to reflect SEC Release No. 33-10762. That release amends the financial disclosure requirements applicable to registered debt offerings that include credit enhancements, such as subsidiary guarantees. These changes are intended to both improve the quality of disclosure and increase the likelihood that issuers will conduct debt offerings on a registered basis. The final rules are effective on January 4, 2021. Voluntary compliance with the final 

amendments in advance of January 4, 2021, will be permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Codification Improvements &#8211; In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-10, Codification Improvements . The amendments improve codification by having all disclosure-related guidance available in the disclosure sections of the codification. Prior to this ASU, various disclosure requirements or options to present information on the face of the financial statements or as a note to the financial statements were not included in the appropriate disclosure sections of the codification. The codification improvements also contain various other minor amendments to codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and early application is permitted. 

NOTE 2 &#8211; INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio and the corresponding amounts of unrealized gains, unrealized losses, and basis adjustments recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):

During the fourth quarter of 2019, Old National inadvertently sold six held-to-maturity classified municipal bond investment securities valued at $ 9.7 million for a gain of $ 0.3 million. After the trade settled, Old National determined the sale of the held-to-maturity investment securities was not one of the permissible sale exceptions afforded by the current accounting guidance. Accordingly, Old National reclassified the entire held-to-maturity portfolio totaling $ 382.0 million into the available-for-sale portfolio, which increased capital by $ 19.4 million. The increase in capital included $ 13.0 million of unrealized holding gains at the date of transfer, net of tax, which is included on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities of $ 93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management does not expect to use the held-to-maturity category for at least two years from the date of the sale. 

Proceeds from sales or calls of available-for-sale investment securities, the resulting realized gains and realized losses, and other securities gains or losses were as follows:

(1) Other securities gains (losses) in 2018 included realized gains and losses of equity securities previously classified as trading securities. For 2020 and 2019, gains (losses) on equity securities are included in other income. 

Investment securities pledged to secure public and other funds had a carrying value of $ 2.427 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 2.104 billion at December 31, 2019. 

At December 31, 2020, Old National had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values: $ 515.6 million issued by Indiana, which represented 17.3 % of shareholders&#8217; equity, and $ 194.3 million issued by Texas, which represented 6.5 % of shareholders&#8217; equity. Of the Indiana municipal bonds, 99 % are rated &#8220;A&#8221; or better, and the remaining 1 % generally represent non-rated local interest bonds where Old National has a market presence. All of the Texas municipal bonds are rated &#8220;A&#8221; or better, and the majority of issues are backed by the &#8220;AAA&#8221; rated State of Texas Permanent School Fund Guarantee Program. 

All of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio are residential mortgage-backed securities. The amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio are shown by contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Weighted average yield is based on amortized cost.

Available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. For available-for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for sale debt securities that do not meet the criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. No allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities 

was needed at December 31, 2020. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled $ 27.0 million at December 31, 2020 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies and mortgage-backed securities &#8211; agency are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major credit rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses. Therefore, for those securities, we do not record expected credit losses. 

Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, we did no t record OTTI in 2019 or 2018. 

At December 31, 2020, Old National&#8217;s securities portfolio consisted of 1,918 securities, 69 of which were in an unrealized loss position. The unrealized losses attributable to our U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, agency mortgage-backed securities, states and political subdivisions, and other securities are the result of fluctuations in interest rates. Our pooled trust preferred securities are discussed below. At December 31, 2020, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

Pooled Trust Preferred Securities 

At December 31, 2020, our securities portfolio contained two pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of $ 7.9 million and unrealized losses of $ 5.9 million. These securities are evaluated using collateral-specific assumptions to estimate the expected future interest and principal cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did no t recognize any losses on these securities. 

The table below summarizes the relevant characteristics of our pooled trust preferred securities as well as our single issuer trust preferred securities that are included in the &#8220;other securities&#8221; category in this footnote. Each of the pooled trust preferred securities support a more senior tranche of security holders. Both pooled trust preferred securities have experienced credit defaults. However, we believe that the value of the instruments lies in the full and timely interest payments that will be received through maturity, the steady amortization that will be experienced until maturity, and the full return of principal by the final maturity of the collateralized debt obligations.

Equity Securities 

Old National&#8217;s equity securities with readily determinable fair values totaled $ 2.5 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 6.8 million at December 31, 2019. There were gains on equity securities of $ 1.4 million during 2020, $ 0.7 million during 2019, and $ 0.1 million during 2018. Old National also has equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are included in other assets that totaled $ 105.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 91.4 million at December 31, 2019. These are illiquid investments that consist of partnerships, limited liability companies, and other ownership interests that support affordable housing, economic development, and community revitalization initiatives in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. There were impairments on these securities totaling $ 117 thousand during 2020 and no impairments or adjustments in 2019 or 2018. 

NOTE 3 &#8211; LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Loans 

Old National&#8217;s loans consist primarily of loans made to consumers and commercial clients in various industries including manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Most of Old National&#8217;s lending activity occurs within our principal geographic markets of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship, and loan size. While loans to lessors of both residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10 % of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10 % threshold. 

The loan categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures. The four loan portfolios are classified into seven segments of loans - commercial, commercial real estate, BBCC, residential real estate, indirect, direct, and home equity. The commercial and commercial real estate loan categories shown on the balance sheet include the same pool of loans as the commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC portfolio segments. The consumer loan category shown on the balance sheet is comprised of the same loans in the indirect, direct, and home equity portfolio segments. The composition of loans by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2020 follows:

(2) Includes remaining PPP loans of $ 943.0 million at December 31, 2020. 

The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: 

Commercial 

Commercial loans are classified primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; 

however, some loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 

Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the PPP, a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Old National has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees were required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. During 2020, Old National originated over 9,700 loans with balances in excess of $ 1.5 billion to new and existing customers through the PPP. At December 31, 2020, remaining PPP loans totaled $ 943.0 million. 

On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CAA. The CAA, among other things, extends the life of the PPP, effectively creating a second round of PPP loans for eligible businesses. Old National is participating in the CAA&#8217;s second round of PPP lending. In mid-January Old National opened its lending portal and began processing PPP loan applications. Currently, Old National is focused on helping minority-owned business, women-owned business, not-for-profit entities, and existing first round PPP customers with the lending process. Additionally, section 541 of the CAA extends the relief provided by the CARES Act for financial institutions to suspend the GAAP accounting treatment for troubled debt restructuring to January 1, 2022. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing Old National&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. 

Included with commercial real estate are construction loans, which are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, financial analysis of the developers and property owners, and feasibility studies, if available. Construction loans are generally based on estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders (including Old National), sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from Old National until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing. 

At 222 %, Old National Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loans as a percentage of its risk-based capital remained well below the regulatory guideline limit of 300 % at December 31, 2020. 

BBCC 

BBCC loans are typically granted to small businesses with gross revenues of less than $5 million and aggregate debt of less than $1 million. Old National has established minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimum FICO scores for owners and guarantors, and the ability to show relatively stable earnings as criteria to help mitigate risk. Repayment of these loans depends on the personal income of the borrowers and the cash flows of the business. These factors can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. 

Residential 

With respect to residential loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner occupied, Old National typically establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and generally requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Repayment can 

also be impacted by changes in residential property values. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers. 

Indirect 

Indirect loans are secured by automobile collateral, generally new and used cars and trucks from auto dealers that operate within our footprint. Old National typically mitigates the risk of indirect loans by establishing minimum FICO scores, maximum loan-to-value ratios, and maximum debt-to-income ratios. Repayment of these loans depends largely on the personal income of the borrowers which can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller amounts spread over many borrowers, conservative credit policies, and ongoing reviews of dealer relationships. 

Direct 

Direct loans are typically secured by collateral such as auto or real estate or are unsecured. Old National has established conservative underwriting standards such as minimum FICO scores, maximum loan-to-value ratios, and maximum debt-to-income ratios. Repayment of these loans depends largely on the personal income of the borrowers which can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller amounts spread over many borrowers along with conservative credit policies. 

Home Equity 

Home equity loans are generally secured by 1-4 family residences that are owner occupied. Old National has established conservative underwriting standards such as minimum FICO scores, maximum loan-to-value ratios, and maximum debt-to-income ratios. Repayment of these loans depends largely on the personal income of the borrowers which can be affected by changes in economic conditions such as unemployment levels. Portfolio risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller amounts spread over many borrowers, along with conservative credit policies as well as monitoring of updated borrower credit scores. 

Related Party Loans 

In the ordinary course of business, Old National grants loans to certain executive officers, directors, and significant subsidiaries (collectively referred to as &#8220;related parties&#8221;). 

Activity in related party loans is presented in the following table:

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Loans 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Old National has made a policy election to report accrued interest receivable as a separate line item on the balance sheet. Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled $ 57.3 million at December 31, 2020 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of its loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. See Note 1 for more information about CECL for loans and unfunded loan commitments. 

The allowance for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the implementation of ASC 326 and the macroeconomic factors surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The forecast scenario includes elevated unemployment, which is forecasted to increase slightly through the second quarter of 2021. The scenario also shows a slight decrease in nominal gross domestic product with a return to growth by the third quarter of 2021. In addition to these quantitative inputs, several qualitative factors were considered, including the risk that the economic decline, specifically unemployment and gross domestic product, prove to be more severe and/or prolonged than our baseline forecast. Also, the efficacy, distribution, and consumption of the vaccine along with new variants of the virus pose additional risk. The mitigating impact of any additional fiscal stimulus, including direct payments to individuals, increased unemployment benefits, as well as the various government sponsored loan programs, was also considered. Old National&#8217;s activity in the allowance for credit losses for loans by portfolio segment was as follows:

PPP loans were factored in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020; however, due to the SBA guaranty and our borrowers&#8217; adherence to the PPP terms, the provision impact was insignificant. 

Unfunded Loan Commitments 

Old National maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet. Old National&#8217;s activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was as follows:

Credit Quality 

Old National&#8217;s management monitors the credit quality of its loans on an ongoing basis with the AQR for commercial loans reviewed annually or at renewal and the performance of its residential and consumer loans based upon the accrual status refreshed at least quarterly. Internally, management assigns an AQR to each non-homogeneous commercial, commercial real estate, and BBCC loan in the portfolio. The primary determinants of the AQR are the reliability of the primary source of repayment and the past, present, and projected financial condition of the borrower. The AQR will also consider current industry conditions. Major factors used in determining the AQR can vary based on the nature of the loan, but commonly include factors such as debt service coverage, internal cash flow, liquidity, leverage, operating performance, debt burden, FICO scores, occupancy, interest rate sensitivity, and expense burden. Old National uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Criticized . Special mention loans that have a potential weakness that deserves management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution&#8217;s credit position at some future date. 

Classified &#8211; Substandard . Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Classified &#8211; Nonaccrual . Loans classified as nonaccrual have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, in doubt. 

Classified &#8211; Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as nonaccrual, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Pass rated loans are those loans that are other than criticized, classified &#8211; substandard, classified &#8211; nonaccrual, or classified &#8211; doubtful.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans 

Old National does not record interest on nonaccrual loans until principal is recovered. For all loan classes, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. Interest accrued but not received is reversed against earnings. Cash interest received on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the principal is recovered or until the loan returns to accrual status. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, remain current for a prescribed period, and future payments are reasonably assured. 

The following table presents the aging of the amortized cost basis in past due loans by class of loans:

Interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans was insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2020. 

When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the loan is expected to be repaid substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The class of loan represents the primary collateral type associated with the loan. Significant quarter over quarter changes are reflective of changes in nonaccrual status and not necessarily associated with credit quality indicators like appraisal value. The following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral dependent loans by class of loan:

Loan Participations 

Old National has loan participations, which qualify as participating interests, with other financial institutions. At December 31, 2020, these loans totaled $ 1.043 billion, of which $ 478.9 million had been sold to other financial institutions and $ 563.6 million was retained by Old National. The loan participations convey proportionate ownership rights with equal priority to each participating interest holder; involve no recourse (other than ordinary representations and warranties) to, or subordination by, any participating interest holder; all cash flows are divided among the participating interest holders in proportion to each holder&#8217;s share of ownership; and no holder has the right to pledge the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Old National may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit Old National by increasing the ultimate probability of collection. 

Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a TDR has occurred, which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, Old National Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk, or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan. 

Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months. 

If we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue, the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss. For large commercial type loans, each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances. Generally, Old National charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under $250,000 that are 90 days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support. For residential and consumer loans, a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes 120 to 180 days past due, whichever is earlier. 

For commercial TDRs, an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value. To determine the computed value of the loan, one of 

the following methods is selected: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, (2) the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or (3) the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value. If there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly. 

When a residential or consumer loan is identified as a TDR, the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs. 

The following table presents activity in TDRs:

TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $ 14.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 13.8 million at December 31, 2019. Old National has allocated specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified as TDRs totaling $ 1.6 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 0.9 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, Old National had no t committed to lend any additional funds to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as TDRs, compared to $ 2.3 million at December 31, 2019. 

The pre-modification and post-modification outstanding recorded investments of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are the same except for when the loan modifications involve the forgiveness of principal. The following table presents loans modified as TDRs that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018: 

##TABLE_START (dollars in thousands) Total Year Ended December 31, 2020 TDR: Number of loans 4 &#160; Pre-modification outstanding recorded investment $ 9,632 &#160; Post-modification outstanding recorded investment 9,632 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2019 TDR: Number of loans 14 &#160; Pre-modification outstanding recorded investment $ 21,131 &#160; Post-modification outstanding recorded investment 21,131 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2018 TDR: Number of loans 10 &#160; Pre-modification outstanding recorded investment $ 5,691 &#160; Post-modification outstanding recorded investment 5,691 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

The TDRs that occurred during 2020 increased the allowance for credit losses by $ 0.3 million and resulted in no charge-offs during 2020. The TDRs that occurred during 2019 increased the allowance for loan losses by $ 2.0 million and resulted in $ 3.9 million in charge-offs during 2019. The TDRs that occurred during 2018 did not have a material impact on the allowance for loan losses and resulted in no charge-offs during 2018. 

A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 

TDRs for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the year were insignificant in 2020, 2019, and 2018. 

The terms of certain other loans were modified during 2020 and 2019 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. It is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that, during the period, have been renewed, have entered into a forbearance agreement, have gone from principal and interest to interest only, or have extended the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. We also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate, additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee. We also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment. 

In general, once a modified loan is considered a TDR, the loan will always be considered a TDR, and therefore impaired, until it is paid in full, otherwise settled, sold, or charged off. However, guidance also permits for loans to be removed from TDR status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances: (1) at the time of the subsequent restructuring, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring, (2) under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement, the institution has granted no concession to the borrower; and (3) the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan. For loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness, the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables &#8211; Overall . However, consistent with ASC 310-40-50-2, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, Creditor Disclosure of Troubled Debt Restructurings , the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria: (1) has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate; and (2) is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring. 

Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19 

On March 22, 2020, the Interagency Statement was issued by our banking regulators that encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak declared by the President of the United States under the National Emergencies Act terminates. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators&#8217; views on consumer protection considerations. In accordance with such guidance, we are offering short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. These include short-term (180 days or less) modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. The table below presents these loan deferrals by loan category: 

##TABLE_START (dollars in thousands) June 30, 2020 Deferrals Balance September 30, 2020 Deferrals Balance December 31, 2020 Deferrals Balance (1) December 31, 2020 Number of Deferrals Commercial and commercial real estate $ 1,170,119 &#160; $ 125,603 &#160; $ 53,823 &#160; 101 &#160; Residential real estate 78,639 &#160; 1,654 &#160; 1,855 &#160; 6 &#160; Consumer 54,786 &#160; 10,315 &#160; 8,224 &#160; 348 &#160; Total $ 1,303,544 &#160; $ 137,572 &#160; $ 63,902 &#160; 455 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Finance Leases 

Old National leases certain banking center buildings under finance leases that are included in premises and equipment. See Notes 6 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for detail regarding these leases. 

NOTE 6 &#8211; LEASES 

Old National determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment and other borrowings in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the implicit lease rate when readily determinable. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 

Old National has operating and finance leases for land, office space, banking centers, and equipment. These leases are generally for periods of 10 to 20 years with various renewal options. We include certain renewal options in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities if they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or a rate are initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date and are included in the measurement of the lease liability. Variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or a rate are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in profit and loss when incurred. Variable lease payments are defined as payments made for the right to use an asset that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. 

Old National has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate leases, non-lease components and other non-components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, and insurance are not included in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally able to be segregated. For certain equipment leases, Old National accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component using the practical expedient available for that class of assets. 

Old National does not have any material sub-lease agreements. 

The components of lease expense were as follows:

Senior Notes 

In August 2014, Old National issued $ 175.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.125 % interest rate. These notes pay interest on February 15 and August 15. The notes mature on August 15, 2024. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities are classified in &#8220;other borrowings.&#8221; On November 1, 2017, Old National acquired Anchor (MN) and exceeded $15 billion in assets. As a result, these 

securities can only be treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, subject to certain limitations. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, these securities qualified as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. 

Through various acquisitions, Old National assumed junior subordinated debenture obligations related to various trusts that issued trust preferred securities. Old National guarantees the payment of distributions on the trust preferred securities issued by the trusts. Proceeds from the issuance of each of these securities were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures with the same financial terms as the securities issued by the trusts. 

Old National, at any time, may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at par and, thereby cause a redemption of the trust preferred securities in whole or in part. In February 2020, Old National redeemed at par $ 4.1 million of junior subordinated debentures issued in October 2002 by Anchor (MN) (as successor to VFSC, Inc.), which was acquired by Old National in 2017. This subsequently caused the redemption of all of the common and capital (preferred) securities issued by VFSC Capital Trust II by the same amount in aggregate. At the time of redemption, the rate on this floating rate instrument was 5.36 %. In March 2020, Old National redeemed at par $ 3.1 million of junior subordinated debentures issued in April 2004 by Anchor (MN) (as successor to VFSC, Inc.), which was acquired by Old National in 2017. This subsequently caused the redemption of all of the common and capital (preferred) securities issued by VFSC Capital Trust III by the same amount in aggregate. At the time of redemption, the rate on this floating rate instrument was 4.71 %. In April 2020, Old National redeemed at par $ 3.1 million of junior subordinated debentures issued in April 2002 by Anchor (MN) (as successor to VFSC, Inc.), which was acquired by Old National in 2017. This subsequently caused the redemption of all of the common and capital (preferred) securities issued by VFSC Capital Trust I by the same amount in aggregate. At the time of redemption, the rate on this floating rate instrument was 5.62 %. 

The following table summarizes the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2020:

Subordinated Debentures 

On November 1, 2017, Old National assumed $ 12.0 million of subordinated fixed-to-floating notes related to the acquisition of Anchor (MN). The subordinated debentures had a 5.75 % fixed rate of interest through October 29, 2020. From October 30, 2020 to the October 30, 2025 maturity date, the debentures have a floating rate of interest equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 4.356 %. 

Finance Lease Liabilities 

Old National has long-term finance lease liabilities for certain banking centers totaling $ 11.8 million. The economic substance of these leases is that Old National is financing the acquisition of the building through the lease and accordingly, the building is recorded as a right-of-use asset in premises and equipment and the lease is recorded as a liability in other borrowings. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using Old National&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a maturity analysis of the Company&#8217;s finance lease liabilities.

The lower effective tax rate in 2020 when compared to 2019 was primarily the result of an increase in federal tax credits available in 2020. 

The higher effective tax rate in 2019 when compared to 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in federal tax credits available in 2019, as well as an increase in pre-tax book income. 

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following components:

Through the acquisition of Anchor (WI) in the second quarter of 2016 and Lafayette Savings Bank in the fourth quarter of 2014, both former thrifts, Old National Bank&#8217;s retained earnings at December 31, 2020 include base-year bad debt reserves, created for tax purposes prior to 1988, totaling $ 52.8 million. Of this total, $ 50.9 million was acquired from Anchor (WI), and $ 1.9 million was acquired from Lafayette Savings Bank. Base-year reserves are subject to recapture in the unlikely event that Old National Bank (1) makes distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, (2) redeems its stock, or (3) liquidates. Old National Bank has no intention of making such a nondividend distribution. Accordingly, under current accounting principles, a related deferred income tax liability of $ 13.0 million has not been recognized. 

No valuation allowance was recorded at December 31, 2020 or 2019 because, based on current expectations, Old National believes it will generate sufficient income in future years to realize deferred tax assets. Old National has federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 52.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 78.5 million at December 31, 2019. This federal net operating loss was acquired from the acquisition of Anchor (WI) in 2016. If not used, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire from 2029 to 2033. Old National has recorded state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 132.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 148.4 million at December 31, 2019. If not used, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire from 2024 to 2033. 

The federal and recorded state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 382. Old National believes that all of the recorded net operating loss carryforwards will be used prior to expiration. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

Old National reduced an immaterial amount of unrecognized tax benefits to zero in 2020 after an Internal Revenue Service audit was finalized. 

Old National and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as filing various state returns. The 2017 through 2020 tax years are open and subject to examination. 

NOTE 16 &#8211; SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

Our Amended and Restated 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#8220;ICP&#8221;), which was shareholder-approved, permits the grant of share-based awards to its employees. At December 31, 2020, 2.9 million shares were available for issuance. The granting of awards to key employees is typically in the form of restricted stock awards or units. We believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders. Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for the ICP was $ 7.7 million in 2020, $ 8.0 million in 2019, and $ 8.1 million in 2018. The total income tax benefit was $ 1.9 million in 2020, $ 2.0 million in 2019, and $ 2.0 million in 2018. 

Restricted Stock Awards 

Restricted stock awards require certain service requirements and commonly have vesting periods of 3 years. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Shares are subject to certain restrictions and risk of forfeiture by the participants. 

A summary of changes in our nonvested shares for the year follows: 

##TABLE_START (shares in thousands) Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Year Ended December 31, 2020 Nonvested balance at beginning of period 406 &#160; $ 16.98 &#160; Granted during the year 365 &#160; 14.79 &#160; Vested during the year ( 193 ) 17.16 &#160; Forfeited during the year ( 20 ) 16.53 &#160; Nonvested balance at end of period 558 &#160; $ 15.51 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 5.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the ICP. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The total fair value of the shares vested was $ 2.9 million in 2020, $ 3.4 million in 2019, and $ 3.4 million in 2018. 

Restricted Stock Units 

Restricted stock units require certain performance requirements and have vesting periods of 3 years. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Shares are subject to certain restrictions and risk of forfeiture by the participants. 

A summary of changes in our nonvested shares for the year follows: 

##TABLE_START (shares in thousands) Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Year Ended December 31, 2020 Nonvested balance at beginning of period 965 &#160; $ 14.07 &#160; Granted during the year 344 &#160; 17.14 &#160; Vested during the year ( 437 ) 16.31 &#160; Forfeited during the year ( 1 ) 12.62 &#160; Dividend equivalents adjustment 40 &#160; 14.48 &#160; Nonvested balance at end of period 911 &#160; $ 14.18 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 3.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the ICP. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our Common Stock at the date of grant; these option awards have vesting periods ranging from 3 to 5 years and have 10 -year contractual terms. 

Old National has not granted stock options since 2009. However, Old National did acquire stock options and stock appreciation rights through prior year acquisitions. Old National recorded no incremental expense associated with the conversion of these options and stock appreciation rights. 

As of December 31, 2020, all options were fully vested and all compensation costs had been expensed. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding shares consisted of stock appreciation rights acquired through prior year acquisitions. 

A summary of the activity in stock appreciation rights in 2020 follows:

Outside Director Stock Compensation Program 

Old National maintains a director stock compensation program covering all outside directors. Compensation shares are earned semi-annually. Beginning in 2017, any shares awarded to directors are anticipated to be issued from the ICP. In 2020, 28 thousand shares were issued to directors, compared to 12 thousand shares in 2019, and 16 thousand shares in 2018. 

Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

The Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan (the &#8220;401(k) Plan&#8221;) permits employees to participate the first month following one month of service. Old National matches 75 % of employee compensation deferral contributions of the first 4 % of compensation, and 50 % of the next 4 % of compensation. In addition to matching contributions, Old National may make discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan in the form of Old National stock or cash. Our Board of Directors designated no discretionary profit sharing contributions in 2020, 2019, or 2018. All contributions vest immediately and plan participants may elect to redirect funds among any of the investment options provided under the 401( k) Plan. The number of Old National shares in the 401(k) Plan were 0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. All shares owned through the 401(k) Plan are included in the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted and basic earnings per share. Contribution expense under the 401(k) Plan was $ 9.5 million in 2020, $ 9.8 million in 2019, and $ 8.6 million in 2018. 

NOTE 17 &#8211; SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 

Old National has a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan under which common shares issued may be either repurchased shares or authorized and previously unissued shares. A new plan became effective on August 13, 2018, with total authorized and unissued common shares reserved for issuance of 3.3 million. At December 31, 2020, 3.3 million authorized and unissued common shares were available for issuance under the plan. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

Old National has an employee stock purchase plan under which eligible employees can purchase common shares at a price not less than 95 % of the fair market value of the common shares on the purchase date. The amount of common shares purchased cannot exceed 10 % of the employee&#8217;s compensation. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased under this plan is 500,000 shares. In 2020, 43,000 shares were issued related to this plan with proceeds of approximately $ 577,000 . In 2019, 36,000 shares were issued related to this plan with proceeds of approximately $ 567,000 . 

Share Repurchase Plan 

In the first quarter of 2020, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 7.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common shares to be repurchased, as conditions warrant, through January 31, 2021. During 2020, Old National repurchased 4.9 million common shares under the plan, which reduced equity by $ 78.7 million. The program was suspended in March 2020 given the uncertain economic conditions. 

On January 28, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stock repurchase plan that authorizes the repurchase of up to $ 100 million of shares of Common Stock, as conditions warrant, through January 31, 2022. 

Net Income per Share 

Basic and diluted net income per share are calculated using the two-class method. Net income is divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Adjustments to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute net income per common share. Net income is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents during the period. 

The following table reconciles basic and diluted net income per share.

NOTE 18 &#8211; FAIR VALUE 

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

Old National used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 

Investment securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Discounted cash flows are calculated using swap and LIBOR curves plus spreads that adjust for loss severities, volatility, credit risk, and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations. 

Residential loans held for sale : The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan (Level 2). 

Derivative financial instruments : The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on derivative valuation models using market data inputs as of the valuation date (Level 2). 

Recurring Basis 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including financial assets and liabilities for which we have elected the fair value option, are summarized below:

The accretion or amortization of discounts on securities in the table above is included in interest income. The increase in the fair value of securities in the table above is included in the unrealized holding gains (losses) for the period in the statement of other comprehensive income. An increase in fair value is reflected in the balance sheet as an increase in the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in shareholders&#8217; equity, and a decrease in other assets related to the tax impact. The decrease in the fair value of securities in the table above is included in the unrealized holding gains (losses) for the period in the statement of other comprehensive income. A decrease in fair value is reflected in the balance sheet as a decrease in the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in shareholders&#8217; equity, and an increase in other assets related to the tax impact. During 2019, Old National received third party pricing on a $ 4.0 million state and political subdivisions security and transferred it out of Level 3. Old National transferred $ 4.1 million of state and political subdivisions securities to Level 3 during 2018 because Old National could no longer obtain evidence of observable inputs. 

The table below provides quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:

(1) Assuming no prepayments. 

(2) Each currently performing pool asset is assigned a default probability based on the banking environment, which is adjusted for specific issuer evaluation, of 0 %, 50 %, or 100 %. 

(3) Each currently defaulted pool asset is assigned a recovery probability based on specific issuer evaluation of 0 %, 25 %, or 100 %. 

(4) Unobservable inputs are weighted by the estimated number of defaults and current performing collateral of the instruments. 

Significant changes in any of the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement in isolation would have resulted in a significant change to the fair value measurement. The pooled trust preferred securities Old National owns are subordinate note classes that rely on an ongoing cash flow stream to support their values. The senior note classes receive the benefit of prepayments to the detriment of subordinate note classes since the ongoing interest cash flow stream is reduced by the early redemption. Generally, a change in prepayment rates or additional pool asset defaults would have an impact that is directionally opposite from a change in the expected recovery of a defaulted pool asset. 

Non-Recurring Basis 

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below: 

##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2020 Using (dollars in thousands) Carrying Value Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Collateral Dependent Loans: Commercial loans $ 10,747 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10,747 &#160; Commercial real estate loans 40,653 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 40,653 &#160; Loan servicing rights 26,717 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 26,717 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END

Commercial and commercial real estate loans that are deemed collateral dependent are valued using the discounted cash flows. The liquidation amounts are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral using the most recently available appraisals with certain adjustments made based on the type of property, age of appraisal, current status of the property, and other related factors to estimate the current value of the collateral. These commercial and commercial real estate loans had a principal amount of $ 57.2 million, with a valuation allowance of $ 5.8 million at December 31, 2020. Old National recorded provision expense associated with these loans totaling $ 2.1 million in 2020. 

Other real estate owned and other repossessed property is measured at fair value less costs to sell. Old National did not have any other real estate owned or repossessed property measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2020. There were write-downs of other real estate owned of $ 161 thousand in 2020. 

Loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an individual tranche exceeds fair value, impairment is recorded on that 

tranche so that the servicing asset is carried at fair value. Fair value is determined at a tranche level, based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model utilizes a discount rate, weighted average prepayment speed, and other economic factors that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and that can be validated against available market data (Level 2). The valuation allowance for loan servicing rights with impairments at December 31, 2020 totaled $ 1.4 million. Old National recorded impairments associated with these loan servicing rights totaling $ 1.4 million in 2020.

Fair Value Option 

Old National may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in net income. After the initial adoption, the election is made at the acquisition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability, or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made. 

Residential Loans Held For Sale 

Old National has elected the fair value option for residential loans held for sale. For these loans, interest income is recorded in the consolidated statements of income based on the contractual amount of interest income earned on the financial assets (except any that are on nonaccrual status). None of these loans are 90 days or more past due, nor are any on nonaccrual status. Included in the income statement is interest income for loans held for sale totaling $ 2.0 million in 2020, $ 1.4 million in 2019, and $ 0.5 million in 2018. 

Old National has elected the fair value option for newly originated conforming fixed-rate and adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held for sale. These loans are intended for sale and are hedged with derivative instruments. Old National has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplification. The fair value option was not elected for loans held for investment. 

The difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining principal balance for loans for which the fair value option has been elected was as follows:

The methods utilized to measure the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 represent an approximation of exit price, however, an actual exit price may differ. 

NOTE 19 &#8211; DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

As part of our overall interest rate risk management, Old National uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, collars, caps, and floors. The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual agreements. The notional amounts of these derivative instruments were $ 1.452 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 665.5 million at December 31, 2019. These derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2020 consisted of $ 379.0 million notional amount of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its borrowings, $ 347.5 million notional amount of pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its available-for-sale investment securities, $ 325.0 million notional amount of pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its borrowings, and $ 400.0 million notional amount interest rate collars and floors related to variable-rate commercial loan pools. Derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2019 consisted of $ 130.5 million notional amount of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its borrowings, $ 25.0 million notional amount of pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps on certain of its borrowings, and $ 510.0 million notional amount interest rate collars and floors related to variable-rate commercial loan pools. These hedges were entered into to manage interest rate risk. Derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and are not reported on a net basis. 

In accordance with ASC 815-20-35-1, subsequent changes in fair value for a hedging instrument that has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship should be accounted for in the following manner: 

Cash flow hedges : changes in fair value are recognized as a component in other comprehensive income. 

Fair value hedges : changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings. 

As long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, 100 % of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are 

accounted for as outlined above. This is the case whether or not economic mismatches exist in the hedging relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge gains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings. 

The change in fair value of the hedging instrument that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is presented in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. 

Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate lock commitments) and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors are considered derivatives. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. At December 31, 2020, the notional amounts of the interest rate lock commitments were $ 224.7 million and forward commitments were $ 261.0 million. At December 31, 2019, the notional amounts of the interest rate lock commitments were $ 65.7 million and forward commitments were $ 101.6 million. It is our practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans to third party investors when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from our commitment to fund the loans. 

Old National also enters into derivative instruments for the benefit of its customers. The notional amounts of these customer derivative instruments and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $ 2.008 billion at December 31, 2020. The notional amounts of these customer derivative instruments and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $ 1.298 billion at December 31, 2019. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include interest rate swaps, caps, and collars. &#160; Commonly, Old National will economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. 

Old National enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency risk management strategies. These derivative instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. Old National does not designate these foreign currency forward contracts for hedge accounting treatment. The notional amounts of these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $ 9.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 8.2 million at December 31, 2019. 

Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. Old National&#8217;s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal, or contract amounts. There are provisions in our agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, we minimize credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures. 

Amounts reported in AOCI related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified to interest income or interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on Old National&#8217;s derivative instruments. During the next 12 months, we estimate that $ 6.1 million will be reclassified to interest income and $ 1.8 million will be reclassified to interest expense. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative financial instruments utilized by Old National:

NOTE 20 &#8211; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

COVID-19 

As previously disclosed, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China and continues to unfold across the U.S. The spread of the COVID-19 virus had an impact on our operations as of December 31, 2020, and the Company expects that the virus will continue to have an impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its customers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in the behavior of customers, businesses, and their employees, including illness, quarantines, social distancing practices, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Future effects, including additional actions taken by federal, state, and local governments to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, are unknown. However, if these actions are sustained, it may adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of Old National&#8217;s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause Old National to experience a material adverse effect on our business operations, asset valuations, financial condition, and results of operations. Material adverse impacts may include all or a combination of valuation impairments on Old National&#8217;s intangible assets, investments, loans, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, or counter-party risk derivatives. 

Litigation 

In the normal course of business, Old National Bancorp and its subsidiaries have been named, from time to time, as defendants in various legal actions. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. 

Old National contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, Old National cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, Old National believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Old National, although the outcome of such matters could be material to Old National&#8217;s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, the level of Old National&#8217;s revenues or income for such period. Old National will accrue for a loss contingency if (1) it is probable that a future event will occur and confirm the loss and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 

Old National is not currently involved in any material litigation. 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 

In the normal course of business, Old National&#8217;s banking affiliates have entered into various agreements to extend credit, including loan commitments of $ 3.720 billion and standby letters of credit of $ 86.9 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, approximately $ 3.463 billion of the loan commitments had fixed rates and $ 257.8 million had floating rates, with the floating interest rates ranging from 0 % to 14 %. At December 31, 2019, loan commitments totaled $ 2.779 billion and standby letters of credit totaled $ 87.8 million. These commitments are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments totaled $ 11.7 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 2.7 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in allowance for unfunded loan commitments included a cumulative-effect adjustment of $ 4.5 million effective January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASC 326. See Note 1 for additional information about CECL for unfunded loan commitments. 

Old National had credit extensions with various unaffiliated banks related to letter of credit commitments issued on behalf of Old National&#8217;s clients totaling $ 7.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 8.7 million at December 31, 2019. Old National provided collateral to the unaffiliated banks to secure credit extensions totaling $ 7.5 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 7.7 million December 31, 2019. Old National did not provide collateral for the remaining credit extensions. 

Visa Class B Restricted Shares 

In 2008, Old National received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa&#8217;s initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A 

common shares. This conversion will not occur until the final settlement of certain litigation for which Visa is indemnified by the holders of Visa&#8217;s Class B shares, including Old National. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Increases in litigation claims requiring Visa to fund the escrow account due to insufficient funds will result in a reduction of the conversion ratio of each Visa Class B share to unrestricted Class A shares. As of December 31, 2020, the conversion ratio was 1.6228 . Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation, the 65,466 Class B shares that Old National owns at December 31, 2020 are carried at a zero cost basis and are included in other assets with our equity securities that have no readily determinable fair value. 

NOTE 21 &#8211; FINANCIAL GUARANTEES 

Old National holds instruments, in the normal course of business with clients, that are considered financial guarantees in accordance with FASB ASC 460-10 (FIN 45, Guarantor&#8217;s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ) , which requires Old National to record the instruments at fair value. Standby letters of credit guarantees are issued in connection with agreements made by clients to counterparties. Standby letters of credit are contingent upon failure of the client to perform the terms of the underlying contract. Credit risk associated with standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that associated with extending loans to clients and is subject to normal credit policies. The term of these standby letters of credit is typically one year or less. At December 31, 2020, the notional amount of standby letters of credit was $ 86.9 million, which represented the maximum amount of future funding requirements, and the carrying value was $ 0.5 million. At December 31, 2019, the notional amount of standby letters of credit was $ 87.8 million, which represented the maximum amount of future funding requirements, and the carrying value was $ 0.6 million. 

Old National is a party in risk participation transactions of interest rate swaps, which had total notional amount of $ 54.3 million at December 31, 2020. 

NOTE 22 &#8211; REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 

Old National&#8217;s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within noninterest income. The consolidated statements of income include all categories of noninterest income. The following table reflects only the categories of noninterest income that are within the scope of Topic 606: 

##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Wealth management fees $ 36,806 &#160; $ 37,072 &#160; $ 36,863 &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts 35,081 &#160; 44,915 &#160; 44,026 &#160; Debit card and ATM fees 20,178 &#160; 21,652 &#160; 20,216 &#160; Investment product fees 21,614 &#160; 21,785 &#160; 20,539 &#160; Other income: Merchant processing fees 3,150 &#160; 3,105 &#160; 2,927 &#160; Gain (loss) on other real estate owned 240 &#160; 254 &#160; 1,270 &#160; Safe deposit box fees 957 &#160; 1,206 &#160; 1,124 &#160; Insurance premiums and commissions 407 &#160; 815 &#160; 399 &#160; Total $ 118,433 &#160; $ 130,804 &#160; $ 127,364 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

Wealth management fees : Old National earns wealth management fees based upon asset custody and investment management services provided to individual and institutional customers. Most of these customers receive monthly or quarterly billings for services rendered based upon the market value of assets in custody. Fees that are transaction based are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed. 

Service charges on deposit accounts : Old National earns fees from deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees and overdraft fees are recognized at a point in time, since the customer generally has a right to cancel the depository arrangement at any time. The arrangement is considered a day-to-day contract with ongoing renewals and optional purchases, so the duration of the contract does not extend beyond the services already performed. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which Old National satisfies its performance obligation. 

Debit card and ATM fees : Debit card and ATM fees include ATM usage fees and debit card interchange income. As with the transaction-based fees on deposit accounts, the ATM fees are recognized at the point in time that Old National fulfills the customer&#8217;s request. Old National earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions processed through card association networks. Interchange rates are generally set by the card associations based upon purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. 

Investment product fees : Investment product fees are the commissions and fees received from a registered broker/dealer and investment adviser that provide those services to Old National customers. Old National acts as an agent in arranging the relationship between the customer and the third-party service provider. These fees are recognized monthly from the third-party broker based upon services already performed, net of the processing fees charged to Old National by the broker. 

NOTE 23 &#8211; REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS 

Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks 

Prior to March of 2020, Old National&#8217;s affiliate bank was required to maintain reserve balances on hand and with the Federal Reserve Bank that are interest-bearing and unavailable for investment purposes. The Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0% effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. The reserve balances were $ 115.3 million at December 31, 2019. In addition, Old National had cash and due from banks which was held as collateral for collateralized swap positions of $ 7.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 6.9 million at December 31, 2019. 

Restrictions on Transfers from Affiliate Bank 

Regulations limit the amount of dividends an affiliate bank can declare in any year without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years . Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2018, 2019, or 2020 and is not currently required. 

Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends 

Old National has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on Old National&#8217;s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. 

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and Old National Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Old National&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Old National and Old National Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Old National and Old National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the following tables. 

At December 31, 2020, Old National and Old National Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; based on the most recent regulatory notification. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Old National Bank&#8217;s category. 

The following table summarizes capital ratios for Old National and Old National Bank:

(1) As of January 1, 2019, Basel III Capital Rules required banking organizations to maintain: a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;; a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets of at least 4.0 %. 

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.

NOTE 25 &#8211; SEGMENT INFORMATION 

Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Old National Bank, Old National&#8217;s bank subsidiary, is the only significant subsidiary upon which management makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Each of the banking centers of Old National Bank provide a group of similar community banking services, including such products and services as commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, cash management, brokerage, trust, and investment advisory services. The individual banking centers located throughout our Midwest footprint have similar operating and economic characteristics. While the chief decision maker monitors the revenue streams of the various products, services, and regional locations, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the community banking services and banking center locations are considered by management to be aggregated into one reportable operating segment, community banking.
