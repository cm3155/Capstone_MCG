NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The Company&#8217;s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist users of the financial information in assessing the Company&#8217;s operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the following table. 

The Company presents net income per common share and net income applicable to common shares, adjusted for certain notable items. These items include gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, the expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets, FDIC special assessment expense, contract termination charges, merger-related charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions, debt securities gains/losses, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023 event at our downtown Louisville location (&#8220;Louisville expenses&#8221;), and property optimization charges. Management believes excluding these items from net income per common share and net income applicable to common shares may be useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these metrics may be useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes. 

The taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes. 

In management&#8217;s view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as users of the financial information, in assessing the Company&#8217;s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution&#8217;s capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders&#8217; equity and retain the effect of AOCI in shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Although intended to enhance understanding of the Company&#8217;s business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance. See the previously provided tables and the following reconciliations in the &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein. 

The following table presents GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the previous five quarters:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Old National is the sixth largest commercial bank headquartered in the Midwest by asset size and ranks among the top 30 banking companies headquartered in the United States with consolidated assets of approximately $50 billion at March 31, 2024. The Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters and principal executive office is located in Evansville, Indiana with commercial and consumer banking operations headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary and non-bank affiliates, we provide a wide range of services primarily throughout the Midwest region of the United States and elsewhere, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, as well as private banking, capital markets, brokerage, wealth management, trust, investment advisory, and other traditional banking services. 

Net income applicable to common shares for the first quarter of 2024 was $116.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, compared to $128.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Results for the first quarter of 2024 were impacted by a $13.3 million non-cash, pre-tax expense associated with the distribution of excess pension plan assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest defined benefit pension plan, as well as pre-tax charges of $3.0 million for an FDIC special assessment and $2.9 million of merger-related charges. Results for the fourth quarter of 2023 were impacted by the $21.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, $19.1 million for an FDIC special assessment, and $9.9 million of merger-related and other expenses. Excluding these items, net income applicable to common shares for the first quarter of 2024 was $130.8 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share on an adjusted basis 1 , compared to $134.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share on an adjusted basis 1 , for the fourth quarter of 2023. 

We achieved strong results during the first quarter of 2024, including growth in total loans and deposits, modest compression of net interest income reflective of the rate environment, strong credit quality, and disciplined expense management. 

Deposits : Period-end total deposits increased $464.2 million to $37.7 billion, reflecting continued efforts to compete for new client relationships as well as normal seasonally lower patterns in business checking and public funds compared to December 31, 2023. 

Loans : Our loan balances, excluding loans held-for-sale, increased $631.4 million to $33.6 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by broad-based, disciplined commercial and commercial real estate loan growth. 

Net Interest Income : Net interest income decreased $8.0 million to $356.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 driven by higher funding costs and fewer days in the quarter, partly offset by loan growth. 

Provision for Credit Losses : Provision for credit losses increased $7.3 million to $18.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 reflecting net charge-offs and loan growth, as well as economic factors. 

Noninterest Income : Noninterest income decreased $22.6 million to $77.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 reflecting the $21.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding this gain, noninterest income decreased slightly driven by lower capital markets income, partially offset by increases in mortgage fees, wealth fees, and other income. 

Noninterest Expense : Noninterest expense decreased $21.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For the first quarter of 2024, noninterest expense included a $13.3 million non-cash, pre-tax expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest plan, as well as pre-tax charges of $3.0 million for the FDIC special assessment, and $2.9 million of merger-related expenses compared to pre-tax charges of $19.1 million for the FDIC special assessment and $9.9 million of merger-related and other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding these expenses, noninterest expense decreased $12.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to elevated performance-driven incentive accruals and higher amortization of tax credit investments for the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as lower professional fees and other expense for the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by higher payroll taxes due to timing.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 82% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The Federal Reserve held its interest rates steady during the first quarter of 2024 and increased interest rates compared to March 31, 2023. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Funds Rate is currently in a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, with the Effective Federal Funds Rate of 5.33% at March 31, 2024. Management actively takes balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate interest rate risk. See the section of this Item 7 titled &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; for additional information regarding this risk. 

Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and net interest margin. 

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from interest-earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the current federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for all periods. This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes for both management and investors. 

The following table presents the average balance sheet for each major asset and liability category, its related interest income and yield, or its expense and rate.

(1) The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances. 

(2) Interest income on investment securities includes taxable equivalent adjustments of $2.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the federal statutory rate in effect of 21%. 

(3) Interest income on loans includes taxable equivalent adjustments of $3.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the federal statutory rate in effect of 21%. 

The decrease in net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher costs and balances of average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher rates on loans as well as loan growth. Accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled $5.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $7.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher costs of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher yields on interest earning assets. The yield on interest earning assets increased 67 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 130 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same quarter a year ago. Accretion income represented 5 basis points of the net interest margin in three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 8 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Average earning assets were $44.2 billion and $41.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $2.2 billion, or 5%, primarily due to strong loan growth. 

Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to strong commercial real estate loan growth. 

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $2.3 billion while average interest-bearing deposits increased $4.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 reflecting a mix shift as a result of the current rate environment and organic growth. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The following table details the components of the provision for credit losses: 

Three Months Ended March 31, % (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Provision for credit losses on loans $ 23,853 &#160; $ 11,469 108.0 % Provision (release) for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments (4,962) 1,968 (352.1) Total provision for credit losses $ 18,891 &#160; $ 13,437 40.6 % Net (charge-offs) recoveries on non-PCD loans $ (6,061) $ (4,038) 50.1 % Net (charge-offs) recoveries on PCD loans (5,689) (12,391) (54.1) Total net (charge-offs) recoveries on loans $ (11,750) $ (16,429) (28.5) % Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans 0.14 &#160; % 0.21 % (32.7) % 

Total provision for credit losses on loans increased in the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflecting loan growth and macroeconomic factors. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

Noninterest Income 

We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. The following table details the components in noninterest income: 

Three Months Ended March 31, % (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Wealth and investment services fees $ 28,304 &#160; $ 26,920 5.1 % Service charges on deposit accounts 17,898 &#160; 17,003 5.3 Debit card and ATM fees 10,054 &#160; 9,982 0.7 Mortgage banking revenue 4,478 &#160; 3,400 31.7 Capital markets income 2,900 &#160; 6,939 (58.2) Company-owned life insurance 3,434 &#160; 3,186 7.8 Debt securities gains (losses), net (16) (5,216) (99.7) Other income 10,470 &#160; 8,467 23.7 Total noninterest income $ 77,522 &#160; $ 70,681 9.7 % 

Noninterest income increased $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to $5.2 million of net losses on sales of debt securities in the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Mortgage banking revenue increased $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher mortgage originations and increased loan sales. 

Capital markets income decreased $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower levels of commercial real estate client interest rate swap fees. 

Other income increased $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher commercial loan fees. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table details the components in noninterest expense:

Noninterest expense increased $11.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a $13.3 million non-cash, pre-tax expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest plan in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Merger-related expenses totaled $2.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $14.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023. In addition, the three months ended March 31, 2024 were impacted by $3.0 million for the FDIC special assessment and the three months ended March 31, 2023 were impacted by $1.3 million of property optimization charges. Excluding these items, total noninterest expense was $243.1 million and $234.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The resulting $8.3 million increase in noninterest expense was driven by higher salary and employee benefits reflecting merit and performance-driven incentive accruals. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The effective tax rate was 21.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 22.0% for the same period in 2023 reflecting decreases in pre-tax book income and state income taxes combined with an increase in tax credits. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.. In accordance with ASC 740-270, Accounting for Interim Reporting, the provision for income taxes was recorded at March 31, 2024 based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Overview 

At March 31, 2024, our assets were $49.5 billion, a $445.1 million increase compared to assets of $49.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by disciplined loan growth, partially offset by lower cash balances. 

Earning Assets 

Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, money market investments, interest-earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $44.5 billion at March 31, 2024, a $534.2 million increase compared to earning assets of $43.9 billion at December 31, 2023 driven primarily by loan growth. 

Investment Securities 

We classify the majority of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements. 

The investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $10.2 billion and represented 23% of earning assets at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of $914.2 million and $869.5 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The investment securities held-to-maturity portfolio had net unrealized losses of $453.8 million and $412.3 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio including securities hedges had an effective duration of 4.35 at March 31, 2024, compared to 4.24 at December 31, 2023. The total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.42 at March 31, 2024, compared to 5.35 at December 31, 2023. Effective duration represents the percentage change in the fair value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates and is used to evaluate the portfolio&#8217;s price volatility at a single point in time. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage. The annualized average yields on investment securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, were 3.47% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Loan Portfolio 

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including real estate rental and leasing, manufacturing, healthcare, wholesale trade, construction, and agriculture, among others. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size. The following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio:

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 55% of earning assets at both March 31, 2024, compared to 54% at December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans at March 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was driven by disciplined loan production that was well balanced across our market footprint and product lines. 

The following table provides detail on commercial loans by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System) and by loan size.

(1) Includes unfunded loan commitments. 

(2) Other includes commercial development, agriculture real estate, hotels, self-storage, land development, religion, and mixed-use properties. 

The mix of properties securing the loans in our commercial real estate portfolio is balanced between owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied categories and is diverse in terms of type and geographic location, generally within the 

Company&#8217;s primary market area. Approximately 28% of the commercial real estate portfolio is owner-occupied as of March 31, 2024, compared to 25% at December 31, 2023. 

The Company actively reviews its broader loan portfolio in the normal course of business and has performed a targeted review of contractual maturities in its non-owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio as part of its response to current market conditions to identify exposure to credit risk associated with renewals. At March 31, 2024, the Company held $430.2 million of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, or 1.3% of total loans, that mature within 18 months with an interest rate below 4%. 

Residential Real Estate Loans 

At March 31, 2024, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $6.7 billion, a decrease of $38.1 million compared to December 31, 2023. Changes in interest rates may impact the number of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. If interest rates decrease in the future, there may be an increase in refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. Conversely, future increases in interest rates may result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including automobile loans, personal, and home equity loans and lines of credit, increased $20.1 million to $2.7 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 reflecting higher indirect loans. 

Funding 

The following table summarizes Old National&#8217;s total funding, comprised of deposits and wholesale borrowings:

We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 12% at March 31, 2024, compared to 13% at December 31, 2023. 

Capital &#160; 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $5.6 billion at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Retained earnings were offset by dividends and changes in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities and derivatives during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. At March 31, 2024, Old National and its bank subsidiary exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; based on the most recent regulatory definition. 

Old National&#8217;s consolidated capital position remains strong as evidenced by the following key industry ratios. 

Regulatory Guidelines Minimum Prompt Corrective Action "Well Capitalized" Guidelines March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) 4.00 % N/A % 8.96 &#160; % 8.83 % Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted total assets 7.00 N/A 10.76 &#160; 10.70 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted total assets 8.50 6.00 11.40 &#160; 11.35 Total capital to risk-weighted total assets 10.50 10.00 12.74 &#160; 12.64 Shareholders&#8217; equity to assets N/A N/A 11.30 &#160; 11.33

During 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC issued final rules to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rules provide banking organizations the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

Management views stress testing as an integral part of the Company&#8217;s risk management and strategic planning activities. Old National performs stress testing periodically throughout the year. The primary objective of the stress test is to ensure that Old National has a robust, forward-looking stress testing process and maintains sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Management also uses the stress testing framework to evaluate decisions relating to pricing, loan concentrations, capital deployment, and mergers and acquisitions to ensure that strategic decisions align with Old National&#8217;s risk appetite statement. Old National&#8217;s stress testing process incorporates key risks that include strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, regulatory, compliance, legal, and reputational risks. Old National&#8217;s stress testing policy outlines steps that will be taken if stress test results do not meet internal thresholds under severely adverse economic scenarios. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Overview 

Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable our Board of Directors, Executive Leadership Team, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, monitor, and mitigate Old National&#8217;s risks. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, talent management, compliance and regulatory, legal, and reputational. Our Chief Risk Officer provides quarterly reports to the Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Committee on various risk topics. The following discussion addresses certain of these major risks including credit, market, and liquidity. Discussion of operational, compliance and regulatory, legal, strategic, talent management, and reputational risks is provided in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities. 

Asset Quality 

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including, among others, real estate rental and leasing, manufacturing, healthcare, wholesale trade, construction, and agriculture. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size. At March 31, 2024, our average commercial loan size was approximately $720,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately $1,530,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At March 31, 2024, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily in the Midwest region of the United States. 

The following table presents a summary of under-performing, criticized, and classified assets:

(1) Includes investment securities that fell below investment grade rating. 

(2) Loans exclude loans held-for-sale. 

Under-performing assets increased to $340.2 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $285.2 million at December 31, 2023. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans at March 31, 2024 were 1.01%, a 15 basis point increase from 0.86% at December 31, 2023. 

Nonaccrual loans increased $53.8 million from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024 reflecting the migration of certain commercial credits as they progress to resolution. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 97.28% at March 31, 2024, compared to 111.93% at December 31, 2023. 

Total criticized and classified assets were $1.8 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $70.8 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher criticized and classified commercial real estate loans. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $54.4 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $48.9 million at December 31, 2023. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Commitments 

Net charge-offs on loans totaled $11.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $16.4 million for the same period in 2023. Annualized, net charge-offs to average loans were 0.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 0.21% for the same period in 2023. The three months ended March 31, 2024 included net charge-offs on PCD loans totaling $5.7 million, or 0.07% on an annualized basis of average loans, 

compared to net charge-offs on PCD loans totaling $12.4 million, or 0.16% on an annualized basis of average loans for the same period in 2023. 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans was $319.7 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $307.6 million at December 31, 2023. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $26.3 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $31.2 million at December 31, 2023. 

See the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our credit risk. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes. 

The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to 

changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, client preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. 

In managing interest rate risk, we establish guidelines for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates, which are reviewed with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including: 

&#8226; adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; 

&#8226; changing product pricing strategies; 

&#8226; modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; or 

&#8226; using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree. 

A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on Old National&#8217;s results of operations. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario over a two-year cumulative horizon resulting from an immediate change in interest rates using multiple rate scenarios. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions. Due to the dynamics of future interest rate expectations, we also measure and monitor interest rate risk using the forward curve, which may be a more probable scenario of our interest rate exposure. The forward curve represents the relationship between the price of forward contracts and the time to maturity of the forward contracts at a point in time. Presentation of the forward curve model is included in the following table as of March 31, 2024. 

The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two-year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model at March 31, 2024 and 2023:

Our projected net interest income increased year over year due to loan growth and rising interest rates. 

A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which have no contractual maturity dates. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested. 

We use cash flow and fair value hedges, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, to mitigate interest rate risk. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of $12.4 million at March 31, 2024, compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of $4.5 million at 

December 31, 2023. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. We establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and monitor through our Asset/Liability Executive Management Committee. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, to properly manage capital markets&#8217; funding sources, and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. On May 31, 2023, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are not as predictable as they are strongly influenced by interest rates, events at other banking organizations, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments.

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by Old National Bank to Old National Bancorp on an unconsolidated basis without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2023 and is not currently required. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience, future forecasts, or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

For additional information regarding critical accounting estimates, see the section titled &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in the Company&#8217;s application of critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.
