Human Capital Management 

Our enduring ambition is to build the best global team&#8212;one that is inclusive of varying perspectives, backgrounds and experiences, and represents the increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our core objective is to empower our teams to do their best work, make unique contributions and build purposeful careers in an environment where they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect. 

Belonging and Inclusion 

Belonging and inclusion is integral to who we are as a company, what our people experience as members of our global team, and how we serve all of our stakeholders. Our strategy is not separate, but embedded in the way we do business, our operating model, talent experience and client value proposition. 

We aim for fair inclusion by working with professional associations, educational institutions, think tanks and nonprofits to deepen engagement with Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, LGBT+, neuro-diverse individuals, people with disabilities and talent from other underrepresented backgrounds.

Retention, Training and Development 

We seek to attract and retain employees by providing a rewarding employee experience. We recognize that employees seek a supportive, safe and inclusive workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee 

engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to meet those expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees and other defined contribution retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with market practice. We also maintain defined benefit plans for certain current and former employees, some of which are frozen (including in the U.S.). At Dec. 31, 2023, we had approximately 43,100 participants in our 401(k) plan, including former employees. In addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan covered approximately 7,400 U.S. participants, and our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen) covered approximately 18,000 non-U.S. participants. 

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has provided eligible employees an award of 10 restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) or BK Shares. BK Shares is an equity grant that allows for eligible employees to become equity owners and share in the Company&#8217;s success. 

At key career transition points, from internship to executive management, we offer programs and development opportunities to help employees advance their careers and progress within our organization. Our extensive training and development opportunities are designed to enable employees to grow professionally and advance within our organization. 

We engage with employees to encourage innovation, show appreciation for their contributions, and gather feedback on how we can build a more rewarding, inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly gather feedback through an all-employee survey.

Information on the supervision and regulation of BNY Mellon can be found in the &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Competition 

BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial 

services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. 

Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees, retain, develop and motivate our existing employees, amid heightened regulatory restrictions and an inflationary environment. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, and as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. 

For additional discussion regarding competition, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Operational Risk &#8211; Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate employees&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Strategic Risk &#8211; We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability&#8221; in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
