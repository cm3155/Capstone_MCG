 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We are subject to various unresolved legal actions, the most prevalent of which relate to retail credit matters. Currently we believe the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, the outcome of any unresolved legal action cannot be predicted with certainty.
