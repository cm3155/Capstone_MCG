 Item 2. &#8197; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

All amounts are presented in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

OVERVIEW 

Organization 

We provide financial solutions that enable John Deere customers and dealers to advance their lives and livelihoods. Through our offering of retail notes, leases, and revolving charge accounts, customers are able to finance new and used John Deere equipment, as well as parts, services, and other input costs needed to run their operations. We also provide wholesale financing to John Deere dealers. 

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere announced the Smart Industrial Operating Model in 2020. This operating model is based on three focus areas: 

(a)

Production systems: A strategic alignment of products and solutions around John Deere customers&#8217; operations.

(b)

Technology stack: Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to John Deere customers through digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies.

(c)

Lifecycle solutions: The integration of John Deere&#8217;s aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product.

John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions were launched in 2022. These ambitions are designed to boost economic value and sustainability for John Deere&#8217;s customers. The ambitions align across the production systems of John Deere customers, seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. As an enabling business, we are fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and are focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions.

TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

Our volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products.

John Deere Trends 

Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. Integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend. The technologies that are the focus of John Deere&#8217;s operating model are incorporated into products within each of John Deere&#8217;s operating segments. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. 

&#8203; 

Agriculture and Turf Outlook for 2024 

&#9679; John Deere expects large and small agricultural equipment sales to be down from 2023 levels in North America, Europe, and South America. &#9679; Agricultural fundamentals across all of John Deere&#8217;s major markets are expected to moderate in 2024 due to rising global stocks, lower commodity prices, elevated interest rates, and weather volatility. In the U.S. and Canada, this is partially offset by resilient farm balance sheets. &#9679; The U.S. equipment fleet age is elevated for both tractors and combines. However, increases in used inventory levels are impacting purchasing decisions. &#9679; In Europe, the dairy and livestock sector is expected to improve due to stronger pricing amid lower feed costs while spring weather conditions have caused uncertainty about winter seeded crop yields. In addition, persistent, elevated input costs have decreased demand in Europe. &#9679; Due to macro-economic trends in U.S. consumer markets including lower levels of home sales, persistently higher interest rates, and inventory reductions, sales of compact utility tractors and riding lawn equipment continue to be lower. 

Construction and Forestry Outlook for 2024 

&#9679; Construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be flat to down from 2023 levels. &#9679; Benefits from increasing U.S. infrastructure spending, elevated manufacturing investment levels, and improving single family housing starts are expected to partially offset declines in commercial real estate construction and softening rental demand. &#9679; Roadbuilding demand remains strong in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe. 

Company Trends 

Our net income for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be higher than fiscal year 2023 primarily due to income earned on a higher average portfolio and lower dealer financing incentives, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads.

Agricultural Market Business Cycle. The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers&#8217; income and may result in lower demand for equipment. We may experience higher receivable write-offs and losses on equipment on operating leases during unfavorable market conditions.

Interest Rates. Central bank policy interest rates increased in 2023 and have remained elevated. Most of our receivables and leases with retail customers are fixed rate, while our wholesale receivables generally are variable rate. This Receivable and Lease portfolio is financed with fixed and variable rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching the interest rate characteristics of our portfolio with our funding sources. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure. 

Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from our Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, we experienced $25.0 (after-tax) less favorable financing spreads in the first six months of 2024 compared to 2023. We expect to continue experiencing spread compression in 2024, but at a moderating pace relative to spread compression experienced in 2023.

Higher interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside.

Other Items of Concern and Uncertainties 

Other items that could impact our results are: 

&#9679; global and regional political conditions, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East , &#9679; economic, tax, and trade policies, &#9679; new or retaliatory tariffs , &#9679; capital market disruptions, &#9679; foreign currency and capital control policies, &#9679; regulations and legislation regarding right to repair or right to modify, &#9679; weather conditions, 

&#8203; 

&#9679; marketplace adoption and monetization of technologies we have invested in, &#9679; John Deere&#8217;s and our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies, &#9679; changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, &#9679; delays or disruptions in John Deere&#8217;s supply chain, &#9679; significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, &#9679; volatility in the prices of many commodities, and &#9679; slower economic growth or recession.

Total revenues increased for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 primarily due to a 17 percent and 18 percent increase in average portfolio balances, respectively, and higher average financing rates. Net income for the quarter was lower than the same period in 2023 primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads, mostly offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances. Year-to-date net income was higher due to income earned on higher average portfolio balances and lower dealer financing incentives, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads.

&#8203; 

Higher average portfolio balances and higher average finance rates drove increased revenues across all products for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 compared to 2023. The change was most pronounced within wholesale receivables, due to an increase in average portfolio balances of 42 percent and 49 percent for the second quarter and first six months of 2024, respectively, due to higher dealer inventory levels.

Other income increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and intercompany receivables from John Deere. Year-to-date results also benefited from an international support payment from John Deere as a result of foreign exchange losses in Argentina due to currency devaluation.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $292.3 for the second quarter and $570.7 for the first six months of 2024, compared with $251.2 and $459.4 for the same periods last year, respectively. The increases were primarily due to increased compensation paid by John Deere on wholesale receivables and retail notes, driven by a higher interest rate environment, in addition to higher average portfolio balances. The international support payment from John Deere noted above also contributed to the year-to-date increase. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above.

&#8203; 

The increase in interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 was primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings to fund a larger portfolio. 

Administrative and operating expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 decreased compared to the same periods in 2023 due to lower dealer financing incentive program costs. Additionally, the results for the quarter were positively impacted by lower foreign exchange losses. However, the year-to-date results were partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses in Argentina due to currency devaluation in the first quarter of 2024.

The provision for credit losses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 compared with the same periods last year due to higher net write-offs on retail notes and revolving charge accounts and an increase in allowance, driven by higher expected losses on agricultural customer accounts as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions. The annualized provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the average balance of total Receivables, was .61 percent for the second quarter and .39 percent for the first six months of 2024, compared with .24 percent and .14 percent for the same periods last year, respectively.

&#8203; 

The provision for income taxes decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2024 primarily due to favorable discrete tax items and a lower effective tax rate. The decrease year-to-date was partially offset by the effect of higher pretax income.

Customer Receivables decreased $389.5 during the first six months of 2024 due to a seasonal decrease in revolving charge account receivables. Customer Receivables increased $3,421.5 compared to one year ago due to strong John Deere retail sales of new and used equipment. Wholesale receivables increased $3,364.5 in the first six months of 2024 and $3,814.2 compared to one year ago due to higher dealer inventory levels.

Total Receivables 30 days or more past due, non-performing Receivables, and the allowance for credit losses were as follows (as a percentage of the Receivables balance):

We monitor the credit quality of Receivables based on delinquency status. Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. We stop accruing finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing, which generally occurs once Receivables are 90 days past due. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. We measure expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining balance. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. While we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $132.0 at April 28, 2024, compared with $138.4 at October 29, 2023 and $131.7 at April 30, 2023. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease deposits from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in &#8220;Other income&#8221; when the dealer&#8217;s deposit account is charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in other income were $5.2 in the second quarter and $12.5 for the first six months of 2024, compared with $3.9 and $5.8 for the same periods last year, respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

See our critical accounting estimates discussed in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of our recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these estimates. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY &#8211; 2024 COMPARED WITH 2023 

We rely on our ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance our Receivable and Lease portfolios. We have access to global capital markets at a reasonable cost and our ability to meet our debt obligations is supported in several ways. Sources of liquidity include: 

&#9679; cash and cash equivalents, &#9679; the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, &#9679; the securitization of retail notes, &#9679; intercompany loans from John Deere, &#9679; our Receivable and Lease portfolio, which is self-liquidating in nature, and &#9679; bank lines of credit. 

We closely monitor our liquidity sources against the cash requirements and expect to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet our funding needs in the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months).

Net cash was used for investing activities during the first six months of 2024 primarily due to growth in the wholesale portfolio, which was funded primarily through external borrowings and cash provided by operating activities.

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $2,990.6 in the first six months of 2024 and increased $6,845.7 compared to a year ago, generally corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios. During the first six months of 2024, we issued $6,096.3 and retired $2,323.5 of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During the first six months of 2024, we also issued $1,879.8 and retired $1,899.6 of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $6,448.8. Our funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

We have a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). The facility was renewed in November 2023 with an expiration in November 2024 and with an increase in the total capacity or &#8220;financing limit&#8221; from $1,500.0 to $2,000.0. At April 28, 2024, $1,434.5 of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the facility. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless we and the banks agree to renew, we would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected.

Lines of Credit 

We have access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both us and Deere &#38; Company. 

Worldwide lines of credit were $10,631.3 at April 28, 2024, consisting primarily of: 

&#9679; a 364-day credit facility agreement of $5.0 billion, expiring in the second quarter of 2025 , 

&#9679; a credit facility agreement of $2.75 billion, expiring in the second quarter of 2028, and 

&#9679; a credit facility agreement of $2.75 billion, expiring in the second quarter of 2029. 

At April 28, 2024, $2,786.7 of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of us and John Deere were considered to constitute utilization. 

The credit agreements governing these lines of credit require us to maintain a consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods and our ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder&#8217;s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. The agreements are mutually extendable, and the annual facility fees are not significant.

&#8203; 

Debt Ratings 

Our ability to obtain funding is affected by our debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as our lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity. 

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to our unsecured debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are the same as those for John Deere and are as follows:
