 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

We are subject to various unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of our business, the most prevalent of which relate to retail credit matters. We believe the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
