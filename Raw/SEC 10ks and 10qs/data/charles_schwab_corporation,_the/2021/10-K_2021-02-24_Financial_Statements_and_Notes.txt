Schwab&#8217;s securities broker-dealers have over 400 domestic branch offices in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as locations in Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include CSC and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. Certain estimates relate to taxes on income, legal and regulatory reserves, and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as goodwill recognized, in business combinations. 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as &#8220;TD Ameritrade&#8221; or &#8220;TDA&#8221;). TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020. See Note 3 for additional information on our acquisition of TD Ameritrade. 

Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Beginning in 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in 2020, amortization of acquired intangible assets was reclassified from depreciation and amortization and presented separately in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in 2020, acquired intangible assets &#8211; net was reclassified from other assets and presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect these changes. Corresponding presentation changes have been made to the consolidated statements of cash flows and related notes. 

Principles of Consolidation 

Schwab evaluates all entities in which it has financial interests for consolidation, except for money market funds, which are specifically excluded from consolidation guidance. When an entity is evaluated for consolidation, Schwab determines whether its interest in the entity constitutes a controlling financial interest under either the variable interest entity (VIE) model or the voting interest entity (VOE) model. In evaluating whether Schwab&#8217;s interest in a VIE is a controlling financial interest, we consider whether our involvement in the context of the design, purpose, and risks of the VIE, as well as any involvement of related parties, provides us with (i) the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. If both of these conditions exist, then Schwab would be the primary beneficiary of that VIE and consolidate it. Based upon the assessments for all of our interests in VIEs, there are no 

- 71 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

cases where the Company is the primary beneficiary; therefore, we are not required to consolidate any VIEs. See Note 11 for further information about VIEs. Schwab consolidates all VOEs in which it has majority-voting interests. 

Investments in entities in which Schwab does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions of the entity. Investments in entities for which Schwab does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost and adjusted for impairment and observable price changes of the identical or similar investments of the same issuer (adjusted cost method), except for certain investments in qualified affordable housing projects which are accounted for under the proportional amortization method. All equity method, adjusted cost method, and proportional amortization method investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Revenue recognition 

Net interest revenue 

Net interest revenue is not within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606), because it is generated from financial instruments covered by various other areas of GAAP. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Our primary interest earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; segregated cash and investments; margin loans; investment securities; and bank loans. Fees earned and incurred on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by the Company&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiaries on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are also included in interest revenue and expense. 

Asset management and administration fees 

The majority of asset management and administration fees are generated through our proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Mutual fund and ETF service fees are charged for investment management, shareholder, and administration services provided to Schwab Funds &#174; and Schwab ETFs &#8482; , as well as recordkeeping, shareholder, and administration services provided to third-party funds. Advice solutions fees are charged for brokerage and asset management services provided to advice solutions clients. Both mutual fund and ETF service fees and advice solutions fees are earned and recognized over time. Fees are generally based on a percentage of the daily value of assets under management and are collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. 

Trading revenue 

Trading revenue is primarily generated through commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs, as well as order flow revenue. In late 2019, Schwab eliminated online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. Commissions revenue is earned when the trades are executed and collected when the trades are settled. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is recognized when the trades are executed and is collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. 

Bank deposit account fees 

Bank deposit account fees consist of revenues resulting from sweep programs offered to certain clients whereby uninvested client cash is swept off-balance sheet to FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions. The Company provides marketing, recordkeeping, and support services related to these sweep programs to the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions in exchange for bank deposit account fees. These revenues are based on floating and fixed yields as elected by the Company subject to certain requirements, less interest paid to clients and other applicable fees. Bank deposit account fees are earned and recognized over time and collected on a monthly basis.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

Other revenue 

Other revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Generally, the most significant portion of other revenue is exchange processing fees, which are comprised of fees the Company&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiaries charge clients to offset the exchange processing fees imposed on us by third-parties. Exchange processing fees are earned and collected when the trade is executed and are recognized gross of amounts remitted to the third-parties, which are included in other expenses. 

Unsatisfied performance obligations 

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606. The practical expedient applies to and is elected for contracts where we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Schwab considers all highly liquid investments that mature in three months or less from the time of acquisition and that are not segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, deposits with banks, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents also include balances that our banking subsidiaries maintain at the Federal Reserve. 

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes 

Pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations, Schwab maintains cash or qualified securities in segregated reserve accounts for the exclusive benefit of clients. Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes include resale agreements, which are collateralized by U.S. Government and agency securities. Resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. Under these resale agreements, the Company obtains collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned and the interest accrued. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization. Cash and investments segregated also include certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities. Certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. 

Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions under ASC 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses , in estimating an allowance for credit losses for resale agreements. This practical expedient can be applied for financial assets with collateral maintenance provisions requiring the borrower to continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing the financial assets as a result of fair value changes in the collateral. In accordance with the practical expedient, when the Company reasonably expects that borrowers (or counterparties, as applicable) will replenish the collateral as required, there is no expectation of credit losses when the collateral&#8217;s fair value is greater than the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, then credit losses are estimated only on the unsecured portion. 

Receivables from brokerage clients 

Receivables from brokerage clients include margin loans to securities brokerage clients and other trading receivables from clients. Margin loans are collateralized by client securities and are carried at the amount receivable, net of an allowance for credit losses. Collateral is required to be maintained at specified minimum levels at all times. The Company monitors margin levels and requires clients to provide additional collateral, or reduce margin positions, to meet minimum collateral requirements if the fair value of the collateral changes. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for margin loans. An allowance for credit losses on unsecured or partially secured receivables from brokerage clients is estimated based on the aging of those receivables. Unsecured balances due to confirmed fraud are reserved immediately. The Company&#8217;s policy is to charge off any delinquent margin loans, including the accrued interest on such loans, no later than at 90 days past due. Accrued interest charged off is recognized as credit loss expense and is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab to pledge collateralized securities in accordance with federal regulations. The collateral is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for receivables from brokerage clients and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.

Other securities owned at fair value 

Other securities owned are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. Unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. 

AFS investment securities 

AFS investment securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, other than losses related to credit factors, are reported, net of taxes, in AOCI included in stockholders&#8217; equity. Realized gains and losses from sales of AFS investment securities are determined using the specific-identification method and are included in other revenue. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the security. Where applicable, prepayments are accounted for as they occur (i.e., prepayments are not estimated). 

An AFS investment security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Management evaluates AFS investment securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the security impairment has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. This evaluation is performed quarterly on an individual security basis. 

The evaluation of whether credit loss exists is inherently judgmental. This evaluation considers multiple factors including: the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; our internal credit ratings; the security&#8217;s market implied credit spread; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer&#8217;s industry; and whether all scheduled principal and interest payments have been received. 

If management determines that the impairment of an AFS investment security (or a portion of the impairment) is related to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded for that security through a charge to earnings. The allowance for credit losses is measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of expected cash flows and is limited to the difference between amortized cost and the fair value of the security. The Company estimates credit losses on a discounted cash flow basis using the security&#8217;s effective interest rate. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded through earnings in the period of the change. 

If it is determined that the Company intends to sell the impaired security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before any anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses of that security will be written off and the amortized cost basis of the security will be written down to fair value with any incremental impairment recorded through earnings. 

The Company excludes accrued interest from the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the AFS investment securities for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment of the securities. AFS investment securities are placed on nonaccrual status on a timely basis and any accrued interest receivable is reversed through interest income. 

Securities borrowed and securities loaned 

Securities borrowed transactions require Schwab to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for securities; the receivables from these transactions are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For securities loaned, Schwab receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables. 

Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses 

Bank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is 

- 74 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is divided into two classes of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs. 

Schwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the existing portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level. 

PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower&#8217;s credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs. 

The methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral. 

Expected credit losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio (Estimated Current LTV) of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and LIBOR rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information, which includes current and forecasted conditions. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on our historical loss experience and market trends, both current and forecasted. The loss severity estimate used in the allowance for credit loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

The methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs. 

Management also estimates a liability for expected credit losses on the Company&#8217;s commitments to extend credit related to unused HELOCs and commitments to purchase first mortgages. See Note 15 for additional information on these commitments. The liability is calculated by applying the loss factors described above to the commitments expected to be funded and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for expected credit losses on these commitments and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented. 

Schwab considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). 

Nonaccrual, nonperforming and impaired loans 

First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of 

- 75 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets. 

Loan charge-offs 

The Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for credit losses and the loan balance. Our charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell. The Company&#8217;s policy for PALs is to charge off any delinquent loans no later than at 90 days past due. 

Equipment, office facilities, and property 

Equipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property include certain capitalized costs of acquired or internally developed software. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized when the costs relate to development of approved projects for our internal needs that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project and post-project activities are expensed as incurred. Equipment, office facilities, and property (other than land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows: 

##TABLE_START All equipment types and furniture 

3 to 10 years 

Buildings 40 years Building and land improvements 20 years Software 

3 to 10 years (1) 

Leasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or lease term ##TABLE_END

(1) Amortized over contractual term if less than three years . 

Equipment, office facilities, and property are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess, with the maximum charge limited to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Our annual impairment testing date is April 1 st . Schwab can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. A qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, and Company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities, and merger or acquisition activity. 

If the Company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill, or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, management estimates the fair values of each of the Company&#8217;s reporting units (defined as the Company&#8217;s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries, as well as a market capitalization analysis.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

Intangible assets 

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that best reflects their economic benefit. All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 

Low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments 

We account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if the applicable requirements are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of taxes on income. The carrying value of LIHTC investments is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Unfunded commitments related to LIHTC investments are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Leases 

The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and server equipment and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected to not record leases acquired in a business combination on the balance sheet if the remaining term as of the acquisition date is 12 months or less. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease liability may include payments that depend on a rate or index (such as the Consumer Price Index), measured using the rate or index at the commencement date. Payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date are considered variable. These payments are not recognized as part of the lease liability and are expensed in the period incurred. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For the majority of our leases (real estate leases), the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We have not elected the practical expedient for equipment leases and account for lease and non-lease components separately for those classes of leases. 

As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include periods covered by options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. The lease terms may also include periods covered by options to terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will not exercise that option. 

Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Advertising and market development 

Advertising and market development activities include the cost to produce and distribute marketing campaigns as well as client incentives and discounts. Such costs are generally expensed when incurred. 

Income taxes 

Schwab provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized. The effects of tax rate changes on future deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as other changes in income tax laws, are recorded in earnings in the period such changes are enacted. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated to determine whether they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. When tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination the difference between positions taken on tax return filings and estimated potential tax settlement outcomes are recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. If a position is not more likely than not to be 

- 77 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

sustained, then none of the tax benefit is recognized in Schwab&#8217;s financial statements. Accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in taxes on income. Schwab records amounts within AOCI net of taxes. Income tax effects are released from AOCI using the specific-identification method. 

Share-based compensation 

Share-based compensation includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock units. Schwab measures compensation expense for these share-based payment arrangements based on their estimated fair values as of the grant date. The fair value of the share-based award is recognized over the service period as share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense is based on options or units expected to vest and therefore is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Per the Company&#8217;s accounting policy election, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and reviewed annually based on the Company&#8217;s historical forfeiture experience. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures. The excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units are recorded in taxes on income. 

Fair values of assets and liabilities 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the fair value hierarchy for disclosing assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the inputs used to value them. The fair value hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are based on market pricing data obtained from third-party sources independent of the Company. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is generally used to measure fair value whenever available. 

Unobservable inputs reflect management&#8217;s judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Where inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or liability are from different levels of the hierarchy, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment. The fair value hierarchy includes three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets as of the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 

&#8226; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, new issue data, and collateral performance. 

&#8226; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

Schwab&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include: certain cash equivalents, certain investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, AFS securities, and certain other assets. The Company uses the market approach to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. 

Our primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices 

- 78 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar &#8220;to-be-issued&#8221; securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.

##TABLE_START Standard Description Date of Adoption Effects on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, &#8220;Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&#8221; Provides guidance for recognizing impairment of most debt instruments measured at amortized cost, including loans and HTM debt securities.

The initial estimate of, and the subsequent changes in, CECL will be recognized as credit loss expense through current earnings and will be reflected as an allowance for credit losses offsetting the carrying value of the financial instrument(s) on the balance sheet. Amends the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) model for AFS debt securities by requiring the use of an allowance, rather than directly reducing the carrying value of the security, and eliminating consideration of the length of time such security has been in an unrealized loss position as a factor in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Adoption requires modified retrospective transition through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the entity applies the new guidance except that a prospective transition is required for AFS debt securities for which an OTTI has been recognized prior to the effective date. January 1, 2020 The Company adopted CECL as of January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of CECL resulted in an immaterial increase in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses and an increase in the liability for expected credit losses on commitments to extend credit, both primarily related to First Mortgages and HELOCs. The adoption impact was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ASU 2018-15, &#8220;Intangibles&#8211; Goodwill and Other&#8211;Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)&#8221; Aligns the criteria for capitalizing implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements (CCA) that are service contracts with internal-use software that is developed or purchased and CCAs that include an internal-use software license. This guidance requires that the capitalized implementation costs be recognized over the period of the CCA service contract, subject to impairment evaluation on an ongoing basis. The guidance prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Adoption provides for retrospective or prospective application to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. January 1, 2020 The Company adopted this guidance prospectively on January 1, 2020. As such, adoption had no impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Historically, Schwab has expensed implementation costs as they are incurred for CCAs that are service contracts. Therefore, adopting this guidance changed the Company&#8217;s accounting treatment for these types of implementation costs prospectively from the adoption date. Standard Description Date of Adoption Effects on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters ASU 2020-4, &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting&#8221; Provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying existing accounting guidance to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met, including simplifying accounting analyses for contract modifications. This guidance only applies to the items listed above if they reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform and only for a limited period of time. When elected, the optional expedients for contract modifications must be applied consistently for all eligible contracts or eligible transactions subject to the same accounting guidance that would have otherwise been applied. Once elected, the amendments must be applied prospectively. N/A. Effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 The Company adopted this guidance prospectively as of October 1, 2020. There was no impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements upon initial adoption. ##TABLE_END 

There are no new accounting standards not yet adopted that are material to the Company as of December 31, 2020. 

3. Business Acquisitions 

TD Ameritrade 

On October 6, 2020 Schwab completed its previously announced acquisition of TD Ameritrade. As a result of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries, and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its FCM and FDM subsidiary. TD Ameritrade also provides cash sweep and deposit account products through the IDA agreement, as well as bank deposit account sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions. The Company anticipates this transaction will add scale to help support the Company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve its operating

efficiency. 

In exchange for each share of TD Ameritrade common stock, TD Ameritrade stockholders received 1.0837 shares of CSC common stock, except for TD Bank and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock. In connection with the transaction, Schwab issued approximately 586 million common shares to TD Ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately 509 million shares of common stock and approximately 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock, as described below. For further details on the new class of nonvoting common stock, see Note 19. 

Information regarding the acquisition is provisional and based on information that was available in the limited time since October 6, 2020. Due to the timing of the close of the acquisition, the information described below will be finalized in subsequent periods as prescribed in ASC 805, Business Combinations . 

The fair value of the purchase price transferred upon completion of the acquisition included the fair value of CSC common stock and nonvoting common stock that was issued to TD Ameritrade stockholders, as well as the fair value of assumed TD Ameritrade equity awards attributable to pre-combination services. 

The provisional purchase price was calculated as follows: 

##TABLE_START Fair value of consideration for TD Ameritrade outstanding common stock $ 21,664 &#160; 

Fair value of replaced TD Ameritrade equity awards attributable to pre-combination services (1) 

94 &#160; Provisional purchase price $ 21,758 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(1) Share-based awards held by TD Ameritrade employees prior to the acquisition date were assumed by Schwab and converted into share-based awards with respect to CSC common stock, after giving effect to the exchange ratio of 1.0837 . Such share-based awards are otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before the merger, except for performance-based restricted stock units which were converted into time-based restricted stock units. The portion of the fair value of the share-based awards that relates to services performed by the employees prior to the acquisition date is included in the purchase price. 

The Company accounted for the TD Ameritrade acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for certain exceptions to the recognition principle of acquisition accounting, such as leases, share-based payments, and income taxes, as of the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered provisional and are based on currently available information. The Company believes that the information available provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, these provisional estimates may be adjusted upon the availability of new information regarding facts and circumstances which existed at the acquisition date. The Company expects to finalize the valuation of assets and liabilities as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any adjustments to the initial estimates of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed will be recorded as adjustments to the respective assets and liabilities, with the residual amounts allocated to goodwill.

N/A Not applicable. 

The estimated fair values of real property, personal property, construction in progress, and land were determined using a sales comparison and cost approach, including consideration of functional and economic obsolescence. The Company estimated the weighted-average useful lives of the assets based on the current condition and expected future use of the assets. The estimated fair values of client relationships, existing technology, and trade names were estimated using a multi-period excess earnings approach, cost approach, and relief from royalty approach, respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset, and the relief from royalty method starts with a forecast of the royalties saved by the Company because it owns the asset. The forecasts are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow streams. The cost approach uses replacement cost as an indicator of fair value.

Goodwill of $ 10.2 billion is primarily attributable to the scale, skill sets, operations, and synergies that can be leveraged to enable the combined company to build a stronger enterprise and will not be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill assigned to the Investor Services and Advisor Services segments were $ 6.4 billion and $ 3.8 billion, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net income attributable to the TD Ameritrade acquisition of $ 1.7 billion and $ 583 million, respectively, for the period October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. 

In connection with the TD Ameritrade acquisition, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $ 56 million and $ 11 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services on the consolidated statements of income. 

Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited) 

The following table presents unaudited pro forma financial information as if the TD Ameritrade acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect after-tax adjustments for acquisition costs, amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible and tangible assets, the impact of the amended IDA agreement which reduced the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions to 15 basis points from the 25 basis points paid by TD Ameritrade under its previous IDA agreement, and other immaterial adjustments for the effects of purchase accounting, and do not reflect potential revenue growth or cost savings that may be realized as a result of the acquisition. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 excludes after-tax acquisition costs for both Schwab and TD Ameritrade of $ 115 million. These costs and after-tax acquisition costs of $ 30 million incurred in 2019 by Schwab and TD Ameritrade are included in pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of future operations or results had the TD Ameritrade acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2019.

USAA-IMCO 

On May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $ 1.6 billion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company&#8217;s operations through the addition of over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $ 80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA&#8217;s members through the long-term referral agreement. 

The Company accounted for the USAA-IMCO acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we made a $ 43 million post-closing adjustment to the purchase price resulting in reductions of $ 9 million and $ 34 million to our initial estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired and goodwill, respectively. The Company finalized the valuation of assets and liabilities during the three months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in no additional adjustments to the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.

(1) The brokerage referral agreement has an initial term of 5 years and is automatically renewable for one -year increments thereafter. 

The estimated fair values of client relationships, the brokerage referral agreement, and the royalty-free license were estimated using the multi-period excess earnings, with-and-without, and relief from royalty methods, respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset, and the relief from royalty method starts with a forecast of the royalties saved by the Company because it owns the asset. The with-and-without method quantifies the difference between forecasted cash flows with the asset and without the asset. The forecasts are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow streams. 

Goodwill recorded of $ 472 million, primarily attributable to the additional scale and anticipated synergies from the USAA-IMCO acquisition, was assigned to the Investor Services segment and is deductible for tax purposes. 

The Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net loss attributable to the USAA-IMCO acquisition of $ 235 million and $ 51 million, respectively, for the period May 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020. 

In connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to reimburse USAA for certain contract termination and other fees and severance costs incurred by USAA. These costs totaled $ 21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs related to the USAA-IMCO acquisition, such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $ 54 million and $ 14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services, other expense, and compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of income.

On January 1, 2019 the Company transferred certain U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $ 8.8 billion from the HTM category to the AFS category as permitted by ASU 2017-12, &#8220; Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities&#8221; (ASU 2017-12). This transfer resulted in a net of tax increase to AOCI of $ 19 million. 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final enhanced prudential standards rule, and the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC jointly issued a final regulatory capital and liquidity rule. With total consolidated assets of $ 294.0 billion at December 31, 2019, CSC is designated as a Category III firm pursuant to the framework established by the final rules. Accordingly, the Company opted to exclude AOCI from its regulatory capital as

permitted by the regulatory capital and liquidity rule beginning January 1, 2020. In accordance with ASC 320, Investment &#8211; Debt Securities and as of January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as HTM to the AFS category without tainting our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. At the date of transfer, these securities had a total amortized cost of $ 134.7 billion and a total net unrealized gain of $ 1.4 billion. 

At December 31, 2020, our banking subsidiaries had pledged securities with a fair value of $ 44.7 billion as collateral to secure borrowing capacity on secured credit facilities with the FHLB (see Note 13). Our banking subsidiaries also pledge investment securities as collateral to secure borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window, and had pledged securities with a fair value of $ 7.9 billion as collateral for this facility at December 31, 2020. The Company also pledges securities issued by federal agencies to secure certain trust deposits. The fair value of these pledged securities was $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, substantially all rated securities in the investment portfolios were investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. 

For a description of management&#8217;s quarterly evaluation of AFS securities in unrealized loss positions see Note 2. No amounts were recognized as credit loss expense and no securities were written down to fair value through earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020. None of the Company&#8217;s AFS securities held as of December 31, 2020 had an allowance for credit losses. No amounts were recognized as OTTI in earnings or other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, Schwab did not hold any securities on which OTTI was previously recognized. 

The Company had $ 634 million of accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2020 for AFS securities, and $ 471 million of accrued interest receivable for AFS and HTM securities as of December 31, 2019. These amounts are excluded from the amortized cost basis of AFS and HTM securities and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no write-offs of accrued interest receivable on AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, and no write-offs of accrued interest receivable on AFS securities or HTM securities during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Note: Substantially all of the bank loans were collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

(1) All PALs were fully collateralized by securities with fair values in excess of borrowings as of each period presented. 

Despite the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the continued uncertainty of the economic outlook, credit quality metrics and overall performance of the bank loan portfolios remained strong in 2020. The ACL increased from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, primarily due to growth in mortgage loan origination during the year, driven by the continued low interest rate environment, and also reflects management&#8217;s consideration of qualitative factors associated with the potential persistence and effects of COVID-19 on the economic recovery. At December 31, 2020, management&#8217;s reasonable and supportable forecast period extends through 2024, with limited growth in home prices anticipated over the near term and unemployment expected to remain above 5% through the end of 2022.

Credit Quality 

In addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following: 

&#8226; Year of origination; 

&#8226; Borrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO); 

&#8226; Updated borrower FICO scores (Updated FICO); 

&#8226; Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at origination (Origination LTV); and 

&#8226; Estimated Current LTV ratios. 

Borrowers&#8217; FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC&#8217;s origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.

At December 31, 2020, First Mortgage loans of $ 12.9 billion had adjustable interest rates. Substantially all of these mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 26 % of the balance of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 77 % of the balance of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. Schwab&#8217;s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Schwab had $ 43 million and $ 46 million, respectively, of accrued interest on bank loans, which is excluded from the amortized cost basis of bank loans and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

The HELOC product has a 30 -year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20 -year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20 -year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. 

The following table presents HELOCs converted to amortizing loans during each period presented: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2020 2019 HELOCs converted to amortizing loans $ 26 &#160; $ 44 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans:

At December 31, 2020, $ 664 million of the HELOC portfolio was secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans typically possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described previously, Schwab also monitors credit risk by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. At December 31, 2020, the borrowers on approximately 52 % of HELOC loan balances outstanding only paid the minimum amount due.

See Note 3 for additional information on the Company&#8217;s acquisitions. 

As of our annual testing date, we performed an assessment of each of the Company&#8217;s reporting units. Based on this analysis we concluded that goodwill was not impaired. There were no indicators that goodwill was impaired after our annual testing date. Schwab did no t recognize any goodwill impairment in any of the years presented.

(1) Primarily CRA-related, including LIHTC investments; also includes investments in FHLB stock of $ 29 million and $ 35 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which can only be sold to the issuer at its par value. Any cash dividends received from investments in FHLB stock are recognized as interest revenue in the consolidated statements of income. During 2020, CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve and as a condition of membership, are required to hold Federal Reserve Stock. As such, other investments also includes investments in FRB stock of $ 191 million at December 31, 2020. 

Capitalized contract costs 

Capitalized contract costs relate to incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including sales commissions paid to employees for obtaining contracts with clients. These costs are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over a period that is consistent with how the related revenue is recognized. Capitalized contract costs were $ 303 million and $ 281 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized contract costs was $ 63 million and $ 55 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was recorded in compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income. 

11. Variable Interest Entities 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of Schwab&#8217;s involvement with VIEs is through CSB&#8217;s CRA-related investments and most of those are related to LIHTC investments. As part of CSB&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives, CSB invests in funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties and receives tax credits and other tax benefits for these investments. During 2020 and 2019, CSB recorded amortization of $ 56 million and $ 39 million, respectively, and recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $ 69 million and $ 47 million, respectively, associated with these investments. The amortization, as well as the tax credits and other tax benefits, are included in taxes on income.

(1) Aggregate assets and aggregate liabilities are included in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

(2) Other CRA investments are accounted for as loans at amortized cost, equity method investments, AFS securities, or using the adjusted cost method. Aggregate assets are included in AFS securities, bank loans &#8211; net, or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Schwab&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss would result from the loss of the investments, including any committed amounts. CSB&#8217;s funding of these remaining commitments is dependent upon the occurrence of certain conditions, and CSB expects to pay substantially all of these commitments between 2021 and 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Schwab did not provide or intend to provide financial or other support to the VIEs that it was not contractually required to provide.

Short-term borrowings: Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the amount of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of their investment securities that are pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the collateral pledged provided a total borrowing capacity of $ 55.1 billion and $ 34.2 billion, respectively, of which no amounts were outstanding at the end of either year. 

As a condition of the FHLB borrowings, we are required to hold FHLB stock, which was recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investment in FHLB stock was $ 29 million and $ 35 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Additionally, our banking subsidiaries have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available are dependent upon the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the collateral pledged provided total borrowing capacity of $ 7.9 billion and $ 8.5 billion, respectively, of which no amounts were outstanding at the end of either year. 

During 2020, CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve. As a condition of our Federal Reserve membership, we are required to hold Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $ 191 million at December 31, 2020. 

TD Ameritrade Lines of Credit and Revolving Credit Facilities 

TDAC maintains secured uncommitted lines of credit, under which TDAC borrows on either a demand or short-term basis and pledges client margin securities as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under the secured uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2020. 

TDAC has access to two senior unsecured committed revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $ 1.5 billion, consisting of an $ 850 million senior revolving credit facility and a $ 600 million senior revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2021 and April 2022, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under the TDAC senior revolving facilities as of December 31, 2020. 

TDA Holding had access to a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $ 300 million. On October 6, 2020, Schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of TD Ameritrade under this credit agreement. The provision of the guaranty supplement by Schwab was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement. There were no borrowings outstanding under the TDA Holding revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020, and effective January 28, 2021, the Company terminated the TDA Holding revolving credit facility.

Guarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation &#8211; a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $ 15 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2020. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral. 

The Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company&#8217;s liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees. 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company acquired TD Ameritrade. The TD Ameritrade broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries&#8217; operations include the execution, settlement, and financing of various client securities, options, futures and foreign exchange transactions. These activities may expose the Company to credit risk and losses in the event the clients are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. TD Ameritrade is a member of and provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements. TD Ameritrade also engages third-party firms to clear clients&#8217; futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients&#8217; foreign exchange trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any loss that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by TD Ameritrade. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees. 

IDA agreement: The Company&#8217;s IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective on October 6, 2020. The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts must be swept off-balance sheet to money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides marketing, recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee, determined by reference to certain yields, less a service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions, FDIC deposit assessments, and interest on deposits paid to clients. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions. 

Pursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will be required to move all uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $ 10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company&#8217;s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. The amount of Schwab&#8217;s initial potential transfer will also be affected by the net growth or decline in the IDA balance from immediately prior to the October 6, 2020 effective date of the IDA agreement through June 30, 2021. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $ 50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80 % of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

The total ending IDA balance was $ 144.6 billion as of October 5, 2020, and $ 154.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program. 

Legal contingencies: Schwab is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. 

Predicting the outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is inherently difficult, requiring significant judgment and evaluation of various factors, including the procedural status of the matter and any recent developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases; available defenses, including potential opportunities to dispose of a case on the merits or procedural grounds before trial (e.g., motions to dismiss or for summary judgment); the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts regarding potential damages; and potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions. It may not be reasonably possible to estimate a range of potential liability until the matter is closer to resolution &#8211; pending, for example, further proceedings, the outcome of key motions or appeals, or discussions among the parties. Numerous issues may have to be developed, such as discovery of important factual matters and determination of threshold legal issues, which may include novel or unsettled questions of law. Reserves are established or adjusted or further disclosure and estimates of potential loss are provided as the matter progresses and more information becomes available. 

Schwab believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is contesting liability and any damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation. Described below are matters in which there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred or where the matter may otherwise be of significant interest to stockholders. Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of any potential liability given the stage of proceedings in the matter. With respect to all other pending matters, based on current information and consultation with counsel, it does not appear reasonably possible that the outcome of any such matter would be material to the financial condition, operating results, or cash flows of the Company. 

Crago Order Routing Litigation : On July 13, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a putative class of customers executing equity orders through CS&#38;Co. The lawsuit names CS&#38;Co and CSC as defendants and alleges that an agreement under which CS&#38;Co routed orders to UBS Securities LLC between July 13, 2011 and December 31, 2014 violated CS&#38;Co&#8217;s duty to seek best execution. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, interest, injunctive and equitable relief, and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. After a first amended complaint was dismissed with leave to amend, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2017. Defendants again moved to dismiss, and in a decision issued December 5, 2017, the court denied the motion. Defendants have answered the complaint to deny all allegations, and are vigorously contesting the lawsuit. 

Ford Order Routing Litigation : On September 15, 2014, TDA Holding, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and its former CEO, Frederick J. Tomczyk, were sued on behalf of a putative class of TD Ameritrade, Inc. clients alleging that defendants failed to seek best execution and made misrepresentations and omissions regarding its order routing practices. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and injunctive and other relief. On September 14, 2018, the District Court granted plaintiff&#8217;s motion for class certification, and defendants petitioned for an immediate appeal of the District Court&#8217;s class certification decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, granted defendants&#8217; petition on December 18, 2018, and a decision on defendants&#8217; appeal is pending. Defendants are vigorously contesting the lawsuit, and the Company is unable to predict the outcome or the potential loss, if any, that may result. 

TD Ameritrade Acquisition Litigation : As disclosed previously, Schwab and TD Ameritrade have been responding to a lawsuit challenging the acquisition which was filed on May 12, 2020 in the Delaware Court of Chancery (Hawkes v. Bettino et al.) on behalf of a proposed class of TD Ameritrade&#8217;s stockholders, excluding, among others, TD Bank. The initial complaint named as defendants each member of the TD Ameritrade board of directors at the time the acquisition was approved, as well as TD Bank and Schwab. On June 11, 2020, plaintiff dismissed a claim that had sought to enjoin voting on or consummation of the acquisition. On February 5, 2021, plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming an officer and certain directors of TD Ameritrade at the time the acquisition was approved, as well as TD Bank, certain TD Bank related entities, and Schwab. The amended complaint asserts separate claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the TD Ameritrade officer, certain members of the TD Ameritrade board and TD Bank, and against Schwab for aiding and abetting such

breaches, the allegation being that the amendment of the Insured Deposit Account Agreement TD Bank negotiated directly with Schwab allowed TD Bank to divert merger consideration from TD Ameritrade&#8217;s minority public stockholders. Plaintiff seeks to recover monetary damages, costs and attorneys&#8217; fees. Schwab and the other defendants consider the allegations to be entirely without merit and are contesting the remaining claims in the lawsuit. 

16. Exit and Other Related Liabilities 

The integration of TD Ameritrade&#8217;s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 acquisition date. To achieve our integration objectives, the Company expects to recognize significant additional acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures throughout the integration process. Such acquisition and integration-related costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, costs for technology enhancements, and compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work. 

The Company&#8217;s acquisition and integration-related spending also includes exit and other related costs, such as severance and other employee termination benefits, retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures, including accelerated depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations. Exit and other related costs are a component of the Company&#8217;s overall acquisition and integration-related spending, and support the Company&#8217;s ability to achieve integration objectives including expected synergies. 

The Company is in the early stages of integration, and our estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs are subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, and increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Inclusive of costs recognized in 2020, Schwab currently expects to incur total exit and other related costs for the integration of TD Ameritrade ranging from $ 650 million to $ 1 billion, consisting of employee compensation and benefits, facility exit costs, and certain other costs. During 2020, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $ 186 million for acquisition-related exit costs. The Company expects the remaining exit and other related costs be incurred and charged to expense over the next 15 to 33 months. In addition to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , certain of the costs associated with these activities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment , ASC 712 Compensation &#8211; Nonretirement Post Employment Benefits , ASC 718 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation , and ASC 842 Leases . 

The following is a summary of the activity in the Company&#8217;s exit and other related liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020:

(1) Costs related to facility closures. These costs, which are comprised of accelerated amortization of ROU assets and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, relate to the impact of abandoning leased and other properties. 

17. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk 

Resale agreements: Schwab enters into collateralized resale agreements principally with other broker-dealers, which could result in losses in the event the counterparty fails to purchase the securities held as collateral for the cash advanced and the fair value of the securities declines. To mitigate this risk, Schwab requires that the counterparty deliver securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a fair value at or in excess of the resale price. Schwab also sets standards for the credit quality of the counterparty, monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest, and requires additional collateral where deemed appropriate. The collateral provided under these resale agreements is utilized to meet obligations under broker-dealer client protection rules, which place limitations on our ability to access such segregated securities. For Schwab to repledge or sell this collateral, we would be required to deposit cash and/or securities of an equal amount into our segregated reserve bank accounts in order to meet our segregated cash and investment requirement. Schwab&#8217;s resale agreements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not subject to master netting arrangements. 

Securities lending: Schwab loans brokerage client securities temporarily to other brokers and clearing houses in connection with its securities lending activities and receives cash as collateral for the securities loaned. Increases in security prices may cause the fair value of the securities loaned to exceed the amount of cash received as collateral. In the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the loaned securities or provide additional cash collateral, we may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy our client obligations. Schwab mitigates this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, monitoring the fair value of securities loaned, and requiring additional cash as collateral when necessary. In addition, most of our securities lending transactions are through a program with a clearing organization, which guarantees the return of cash to us. We also borrow securities from other broker-dealers to fulfill short sales by brokerage clients and deliver cash to the lender in exchange for the securities. The fair value of these borrowed securities was $ 852 million and $ 719 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our securities lending transactions are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements with other broker-dealers; however, we do not net securities lending transactions. Therefore, the securities loaned and securities borrowed are presented gross in the consolidated balance sheets.

(4) Included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The cash collateral received from counterparties under securities lending transactions was equal to or greater than the market value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

(5) Securities loaned are predominantly comprised of equity securities held in client brokerage accounts with overnight and continuous remaining contractual maturities. 

Client trade settlement: Schwab is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if our clients fail to meet their obligations to us. Clients are required to complete their transactions on settlement date, generally two business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, we may incur losses. We have established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades, and therefore the potential to make payments under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.

19. Stockholders&#8217; Equity 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company issued shares of CSC common stock and a new, nonvoting class of CSC common stock. Immediately prior to the acquisition, on October 6, 2020, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to create the nonvoting class of common stock with 300 million shares authorized for issuance and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock by the same amount. Each share of nonvoting common stock has identical rights, including liquidation and dividend rights, except that holders of nonvoting common stock have no voting rights other than over matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the nonvoting common stock, or as required by applicable law. Holders of nonvoting common stock are restricted from transferring shares except for permitted inside or outside transfers, as defined in the certificate of incorporation. Shares of nonvoting stock transferred in a permitted outside transfer are automatically converted to shares of common stock. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSC issued approximately 177 million shares of common stock and approximately 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates on October 6, 2020. Those shares of common stock and nonvoting common stock were issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Following this issuance, TD Bank exchanged an aggregate of approximately 2 million shares of CSC common stock for an equal number of shares of CSC nonvoting common stock and held approximately 79 million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2020. TD Bank and its affiliates are not permitted to own more than 9.9 % of CSC common stock. This limit is interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve and includes shares of CSC common stock deemed to be beneficially owned directly or indirectly by TD Bank and its affiliates. 

CSC did no t issue any shares of common stock through external offerings during 2019 or 2018. 

On December 11, 2020, the Company issued and sold 2,500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 4.000 % fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series H, $ .01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $ 100,000 per share (equivalent of $ 1,000 per Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $ 2.47 billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. 

On April 30, 2020, the Company issued and sold 2,500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 5.375 % fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series G, $ .01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $ 100,000 per share (equivalent of $ 1,000 per Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $ 2.47 billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. 

On January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $ 4.0 billion of common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. There were no repurchases of CSC&#8217;s common stock under this authorization during the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2019, CSC repurchased 55 million shares of its common stock under this authorization for $ 2.2 billion. 

On October 25, 2018, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors terminated the previous two share repurchase authorizations and replaced them with an authorization to repurchase up to $ 1.0 billion of common stock. CSC repurchased 22 million shares for $ 1.0 billion in 2018, completing all repurchases under this authorization.

21. Employee Incentive, Retirement, Deferred Compensation, and Career Achievement Plans 

Schwab&#8217;s share-based incentive plans provide for granting options and restricted stock units to employees and directors. In addition, we offer retirement and employee stock purchase plans to eligible employees and sponsor deferred compensation plans for eligible officers and non-employee directors. 

Acquisition of TD Ameritrade 

Upon the completion of the TD Ameritrade acquisition on October 6, 2020, TD Ameritrade&#8217;s equity awards, whether vested or unvested, were assumed by the Company and converted into equity awards based on CSC common stock taking into account the defined exchange ratio of 1.0837 . Otherwise, these share-based awards are subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable immediately before the merger, except for performance-based restricted stock units which were converted into time-based restricted stock units. The fair value of the stock options assumed by the Company was determined using an option pricing model. The portion of the fair value of the replacement awards related to services provided prior to the acquisition was $ 94 million and was accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining portion of the fair value of $ 73 million is associated with future services and had a remaining weighted-average service period of 1.9 years on the acquisition date. A change in the actual or estimated forfeiture rate from the amount originally or subsequently estimated will result in an adjustment to compensation expense based on the full acquisition-date fair value of

The Company issues shares for stock options and restricted stock units from treasury stock. At December 31, 2020, the Company was authorized to grant up to 62 million common shares under its existing stock incentive plans. Additionally, at December 31, 2020, the Company had 32 million shares reserved for future issuance under its employee stock purchase plan. 

As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 289 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized through 2024 with a remaining weighted-average service period of 0.9 years for stock options, 2.2 years for restricted stock units, and 0.4 years for performance-based stock units. 

Stock Option Plan 

Options are granted for the purchase of shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options generally vest annually over a one - to four -year period from the date of grant.

Information on stock options granted and exercised is presented below: 

##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Weighted-average fair value of options granted per share $ 11.56 &#160; $ 11.97 &#160; $ 14.16 &#160; Cash received from options exercised 79 &#160; 118 &#160; 125 &#160; Tax benefit realized on options exercised 11 &#160; 17 &#160; 35 &#160; Aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised 71 &#160; 108 &#160; 189 &#160; ##TABLE_END

We use an option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The model takes into account the contractual term of the stock option, expected volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of publicly-traded options on CSC&#8217;s stock. Dividend yield is based on the average historical CSC dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term similar to the contractual term of the option. We use historical option exercise data, which includes employee termination data, to estimate the probability of future option exercises. The assumptions used to value the options granted during the years presented and their expected lives were as follows: 

##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Weighted-average expected dividend yield 2.08 &#160; % 1.85 &#160; % 1.42 &#160; % Weighted-average expected volatility 36 &#160; % 30 &#160; % 33 &#160; % Weighted-average risk-free interest rate 1.0 &#160; % 2.5 &#160; % 3.0 &#160; % Expected life (in years) 4.3 - 5.9

Restricted Stock Units 

Restricted stock units are awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of CSC&#8217;s common stock following a vesting period. Restricted stock units are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a one - to four -year period, while performance-based restricted stock units also require the Company achieve certain financial or other measures prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of the restricted stock units that vested during each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $ 175 million, $ 123 million, and $ 166 million, respectively.

Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans 

Employees can participate in Schwab&#8217;s qualified retirement plan, the SchwabPlan Retirement Savings and Investment Plan. The Company may match certain employee contributions or make additional contributions to this plan at its discretion. The Company&#8217;s total expense was $ 136 million, $ 118 million, and $ 105 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Schwab&#8217;s deferred compensation plan for officers permits participants to defer the receipt of certain cash compensation. The deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors permits participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their director fees and to receive either a grant of stock options, or upon ceasing service as a director, the number of shares of CSC&#8217;s common stock that would have resulted from investing the deferred fee amount into CSC&#8217;s common stock. The deferred compensation liability was $ 176 million and $ 164 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Effective upon the completion of the TD Ameritrade acquisition on October 6, 2020, TD Ameritrade&#8217;s 401(k) and deferred profit-sharing plans were terminated and TD Ameritrade employees were eligible to participate in the SchwabPlan Retirement Savings and Investment Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were no TD Ameritrade participants in Schwab&#8217;s deferred compensation plan. 

FC Career Achievement Plan 

&#160; 

The FC career achievement plan is a noncontributory, unfunded, nonqualified plan for eligible FCs. An FC is eligible for earned cash payments after retirement contingent upon meeting certain performance levels, tenure, age, and client transitioning requirements. Allocations to the plan are calculated annually based on performance levels achieved and eligible compensation and are subject to general creditors of the Company. Full vesting occurs when an FC reaches 60 years of age and has at least ten years of service with the Company.

During 2020, CSB, CSC&#8217;s primary depository institution subsidiary, converted to a Texas-chartered state savings bank and became a member of the Federal Reserve system. CSB is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the Federal Reserve, the TDSML, the FDIC as its deposit insurer, and the CFPB. CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for CSB. 

CSB is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital requirements and requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit to, or asset purchases from CSC or its other subsidiaries by CSB. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the Federal Reserve and the TDSML to declare dividends to CSC. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, CSB could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories. CSC and CSB are required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on CSC and CSB. At December 31, 2020, both CSC and CSB met all of their respective capital requirements.

(1) In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. 

(2) Under the Basel III capital rule, CSC and CSB are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer were 2.5% and zero percent, respectively, for both periods presented. If either buffer falls below the minimum requirement, the Company would be subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2020, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively. 

N/A Not applicable. 

Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020, CSB is considered well capitalized (the highest category) under its respective regulatory capital rules. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2020 that management believes have changed CSB&#8217;s capital category. 

Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve eliminated a requirement that depository institutions maintain reserve balances at the Federal Reserve based on deposits considered to be transaction accounts. CSB&#8217;s average required reserve pursuant to this regulation was $ 1.5 billion in 2019. In 2018, the Company established Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank) as a Nevada state-chartered savings bank to provide certain trust and custody services. At December 31, 2020, the balance sheets of CSPB and Trust Bank consisted primarily of investment securities, and the entities held total assets of $ 31.6 billion and $ 12.5 billion, respectively. Based on their regulatory capital ratios, at December 31, 2020, CSPB and Trust Bank are considered well capitalized under their respective regulatory capital rules.

During 2020, CS&#38;Co registered as an FCM with the CFTC, and subsequently, Charles Schwab Futures, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC, transferred its futures business and all of its assets and liabilities to CS&#38;Co. This transfer was accounted for as a common control transaction and did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

As a securities broker-dealer, CS&#38;Co is subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule, and as an FCM, CS&#38;Co is also subject to net capital requirements under CFTC Regulation 1.17 under the Commodity Exchange Act. CS&#38;Co computes net capital under the alternative method permitted by the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement, which is based on the type of business conducted by CS&#38;Co. CFTC Regulation 1.17 requires maintenance of adjusted net capital equal to or in excess of the greater of (1) $1.0 million; (2) its futures risk-based capital requirement, equal to 8% of the total risk margin requirement for all futures positions carried by the FCM in client and nonclient accounts; (3) the amount of adjusted net capital required by a registered futures association of which it is a member; or (4) for securities brokers and dealers, the amount of net capital required by the Uniform Net Capital Rule. 

Certain subsidiaries of TDA Holding are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including TDAC and TD Ameritrade, Inc. TDAC and TD Ameritrade, Inc. are subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule and compute net capital under the alternative method. TDAC is required to maintain net capital of the greater of $1.5 million, which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer, or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions. TD Ameritrade, Inc. is required to maintain minimum net capital, as defined, as the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement of $250,000, which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. 

Under the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not repay subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends, or make any unsecured advances or loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement. 

Net capital and net capital requirements for CS&#38;Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are as follows: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2020 2019 CS&#38;Co Net capital $ 3,117 &#160; $ 3,700 &#160; Minimum dollar requirement 1.000 &#160; 0.250 &#160; 2% of aggregate debit balances 616 &#160; 446 &#160; Net capital in excess of required net capital $ 2,501 &#160; $ 3,254 &#160; TDAC Net capital $ 4,040 &#160; N/A Minimum dollar requirement 1.500 &#160; N/A 2% of aggregate debit balances 748 &#160; N/A Net capital in excess of required net capital $ 3,292 &#160; N/A TD Ameritrade, Inc.

N/A Not applicable. Net capital amounts and requirements are not presented for TDAC and TD Ameritrade, Inc. prior to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. 

Pursuant to the SEC&#8217;s Customer Protection Rule and other applicable regulations, Schwab had cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients at December 31, 2020. The SEC&#8217;s Customer Protection Rule requires broker-dealers to segregate client fully-paid securities and cash balances not collateralizing margin positions and not swept to money market funds or bank deposit accounts. Amounts included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes represent actual balances on deposit, whereas cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2020 for CS&#38;Co totaled $ 39.2 billion and for TDAC totaled $ 14.5 billion. As of January 5, 2021, CS&#38;Co had deposited $ 4.8 billion of cash and qualified securities into its segregated reserve

accounts. As of January 4, 2021, TDAC had withdrawn $ 164 million of cash and qualified securities from its segregated reserve accounts. Cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2019 for CS&#38;Co totaled $ 23.0 billion. Cash and cash equivalents included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes are presented as part of Schwab&#8217;s cash balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 

24. Segment Information 

Schwab&#8217;s two reportable segments are Investor Services and Advisor Services. Schwab structures the operating segments according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. 

The Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client. See Note 3 for more information regarding business acquisitions. 

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. For the computation of its segment information, Schwab utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues. 

Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. There are no revenues from transactions between the segments. 

Financial information for the segments is presented in the following table:

25. Earnings Per Common Share 

EPS is computed using the two-class method. Preferred stock dividends, and undistributed earnings and dividends allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income available to common stockholders. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated similar to basic EPS except that the numerator and denominator are adjusted as necessary for any effects of dilutive potential common shares, which include, if dilutive, outstanding stock options and non-vested restricted stock units. 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had voting and nonvoting common stock outstanding. Since the rights of the voting and nonvoting common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, the net income of the Company has been allocated on a proportionate basis to the two classes. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and non-vested restricted stock units and the if-converted method for nonvoting common stock. The if-converted method assumes conversion of all nonvoting common stock to common stock. 

EPS under the basic and diluted computations for both common stock and nonvoting common stock are as follows:

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Charles Schwab Corporation: 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders ' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

As described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting , management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (TD Ameritrade), which was acquired on October 6, 2020, and whose financial information constitute 14% of the Company&#8217;s total assets, 15% of revenues, and 18% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at TD Ameritrade. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 

- 128 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Asset Management and Administration Fees (AMAF) &#8211; Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

Certain revenues included in asset management and administrative fees are generated through third-party mutual fund and exchange-traded funds (ETF) offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. These AMAF revenues are made up of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, and use automated systems to process and record these transactions based on underlying information sourced from multiple systems and contractual terms with individual investors and third-party mutual funds. 

Given that the Company&#8217;s process to record revenue is highly automated and involves multiple systems and databases, auditing these revenue streams was complex and challenging due to the extent of audit effort required and involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (IT) necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company&#8217;s systems, software applications, and automated controls. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the Company&#8217;s systems to process the AMAF revenue transactions included the following, among others: 

&#8226; With the assistance of our IT specialists, we: 

&#9702; Identified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and, using a risk-based approach, tested the relevant general IT controls over each of these systems. 

&#9702; Performed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls (including batch processing) within the relevant revenue streams. 

&#8226; We tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company&#8217;s general ledger. 

&#8226; We created data visualizations to evaluate recorded revenue and evaluate trends in the revenue data. 

&#8226; For a sample of revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to contractual agreements and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue. 

&#8226; For a sample of accounts, we tested the accuracy and completeness of assets under management by obtaining independent pricing support and reconciling total positions to third-party statements. 

Purchase Price Accounting for the TD Ameritrade Acquisition &#8211; Client Relationship Intangible Asset &#8211; Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

On October 6, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of TD Ameritrade for approximately $22 billion in common stock. The Company accounted for the TD Ameritrade acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, including client relationship intangible assets of $8.7 billion. The estimated fair value of client relationships were estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method starts 

- 129 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset. The forecast is then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow stream. 

Given the fair value determination of client relationship intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the determination of net future cash flows, and the selection of the respective discount rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the determination of net future cash flows and the selection of the discount rate relating to the client relationship intangible assets included the following, among others: 

&#8226; We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the determination of forecasted net future cash flows, selection of the discount rate and the valuation methodology used. 

&#8226; We assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management&#8217;s valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed. 

&#8226; With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies used and (2) discount rate by: 

&#9702; Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. 

&#9702; Developing a range of independent estimates of the discount rate and comparing to the discount rate utilized by management. 

&#8226; When assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to net future cash flows for client relationship intangible assets, we evaluated whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the acquired company and the Company&#8217;s strategic plan going forward. 

&#8226; We evaluated whether the assumptions used to estimate net future cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management of The Charles Schwab Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (the Company), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of and effected by the Company&#8217;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As of December 31, 2020, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff guidance, this assessment has excluded TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (TD Ameritrade), as described below. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Due to the significance of the acquisition and the complexity of TD Ameritrade&#8217;s systems and business processes, management&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 excludes TD Ameritrade from that assessment. TD Ameritrade&#8217;s assets represented approximately 14% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and its revenues and net income for the period from the acquisition through December 31, 2020 represented approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s consolidated total net revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. 

The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the previous pages.
