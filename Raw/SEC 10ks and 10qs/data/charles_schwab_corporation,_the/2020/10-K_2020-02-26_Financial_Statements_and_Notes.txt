Introduction and Basis of Presentation 

##TABLE_END 

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. CSC was incorporated in 1986 and engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. 

Principal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. (CS&#38;Co) is a securities broker-dealer with over 360 domestic branch offices in 48 states, as well as a branch in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In addition, Schwab serves clients through branch offices in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Hong Kong through other subsidiaries of CSC; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Charles Schwab Bank (CSB), our principal banking entity; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds &#174; ) and for Schwab&#8217;s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs&#8482;). 

##TABLE_END 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include CSC and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. Certain estimates relate to taxes on income and legal and regulatory reserves. 

Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets in prior periods in the line items Receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and Other securities owned are now presented as part of Other assets. Amounts presented in prior periods as Payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations are now presented as part of Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Corresponding presentation changes have been made to the consolidated statements of cash flows and related notes. 

Principles of Consolidation 

Schwab evaluates all entities in which it has financial interests for consolidation, except for money market funds, which are specifically excluded from consolidation guidance. When an entity is evaluated for consolidation, Schwab determines whether its interest in the entity constitutes a controlling financial interest under either the variable interest entity (VIE) model or the voting interest entity (VOE) model. In evaluating whether Schwab&#8217;s interest in a VIE is a controlling financial interest, we consider whether our involvement in the context of the design, purpose, and risks of the VIE, as well as any involvement of related parties, provides us with (i) the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. If both of these conditions exist, then Schwab would be the primary beneficiary of that VIE, and consolidate it. Based upon the assessments for all of our interests in VIEs, there are no cases where the Company is the primary beneficiary; therefore, we are not required to consolidate any VIEs. See Note 10 for further information about VIEs. Schwab consolidates all VOEs in which it has majority-voting interests. 

Investments in entities in which Schwab does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions of the entity. Investments in entities for which Schwab does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost and adjusted for impairment and observable price changes of the identical or similar investments of the same issuer (adjusted cost method), except for certain investments in qualified affordable housing projects which are accounted for under the proportional amortization method. All equity method, adjusted cost method, and proportional amortization method investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

##TABLE_START 2. 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

##TABLE_END 

Revenue recognition 

Net interest revenue 

Net interest revenue is not within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606), because it is generated from financial instruments covered by various other areas of GAAP. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Our primary interest earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; segregated cash and investments; margin loans; investment securities; and bank loans. Fees earned and incurred on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by CS&#38;Co on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are also included in interest revenue and expense. 

Unsatisfied performance obligations 

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606. The practical expedient applies to and is elected for contracts where we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. 

Asset management and administration fees 

The majority of asset management and administration fees are generated through our proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Mutual fund and ETF service fees are charged for investment management, shareholder, and administration services provided to Schwab Funds &#174; and Schwab ETFs&#8482;, as well as recordkeeping, shareholder, and administration services provided to third-party funds. Advice solutions fees are charged for brokerage and asset management services provided to advice solutions clients. Both mutual fund and ETF service fees and advice solutions fees are earned and recognized over time. Fees are generally based on a percentage of the daily value of assets under management and are collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. 

Trading revenue 

Substantially all trading revenue is generated through commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs. This revenue is earned when the trades are executed and collected when the trades are settled. Effective October 7, 2019, CS&#38;Co eliminated online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. 

Other revenue 

Other revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from our portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and nonrecurring gains. Generally, the most significant portion of other revenue is order flow revenue, which is comprised of rebate payments received from execution venues to which CS&#38;Co sends equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is recognized when the trades are executed and is collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Schwab considers all highly liquid investments that mature in three months or less from the time of acquisition and that are not segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, deposits with banks, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents also include balances that our banking subsidiaries maintain at the Federal Reserve. 

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes 

Pursuant to the SEC&#8217;s Customer Protection Rule and other applicable regulations, Schwab maintains cash or qualified securities in segregated reserve accounts for the exclusive benefit of clients. Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes &#160; include resale agreements, which are collateralized by U.S. Government and agency securities. Resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The Company obtains collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount 

- 64 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

loaned and accrued interest under resale agreements. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization. Cash and investments segregated also include certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities. Certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities are recorded at fair value. 

Receivables from brokerage clients 

Receivables from brokerage clients include margin loans to securities brokerage clients and other trading receivables from clients. Margin loans are collateralized by client securities and are carried at the amount receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company monitors margin levels and requires clients to deposit additional collateral, or reduce margin positions, to meet minimum collateral requirements if the fair value of the collateral changes. Receivables from brokerage clients that remain unsecured or partially secured for more than 30 days are fully reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts, except in the case of confirmed fraud, which is reserved immediately. The Company&#8217;s policy is to charge off any delinquent margin loans no later than at 90 days past due. Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab to pledge collateralized securities in accordance with federal regulations. The collateral is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for doubtful accounts for brokerage clients and related activity was immaterial for all periods presented. 

Other securities owned at fair value 

Other securities owned are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. Unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. 

Investment securities 

AFS securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in AOCI included in stockholders&#8217; equity. HTM securities are recorded at amortized cost based on the Company&#8217;s positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Realized gains and losses from sales of AFS securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in other revenue. 

Management evaluates whether investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value. 

A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover all of the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Where appropriate, models are utilized to estimate the credit loss on a discounted cash flow basis using the security&#8217;s effective interest rate. 

The evaluation of whether we expect to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation considers multiple factors including: the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss; the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; our internal credit ratings; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer&#8217;s industry; and whether all scheduled principal and interest payments have been received. 

Securities borrowed and securities loaned 

Securities borrowed transactions require Schwab to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for securities; the receivables from these transactions are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For securities loaned, Schwab receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned are monitored, with additional collateral obtained or refunded to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses 

Bank loans are recorded at their contractual principal amounts and include unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, loans are recorded net of an allowance for loan losses. The loan portfolio includes four loan types: First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses. 

Schwab records an allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings based on our estimate of probable incurred losses in the existing portfolio. We review the allowance for loan losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level. 

PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized dependent on the type of security pledged. Collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower&#8217;s committed line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. 

The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, LTV ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan types, including loan products within those types, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral. 

Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio (Estimated Current LTV) of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and LIBOR rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Loss severity estimates are based on our historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e., loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOC loans is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan type. 

Schwab considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). 

Nonaccrual, Nonperforming and Impaired loans 

First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of 

- 66 - 

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets. Nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned, and TDRs are considered impaired assets. 

Loan Charge-Offs 

The Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for loan losses and the loan balance. Our charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell. The Company&#8217;s policy for PALs is to charge off any delinquent loans no later than at 90 days past due. 

Equipment, office facilities, and property 

Equipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property include certain capitalized costs of acquired or internally developed software. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized when the costs relate to development of approved projects for our internal needs that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project and post-project activities are expensed as incurred. Equipment, office facilities, and property (other than land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows: 

##TABLE_START Equipment and office facilities 

3 to 10 years 

Buildings 

40 years 

Building and land improvements 

20 years 

Software 

3 to 10 years (1) 

Leasehold improvements 

Lesser of useful life or lease term 

##TABLE_END

(1) Amortized over contractual term if less than three years . 

Equipment, office facilities, and property are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the individually identified net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. Our annual impairment testing date is April 1 st . Schwab can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. A qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, and Company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities, and merger or acquisition activity. 

If the Company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill, or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, management estimates the fair values of each of the Company&#8217;s reporting units (defined as the Company&#8217;s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries, as well as a market capitalization analysis.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

Intangible assets 

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that best reflects their economic benefit. All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Intangible assets other than goodwill are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Investments 

We account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if the applicable requirements are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of taxes on income. The carrying value of LIHTC investments is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Unfunded commitments related to LIHTC investments are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Leases 

The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and server equipment and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease liability may include payments that depend on a rate or index (such as the Consumer Price Index), measured using the rate or index at the commencement date. Payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date are considered variable. These payments are not recognized as part of the lease liability and are expensed in the period incurred. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For the majority of our leases (real estate leases), the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We have not elected the practical expedient for equipment leases and account for lease and non-lease components separately for those classes of leases. 

As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include periods covered by options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. The lease terms may also include periods covered by options to terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will not exercise that option. 

Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Guarantees and indemnifications 

Schwab recognizes, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair values of obligations relating to guarantees are estimated based on transactions for similar guarantees or expected present value measures. 

Advertising and market development 

Advertising and market development activities include the cost to produce and distribute marketing campaigns as well as client incentives and discounts. Such costs are generally expensed when incurred. 

Income taxes 

Schwab provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or

realized. The effects of tax rate changes on future deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as other changes in income tax laws, are recorded in earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated to determine whether they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. When tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination the difference between positions taken on tax return filings and estimated potential tax settlement outcomes are recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. If a position is not more likely than not to be sustained, then none of the tax benefit is recognized in Schwab&#8217;s financial statements. Accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in taxes on income. Schwab records amounts within AOCI net of taxes. Income tax effects are released from AOCI using the specific-identification approach. 

Share-based compensation 

Share-based compensation includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock units. Schwab measures compensation expense for these share-based payment arrangements based on their estimated fair values as of the grant date. The fair value of the share-based award is recognized over the vesting period as share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense is based on options or units expected to vest and therefore is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Per the Company&#8217;s accounting policy election, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and reviewed annually based on the Company&#8217;s historical forfeiture experience. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures. The excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units are recorded in taxes on income. 

Earnings per common share 

EPS is computed using the two-class method. Preferred stock dividends and undistributed earnings and dividends allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income available to common stockholders. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares include, if dilutive, the effect of outstanding stock options and non-vested restricted stock units. 

Fair values of assets and liabilities 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the fair value hierarchy for disclosing assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the inputs used to value them. The fair value hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are based on market pricing data obtained from third-party sources independent of the Company. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is generally used to measure fair value whenever available. 

Unobservable inputs reflect management&#8217;s judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Where inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or liability are from different levels of the hierarchy, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment. The fair value hierarchy includes three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets as of the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, new issue data, and collateral performance. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

Schwab&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include: certain cash equivalents, certain investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, AFS securities, and certain other assets. The Company uses the market approach to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. 

Our primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar &#8220;to-be-issued&#8221; securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.

New Accounting Standards 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

##TABLE_START Standard 

Description 

Date of Adoption 

Effects on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842)&#8221; 

Amends the accounting for leases by lessees and lessors. The primary change from the new guidance is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Additional changes include accounting for lease origination and executory costs, required lessee reassessments during the lease term due to changes in circumstances, and expanded lease disclosures. Adoption provides for modified retrospective transition as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements in which the entity first applies the new standard or, optionally, through another transition method by which a cumulative-effect adjustment is recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Certain transition relief is permitted if elected by the entity. 

January 1, 2019 

The Company adopted the new lease accounting guidance as of January 1, 2019 under the optional transition method provided electing not to recast its comparative periods. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The adoption resulted in a gross up of the consolidated balance sheet due to recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities primarily related to the CS&#38;Co leases of office space and branches. The amounts were based on the present value of our remaining operating lease payments. The Company&#8217;s ROU assets and related lease liabilities upon adoption were $596 million and $662 million, respectively. Further details on the impact of adoption are included below in this Note as well as in Note 13. 

ASU 2017-08, &#8220;Receivables &#8211; Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities&#8221; 

Shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain callable debt securities to the earliest call date. The amendments are applicable to any purchased individual debt security with an explicit and noncontingent call feature with a fixed price on a preset date. ASU 2017-08 does not impact the accounting for callable debt securities held at a discount. Adoption requires modified retrospective transition as of the beginning of the period of adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. 

January 1, 2019 

The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Adoption resulted in an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. 

ASU 2017-12, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities&#8221; 

This ASU amends hedge accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with risk management activities, while reducing the complexity of applying and reporting on hedge accounting. In addition, for a closed pool of prepayable financial assets, entities will be able to hedge an amount that is not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other events under the &#8220;last-of-layer&#8221; method. The guidance also permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities eligible to be hedged under the &#8220;last-of-layer&#8221; method from HTM to AFS upon adoption. 

January 1, 2019 

The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2019. As part of its adoption, the Company made a one-time election to reclassify a portion of its HTM securities eligible to be hedged under the &#8220;last-of-layer&#8221; method to AFS. As of January 1, 2019, the securities reclassified had a fair value of $8.8 billion and resulted in a net of tax increase to AOCI of $19 million. The adoption of this standard had no other impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements.

Effects on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 

ASU 2016-13, &#8220;Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&#8221; 

Provides guidance for recognizing impairment of most debt instruments measured at amortized cost, including loans and HTM debt securities. Requires estimating current expected credit losses (CECL) over the remaining life of an instrument or a portfolio of instruments with similar risk characteristics based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts. The initial estimate of, and the subsequent changes in, CECL will be recognized as credit loss expense through current earnings and will be reflected as an allowance for credit losses offsetting the carrying value of the financial instrument(s) on the balance sheet. Amends the OTTI model for AFS debt securities by requiring the use of an allowance, rather than directly reducing the carrying value of the security, and eliminating consideration of the length of time such security has been in an unrealized loss position as a factor in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Adoption requires modified retrospective transition through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the entity applies the new guidance except that a prospective transition is required for AFS debt securities for which an OTTI has been recognized prior to the effective date. 

January 1, 2020 

The Company adopted CECL as of January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of CECL resulted in an immaterial increase in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses and an increase in the liability for expected credit losses on commitments to extend credit, both primarily related to First Mortgages and HELOCs. The adoption impact was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. 

The Company&#8217;s implementation work is now substantially complete. 

ASU 2018-15, &#8220;Intangibles&#8211;Goodwill and Other&#8211;Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)&#8221; 

Aligns the criteria for capitalizing implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements (CCA) that are service contracts with internal-use software that is developed or purchased and CCAs that include an internal-use software license. This guidance requires that the capitalized implementation costs be recognized over the period of the CCA service contract, subject to impairment evaluation on an ongoing basis. The guidance prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Adoption provides for retrospective or prospective application to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. 

January 1, 2020 

The Company adopted this guidance prospectively on January 1, 2020. As such, adoption had no impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Historically, Schwab has expensed implementation costs as they are incurred for CCAs that are service contracts. Therefore, adopting this guidance will change the Company&#8217;s accounting treatment for these types of implementation costs going forward. This guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on future financial statements, including EPS.

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 , substantially all rated securities in the investment portfolios were investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. 

Management evaluates whether investment securities are OTTI on a quarterly basis as described in Note 2 . No amounts were recognized as OTTI in earnings or other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018, and 2017. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Schwab did not hold any securities on which OTTI was previously recognized.

Credit Quality 

In addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Year of origination; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Borrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO); 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Estimated Current LTV ratios. 

##TABLE_END 

Borrowers&#8217; FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC&#8217;s origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 , First Mortgage loans of $ 10.5 billion had adjustable interest rates. Substantially all of these mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 26 % of the balance of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 68 % of the balance of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. Schwab&#8217;s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates.

The HELOC product has a 30 -year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20 -year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20 -year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. 

The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans:

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 , $ 905 million of the HELOC portfolio was secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans typically possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described previously, Schwab also monitors credit risk by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. At December 31, 2019 , the borrowers on approximately 52 % of HELOC loan balances outstanding only paid the minimum amount due.

Any cash dividends received from investments in FHLB stock are recognized as interest revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 

(2) Exclusive of indefinite-lived intangible assets of $ 77 million and $ 74 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, future amortization over the next five years and thereafter is expected to total $ 51 million . Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 27 million in 2019 , $ 29 million in 2018 , and $ 37 million in 2017 . 

Capitalized contract costs 

Capitalized contract costs relate to sales commissions paid to employees for obtaining contracts with clients and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over a period that is consistent with how the related revenue is recognized. Capitalized contract costs were $ 281 million and $ 250 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized contract costs was $ 55 million and $ 47 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which was recorded in compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.

Variable Interest Entities 

##TABLE_END 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , all of Schwab&#8217;s involvement with VIEs is through CSB&#8217;s CRA-related investments and most of those are related to LIHTC investments. As part of CSB&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives, CSB invests in funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties and receives tax credits and other tax benefits for these investments. During 2019 and 2018, CSB recorded amortization of $ 39 million and $ 32 million , respectively, and recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $ 47 million and $ 36 million , respectively, associated with these investments. The amortization, as well as the tax credits and other tax benefits, are included in taxes on income. 

Aggregate assets, liabilities and maximum exposure to loss 

The aggregate assets, liabilities, and maximum exposure to loss from those VIEs in which Schwab holds a variable interest, but is not the primary beneficiary, are summarized in the table below:

##TABLE_END

(1) Aggregate assets and aggregate liabilities are included in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

(2) Other CRA investments are recorded using either the adjusted cost method, equity method, or as HTM securities. Aggregate assets are included in HTM securities, bank loans &#8211; net, or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Schwab&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss would result from the loss of the investments, including any committed amounts. CSB&#8217;s funding of these remaining commitments is dependent upon the occurrence of certain conditions, and CSB expects to pay substantially all of these commitments between 2020 and 2023 . During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Schwab did not provide or intend to provide financial or other support to the VIEs that it was not contractually required to provide.

Short-term borrowings: Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the amount of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of their investment securities that are pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the collateral pledged provided a total borrowing capacity of $ 34.2 billion and $ 35.5 billion , respectively, of which no amounts were outstanding at the end of either period.

Loan Portfolio: CSB provides a co-branded loan origination program for CSB clients (the Program) with Quicken Loans, Inc. (Quicken Loans &#174; ). Pursuant to the Program, Quicken Loans originates and services First Mortgages and HELOCs for CSB clients. Under the Program, CSB purchases certain First Mortgages and HELOCs that are originated by Quicken Loans. CSB purchased First Mortgages of $ 4.4 billion and $ 2.1 billion during 2019 and 2018 , respectively. CSB purchased HELOCs with commitments of $ 242 million and $ 395 million during 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

Guarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation &#8211; a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2019 , the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $ 20 million . There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2019 . In connection with its securities lending activities,

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 

Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral. 

Schwab also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. Schwab&#8217;s liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. At December 31, 2019, amounts posted as collateral with such clearing houses and exchanges included $ 167 million of U.S. Treasury securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees. 

Acquisition of TD Ameritrade: On November 25, 2019, CSC announced a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade in an all-stock transaction. At the time of announcement, TD Ameritrade had approximately twelve million brokerage accounts and $ 1.3 trillion in total client assets. Under the agreement, TD Ameritrade stockholders will receive 1.0837 CSC shares for each TD Ameritrade share. Based on the closing price of CSC common stock on November 20, 2019, the merger consideration represented approximately $ 26 billion . The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. Under certain circumstances, CSC or TD Ameritrade could be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $ 950 million or reimburse the other party&#8217;s fees up to $ 50 million . 

Acquisition of USAA-IMCO: On July 25, 2019, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO, including over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $ 90 billion in client assets at the time of announcement, for $ 1.8 billion in cash. The companies have also agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement, effective at closing of the acquisition, that would make Schwab the exclusive wealth management and brokerage provider for USAA members. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the implementation of conversion plans. 

Legal contingencies: Schwab is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. 

Predicting the outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is inherently difficult, requiring significant judgment and evaluation of various factors, including the procedural status of the matter and any recent developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases; available defenses, including potential opportunities to dispose of a case on the merits or procedural grounds before trial (e.g., motions to dismiss or for summary judgment); the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts regarding potential damages; and potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions. It may not be reasonably possible to estimate a range of potential liability until the matter is closer to resolution &#8211; pending, for example, further proceedings, the outcome of key motions or appeals, or discussions among the parties. Numerous issues may have to be developed, such as discovery of important factual matters and determination of threshold legal issues, which may include novel or unsettled questions of law. Reserves are established or adjusted or further disclosure and estimates of potential loss are provided as the matter progresses and more information becomes available. 

Schwab believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is contesting liability and any damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation. Described below is a matter in which there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred or where the matter may otherwise be of significant interest to stockholders. Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of any potential liability given the stage of proceedings in the matter. With respect to all other pending matters, based on current information and consultation with counsel, it does not appear reasonably possible that the outcome of any such matter would be material to the financial condition, operating results, or cash flows of the Company. 

Crago Order Routing Litigation : On July 13, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a putative class of customers executing equity orders through CS&#38;Co. The lawsuit names CS&#38;Co and CSC as defendants and alleges that an agreement under which CS&#38;Co routed orders to UBS Securities LLC between July 13, 2011 and December 31, 2014 violated CS&#38;Co&#8217;s duty to seek best execution. Plaintiffs seek

unspecified damages, interest, injunctive and equitable relief, and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. After a first amended complaint was dismissed with leave to amend, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2017. Defendants again moved to dismiss, and in a decision issued December 5, 2017, the court denied the motion. Defendants have answered the complaint to deny all allegations, and are vigorously contesting the lawsuit. 

##TABLE_START 15. 

Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk 

##TABLE_END 

Resale agreements: Schwab enters into collateralized resale agreements principally with other broker-dealers, which could result in losses in the event the counterparty fails to purchase the securities held as collateral for the cash advanced and the fair value of the securities declines. To mitigate this risk, Schwab requires that the counterparty deliver securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a fair value at or in excess of the resale price. Schwab also sets standards for the credit quality of the counterparty, monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest, and requires additional collateral where deemed appropriate. The collateral provided under these resale agreements is utilized to meet obligations under broker-dealer client protection rules, which place limitations on our ability to access such segregated securities. For Schwab to repledge or sell this collateral, we would be required to deposit cash and/or securities of an equal amount into our segregated reserve bank accounts in order to meet our segregated cash and investment requirement. Schwab&#8217;s resale agreements are not subject to master netting arrangements. 

Securities lending: Schwab loans brokerage client securities temporarily to other brokers and clearing houses in connection with its securities lending activities and receives cash as collateral for the securities loaned. Increases in security prices may cause the fair value of the securities loaned to exceed the amount of cash received as collateral. In the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the loaned securities or provide additional cash collateral, we may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy our client obligations. Schwab mitigates this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, monitoring the fair value of securities loaned, and requiring additional cash as collateral when necessary. We also borrow securities from other broker-dealers to fulfill short sales by brokerage clients and deliver cash to the lender in exchange for the securities. The fair value of these borrowed securities was $ 719 million and $ 99 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Most of our securities lending transactions are through a program with a clearing organization, which guarantees the return of cash to us. Our securities lending transactions are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements with other broker-dealers; however, we do not net securities lending transactions. Therefore, the securities loaned and securities borrowed are presented gross in the consolidated balance sheets.

(2) Actual collateral was greater than or equal to 102 % of the related assets. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the fair value of collateral received in connection with resale agreements that are available to be repledged or sold was $ 9.2 billion and $ 7.4 billion , respectively. 

(3) Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 

(4) Included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The cash collateral received from counterparties under securities lending transactions was equal to or greater than the market value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

(5) Securities loaned are predominantly comprised of equity securities held in client brokerage accounts with overnight and continuous remaining contractual maturities. 

Client trade settlement: Schwab is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if our clients fail to meet their obligations to us. Clients are required to complete their transactions on settlement date, generally two business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, we may incur losses. We have established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades, and therefore the potential to make payments under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.

(2) Excludes income tax benefits from stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested of $ 23 million , $ 46 million , and $ 87 million in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. 

The Company issues shares for stock options and restricted stock units from treasury stock. At December 31, 2019 , the Company was authorized to grant up to 65 million common shares under its existing stock incentive plans. Additionally, at December 31, 2019 , the Company had 34 million shares reserved for future issuance under its employee stock purchase plan. 

As of December 31, 2019 , there was $ 290 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized through 2023 with a remaining weighted-average service period of 1.3 years for stock options, 2.5 years for restricted stock units, and 0.3 years for performance-based stock units. 

Stock Option Plan 

Options are granted for the purchase of shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options generally vest annually over a one - to four -year period from the date of grant.

##TABLE_END

We use an option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The model takes into account the contractual term of the stock option, expected volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of publicly-traded options on CSC&#8217;s stock. Dividend yield is based on the average historical CSC dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term similar to the contractual term of the option. We use historical option exercise data, which includes employee termination data, to estimate the probability of future option exercises. The assumptions used to value the options granted during the years presented and their expected lives were as follows:

Restricted Stock Units 

Restricted stock units are awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of CSC&#8217;s common stock following a vesting period. Restricted stock units are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a one - to four -year period, while performance-based restricted stock units also require the Company achieve certain financial or other measures prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of the restricted stock units that vested during each of the years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $ 123 million , $ 166 million , and $ 127 million , respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans 

Schwab&#8217;s deferred compensation plan for officers permits participants to defer the receipt of certain cash compensation. The deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors permits participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their director fees and to receive either a grant of stock options, or upon ceasing service as a director, the number of shares of CSC&#8217;s common stock that would have resulted from investing the deferred fee amount into CSC&#8217;s common stock. The deferred compensation liability was $ 164 million and $ 144 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

FC Career Achievement Plan 

&#160; 

The FC career achievement plan is a noncontributory, unfunded, nonqualified plan for eligible FCs. An FC is eligible for earned cash payments after retirement contingent upon meeting certain performance levels, tenure, age, and client transitioning requirements. Allocations to the plan are calculated annually based on performance levels achieved and eligible compensation and are subject to general creditors of the Company. Full vesting occurs when an FC reaches 60 years of age and has at least ten years of service with the Company.

Taxes on Income 

##TABLE_END 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. Schwab&#8217;s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was 23.6 % , 23.1 % , and 35.5 % , respectively. 

Also as a result of the Tax Act, Schwab recognized a $ 46 million one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the Tax Act. During 2018, we concluded our analysis and accounting for all remaining impacts of the Tax Act, including the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences, resulting in no additional material impacts. 

&#160; 

As of January 1, 2018, Schwab adopted ASU 2018-02, which resulted in a decrease to AOCI and an increase to retained earnings by $ 33 million for the reclassification of certain impacts of the Tax Act. Schwab also adopted ASU 2014-09, &#8220; Revenue &#8211; Revenue from Contracts with Customers &#8221; as of January 1, 2018, which resulted in recording an initial asset for capitalized contract costs of $ 219 million and a related deferred tax liability of $ 52 million . As of December 31, 2019 , the deferred tax liability related to the capitalized contract costs was $ 68 million .

Interest and penalties were accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had accrued approximately $ 11 million and $ 9 million , respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to routine examinations by the respective federal, state and applicable local jurisdictions&#8217; taxing authorities. Federal returns for 2011 through 2014 and 2016 through 2018 remain subject to examination. The years open to examination by state and local governments vary by jurisdiction. 

21. &#160; Regulatory Requirements 

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and CSB, CSC&#8217;s primary depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank. CSC is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. CSB is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the OCC, as its primary regulator, the FDIC as its deposit insurer, and the CFPB. CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for CSB. 

CSB is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital requirements and requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit to, or asset purchases from CSC or its other subsidiaries by CSB. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, CSB could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories. CSC and CSB are required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on CSC and CSB. At December 31, 2019 , both CSC and CSB met all of their respective capital requirements.

##TABLE_END

(1) Beginning in 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital and report our supplementary leverage ratio, which is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including unused commitments. Prior to 2019, CSC and CSB elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2018 are presented on this basis. In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. 

(2) Under the Basel III capital rule, CSC and CSB are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer and, beginning in 2019, a countercyclical capital buffer above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer became 2.5% on January 1, 2019 (1.875% at December 31, 2018). At December 31, 2019, the countercyclical capital buffer was zero. If either buffer falls below the minimum requirement, the Company would be subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2019 , the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively. 

N/A Not applicable. 

Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2019 , CSB is considered well capitalized (the highest category) under its respective regulatory capital rules. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2019 that management believes have changed CSB&#8217;s capital category. 

The Federal Reserve requires CSB to maintain reserve balances at the Federal Reserve based on its deposits that are considered to be transaction accounts. CSB&#8217;s average reserve requirement was $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.6 billion in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In late 2017, Schwab acquired a federal savings bank charter which is now called Charles Schwab Premier Bank (CSPB). In 2018, the Company established Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank) as a Nevada state-chartered savings bank to provide certain trust and custody services. At December 31, 2019, the balance sheets of CSPB and Trust Bank consisted primarily of investment securities, and the entities held total assets of $ 14.3 billion and $ 6.1 billion , respectively. Based on their regulatory capital ratios, at December 31, 2019, CSPB and Trust Bank are considered well capitalized under their respective regulatory capital rules.

CS&#38;Co, a securities broker-dealer, is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. CS&#38;Co computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted by the Uniform Net Capital Rule. This method requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement of $250,000 , which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. Under the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not repay subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends, or make any unsecured advances or loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement. 

Net capital and net capital requirements for CS&#38;Co are as follows:

Pursuant to the SEC&#8217;s Customer Protection Rule and other applicable regulations, Schwab had cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients at December 31, 2019. Amounts included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes represent actual balances on deposit, whereas cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2019 for CS&#38;Co totaled $ 23.0 billion . As of January 3, 2020, CS&#38;Co had deposited $ 3.1 billion of cash and qualified securities into its segregated reserve accounts. Cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2018 for CS&#38;Co totaled $ 16.7 billion . As of January 3, 2019, CS&#38;Co had deposited $ 3.7 billion of cash and qualified securities into its segregated reserve accounts. Cash and cash equivalents included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes are presented as part of Schwab&#8217;s cash balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Segment Information 

##TABLE_END 

Schwab&#8217;s two reportable segments are Investor Services and Advisor Services. Schwab structures the operating segments according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. 

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2 . For the computation of its segment information, Schwab utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues. 

Management evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. There are no revenues from transactions between the segments.

25. &#160; Subsequent Events 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final enhanced prudential standards rule, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, and the FDIC jointly issued a final regulatory capital and liquidity rule. With total consolidated assets of $ 294.0 billion at December 31, 2019, CSC is designated as a Category III firm pursuant to the framework established by the final rules. Accordingly, the Company opted to exclude AOCI from its regulatory capital as permitted by the regulatory capital and liquidity rule beginning January 1, 2020. In accordance with ASC 320 and as of January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as HTM to the AFS category without tainting our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. At the date of transfer, these securities had a total amortized cost of $ 134.7 billion and a total net unrealized gain of $ 1.4 billion .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Charles Schwab Corporation: 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders ' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Asset Management and Administration Fees and Trading Revenue &#8211; Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

Revenues from asset management and administrative fees (AMAF) are generated through proprietary, third-party mutual fund and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Trading revenue is generated through commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs. Both AMAF and trading revenue is made up of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, and uses automated systems to process and record revenue from these transactions based on underlying information sourced from multiple systems. The processing and recording of revenue is highly automated and is based on contractual terms with individual investors, mutual funds and investment advisors. As of December 31, 2019, total net revenue was $10.7 billion, of which $3.8 billion is AMAF and trading revenue. 

Given that the Company&#8217;s process to record revenue is highly automated and involves multiple systems, auditing these revenue streams was complex and challenging due to the extent of audit effort required and involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (IT) which was necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company&#8217;s systems. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the Company&#8217;s systems to process the AMAF and trading revenue transactions included the following, among others: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:

Identified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and, using a risk-based approach, tested the relevant general IT controls over each of these systems. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Performed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls (including batch processing) within the relevant revenue streams, as well as the controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenue. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company&#8217;s general ledger. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We performed testing of controls addressing the accuracy and completeness of reports used in the performance of controls. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

With the assistance of our data specialists, we created data visualizations to evaluate recorded revenue and evaluate trends in the revenue data. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

For a sample of transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue and agreeing inputs to the calculation to contractual agreements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested the amount of client assets by obtaining quoted market prices and reconciling total positions to third-party statements.
