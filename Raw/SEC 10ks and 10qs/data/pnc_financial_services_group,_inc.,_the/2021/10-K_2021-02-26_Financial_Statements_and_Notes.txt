Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the allowance for credit losses in 2020. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses &#8211; Commercial Loans 

As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loans and lease losses was approximately $5,361 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $3,337 million relates to commercial loans. For commercial loans, the determination of the allowance is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts and other relevant factors. As disclosed by management, the Company has established a framework for developing the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, which includes the use of four economic forecast scenarios and associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. To generate the four economic forecast scenarios, the Company uses a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes. The economic forecast scenarios which are inputs into the credit loss models, include a number of economic variables with the most significant drivers being GDP and unemployment rate measures. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company&#8217;s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. For example, qualitative factors that the Company considers include industry concentration and conditions, changes in market conditions, recent credit quality trends, model imprecision, the impacts of COVID-19 on highly impacted segments, and other factors. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing economic forecast scenarios, determining weighting of each scenario, and estimating qualitative reserves related to the impacts of COVID-19 on certain highly impacted segments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, including controls over the development and approval of economic forecast scenarios, related weightings, and qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness and methodology of certain loss forecasting models (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain borrower risk characteristics, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain forecasted economic variables such as GDP and unemployment measures, (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s weighting of economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (v) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (vi) evaluating certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating certain models, model inputs, economic forecasts, and qualitative reserves in the commercial allowance estimate.

B USINESS 

PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the U.S. and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located primarily in markets across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. 

N OTE 1 A CCOUNTING P OLICIES 

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests and variable interest entities. 

We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

We prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements and the ACL. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Discontinued Operations 

A disposal of an asset or business that meets the criteria for held for sale classification is reported as discontinued operations when the disposal represents a strategic shift that has had, or will have a major effect on our operating results. We report an asset as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the asset and is committed to a formal plan, the asset is available for immediate sale, the asset is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the ensuing year and certain other specified criteria are met. An asset classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is written down to its fair value upon the held for sale designation. Our BlackRock held for sale asset is recorded at its carrying amount as we accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting and the fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying value at each balance sheet date. 

When presenting discontinued operations, assets classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet commencing in the period in which the asset meets all of the held for sale criteria described above and prior periods are recast. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the asset or business is either disposed of or is classified as held for sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the sale or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.

Various improvements related to Credit Losses (Topics 1, 2 and 5) 

Issued April 2019 

Targeted Transition 

Relief - Credit Losses - ASU 2019-05 

Issued May 2019 

Codification Improvements - ASU 2019-11 

Issued November 2019 

&#8226; Commonly referred to as the CECL standard. 

&#8226; Replaces measurement, recognition and disclosure guidance for credit related reserves ( i.e ., ALLL and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and OTTI for debt securities. 

&#8226; Requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, current expected credit losses for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized starting from the time of origination or acquisition. 

&#8226; Methodology applies to loans, net investment in leases, debt securities and certain financial assets not accounted for at fair value through net income. It also applies to unfunded lending related commitments except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. 

&#8226; In-scope assets are presented at the net amount expected to be collected after the deduction or addition of the ACL from the amortized cost basis of the assets. 

&#8226; Requires inclusion of expected recoveries of previously charged-off amounts for in-scope assets. 

&#8226; Requires enhanced credit quality disclosures including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage. 

&#8226; Requires a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at adoption. 

&#8226; Adopted January 1, 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaled $671 million at adoption. 

&#8226; Amended presentation and disclosures are required prospectively. Refer to the disclosures in this Note 1, Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information. 

&#8226; With the adoption of CECL, we discontinued the accounting for purchased impaired loans and elected the one-time fair value option election for some of these loans and certain residential real estate collateral dependent loans. Loans that were previously accounted for as purchased impaired where the fair value option election was not made are now accounted for as PCD loans. 

&#8226; There was no impact to the recorded investment of our investment securities or loans, except for our PCD loan portfolio. Accounting for these loans as PCD required an adjustment to the remaining accretable discount and recorded investment in addition to the impact on ACL due to the adoption of CECL methodology. 

&#8226; Refer to Table 38 for a summary of the impact of the CECL standard adoption.

Codification Improvements - ASU 2019-04 

Topic 3: Codification Improvements to ASU 2017-12 and Other Hedging Items 

Issued April 2019 

&#8226; Targeted improvements related to: 

&#160;- Partial-term fair value hedges of interest rate risk 

&#160;- Amortization of fair value hedge basis adjustments 

&#160;- Disclosure of fair value hedge basis adjustments 

&#160;- Consideration of the hedged contractually specified interest rate under the hypothetical derivative method 

&#160;- Application of a first-payments-received cash flow hedging technique to overall cash flows on a group of variable interest payments 

&#160;- Update to transition guidance for ASU 2017-12 

&#8226; This ASU permits a one-time transfer out of held to maturity securities to provide entities the opportunity to hedge fixed rate, prepayable securities under a last of layer hedging strategy (although an entity is not required to hedge such securities subsequent to transfer). 

&#8226; Adopted January 1, 2020. 

&#8226; As permitted by the eligibility requirements in this guidance, at adoption we elected to transfer debt securities with an amortized cost of $16.2 billion (fair value of $16.5 billion) from held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. The transfer resulted in a pretax increase to AOCI of $306 million. There were no other impacts to PNC&#8217;s consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this guidance.

Goodwill - ASU 2017-04 

Issued January 2017 

&#8226; Eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill under which a loss was recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. 

&#8226; Requires impairment to be recognized if the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value exceeds the fair value. 

&#8226; Adopted January 1, 2020. 

&#8226; The adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.

Reference Rate Reform - ASU 2020-04 

Issued March 2020 

Reference Rate Reform Scope - ASU 2021-01 

Issued January 2021 

&#8226; Provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform (codified in ASC 848). 

&#8226; Includes optional expedients related to contract modifications that allow an entity to account for modifications (if certain criteria are met) as if the modifications were only minor (assets within the scope of ASC 310, Receivables), were not substantial (assets within the scope of ASC 470, Debt) and/or did not result in remeasurements or reclassifications (assets within the scope of ASC 842, Leases, and other Topics) of the existing contract. 

&#160;&#8226; Includes optional expedients related to hedging relationships within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives &#38; Hedging, whereby changes to the critical terms of a hedging relationship do not require dedesignation if certain criteria are met. In addition, potential sources of ineffectiveness as a result of reference rate reform may be disregarded when performing some effectiveness assessments. 

&#8226; Includes optional expedients and exceptions for contract modifications and hedge accounting that apply to derivative instruments impacted by the market-wide discounting transition. 

&#8226; Allows for a one-time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that are classified as held to maturity before January 1, 2020. 

&#8226; Guidance in these ASUs are effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; Adopted March 12, 2020. ASU 2021-01 was retrospectively adopted October 1, 2020. 

&#8226; During the second quarter of 2020, we elected to transfer all debt securities classified as held to maturity that are indexed to LIBOR to the available for sale portfolio. All securities were classified as held to maturity prior to January 1, 2020. These securities had an amortized cost and fair value of $49 million and $48 million, respectively, as of the transfer date. See Note 3 Investment Securities for more information. 

&#8226; During the fourth quarter of 2020, we elected to apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships to derivative instruments impacted by the market-wide discounting transition. These optional expedients remove the requirement to remeasure contract modifications or dedesignate hedging relationships due to reference rate reform. The elections made in the fourth quarter of 2020 apply only to derivative instruments impacted by the market-wide discounting transition, not all derivative instruments. 

&#8226; As of December 31, 2020, we have not yet elected to apply any optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships to any other financial instruments. However, we plan to elect these optional expedients in the future.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 

Cash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes because they represent a primary source of liquidity. Certain cash balances within Cash and due from banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements. 

Investments 

We hold interests in various types of investments. The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as: 

&#8226; Ownership interest, 

&#8226; Our plans for the investment, and 

&#8226; The nature of the investment. 

Debt Securities 

Debt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. We classify debt securities as either trading, held to maturity, or available for sale. Debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customer-related trading activities are classified as trading securities, are reported in the Other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other noninterest income. We classify debt securities as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity, and carry them at amortized cost, less any allowance. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as securities available for sale, and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in AOCI net of income taxes. 

&#160; 

We include all interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities, in net interest income using the constant effective yield method generally calculated over the contractual lives of the securities. Effective yields reflect either the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition or, for debt securities where an OTTI was recorded, the effective interest rate determined based on improved cash flows subsequent to an impairment. We compute gains and losses realized on the sale of available for sale debt securities on a specific security basis. These securities gains/(losses) are included in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

As discussed in the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards section of this Note 1, we adopted the CECL standard as of January 1, 

2020, which requires expected credit losses on both held to maturity and available for sale securities to be recognized through a 

valuation allowance, ACL, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. An available for sale security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. If we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell an impaired available for sale security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. Credit losses on investment securities are recognized through the Provision for credit losses on our Consolidated Income Statement. Declines in the fair value of available for sale securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The CECL standard is applied prospectively to debt securities and, as a result, the amortized cost basis of investment securities for which OTTI had previously been recorded did not change upon adoption. 

Prior to the adoption of CECL, we reviewed all debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position for OTTI. An investment security was deemed impaired if the fair value of the investment was less than its amortized cost. After an investment security was determined to be impaired, we evaluated whether the decline in value was other-than-temporary. Declines in the fair value of debt securities that were deemed other-than-temporary and were attributable to credit deterioration were recognized in Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the determination was made. Declines in fair value which were deemed other-than-temporary and attributable to factors other than credit deterioration were recognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

We consider a security to be past due in terms of payment based on its contractual terms. A security may be placed on nonaccrual, with interest no longer recognized until received, when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful. As of December 31, 2020, nonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity securities were immaterial. 

A security may be partially or fully charged off against the allowance if it is determined to be uncollectible, including, for an available for sale security, if we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Recoveries of previously charged-off available for sale securities are recognized when received, while recoveries on held to maturity securities are recognized when expected. 

See the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Note 1 for further discussion regarding the methodologies used to determine the 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 103 

allowance for investment securities. See Note 3 Investment Securities for additional information about the investment securities portfolio and the related ACL. 

Equity Securities and Partnership Interests 

We account for equity securities, equity investments, private equity investments, and investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated under one of the following methods: 

&#8226; We use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income and any dividends received on equity method investments are recorded as a reduction to the investment balance. When an equity investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value, we may be required to record a loss on the investment. 

&#8226; We measure equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value at fair value through Net income. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Noninterest income. Dividend income on these equity securities is included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement. 

&#8226; We generally use the practicability exception to fair value measurement for all other investments without a readily determinable fair value. When we elect this alternative measurement method, the investment is recorded at cost and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same issuer. These investments are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates impairment and the fair value is less than the carrying value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in Noninterest income. Distributions received on these investments are included in Noninterest income. 

Investments described above are included in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Private Equity Investments 

We report private equity investments, which include direct investments in companies, affiliated partnership interests and indirect investments in private equity funds, at estimated fair value. These estimates are based on available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. Fair values of publicly-traded direct investments are determined using quoted market prices and are subject to various discount factors arising from security level restrictions, when appropriate. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments and indirect investments are detailed in Note 15 Fair Value. We include all private equity investments within Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of private equity investments are recognized in Other noninterest income. 

We consolidate affiliated partnerships when we have determined that we have control of the partnership or are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own is reflected in Noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Loans 

Loans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Management&#8217;s intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies, the economic environment, market conditions and the availability of government programs. 

Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on how COVID-19 hardship related loan modifications are reported from a delinquency perspective as of December 31, 2020. 

Loans held for investment, excluding PCD loans, are recorded at amortized cost basis unless we elect to measure these under the fair value option. Amortized cost basis represents principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, premiums or discounts on purchased loans and charge-offs. Amortized cost basis does not include accrued interest, as we include accrued interest in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and recorded in Interest income as earned using the constant effective yield method. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or amortized into Net interest income using the constant effective yield method, over the contractual life of the loan. The processing fee received for loans originated through PPP lending under the CARES Act is deferred and accreted into Net interest income using the effective yield method, over the contractual life of the loan. Loans under the fair value option are reported at their fair value, with any changes to fair value reported as Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement, and are excluded from measurement of ALLL. 

In addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through the secondary loan market, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies. Certain acquired loans that have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination (i.e., PCD) are recognized at an amortized cost basis equal to their purchase price plus an ALLL measured at the 

104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

acquisition date. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality are recognized through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded ALLL . 

We consider a loan to be collateral dependent when we determine that substantially all of the expected cash flows will be generated 

from the operation or sale of the collateral underlying the loan, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we have elected to 

measure the loan at the estimated fair value of collateral (less costs to sell if sale or foreclosure of the property is expected). 

Additionally, we consider a loan to be collateral dependent when foreclosure or liquidation of the underlying collateral is probable. 

A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. A concession has been granted when we do not expect to collect all amounts due, including original interest accrued at the original contract rate, as a result of the restructuring, or there is a delay in payment that is more than insignificant. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities, and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us. In those situations where principal is forgiven, the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. 

Potential incremental losses or recoveries on TDRs have been factored into the ALLL estimates for each loan class under the methodologies described in this Note. Once a loan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be reported as a TDR until it is ultimately repaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed upon or it is fully charged off. 

PNC excludes consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and certain government insured or guaranteed loans from our TDR population. PCD loans do not require additional considerations and thus are evaluated for inclusion in our TDR population. In addition, PNC has elected not to apply a TDR designation to loans that have been restructured due to a COVID-19 hardship pursuant to specific criteria under the CARES Act. Since loans restructured due to a COVID-19 related hardship were not identified as TDRs, they are not placed on nonaccrual at the time of modification unless payment in full of principal or interest is not expected. These loans continue to be subject to our existing nonaccrual policy.

regulatory guidance. 

##TABLE_END

Commercial 

We generally charge-off commercial (commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing) nonperforming loans when we determine that a specific loan, or portion thereof, is uncollectible. This determination is based on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual loans. In making this determination, we consider the viability of the business or project as a going concern, the past due status when the asset is not well-secured, the expected cash flows to repay the loan, the value of the collateral and the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform. 

Additionally, in general, for smaller commercial loans of $100,000 or less, a full charge-off occurs at 180 days past due for term loans and revolvers. For smaller commercial leases of $1 million or less, a full charge-off occurs at 120 days past due. Small business credit card balances are charged-off at 180 days past due. 

Consumer 

We generally charge-off secured consumer (home equity, residential real estate and automobile) nonperforming loans to the fair 

value of collateral less costs to sell, if lower than the amortized cost basis of the loan outstanding, when delinquency of the loan, combined with other risk factors (e.g., bankruptcy, lien position or troubled debt restructuring), indicates that the loan, or some portion thereof, is uncollectible as per our historical experience, or the collateral has been repossessed. We charge-off secured consumer loans no later than 180 days past due. Most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by automobiles or residential real estate, are charged-off once they have reached 120 - 180 days past due. 

106 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

For secured collateral dependent loans, collateral values are updated at least annually and subsequent declines in collateral values are charged-off resulting in incremental provision for credit loss. Subsequent increases in collateral values may be reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to reflect the expectation of recoveries in an amount greater than previously expected, limited to amounts previously charged-off. 

Accounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases and Other Nonaccrual Loans 

For nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual and deferred fee/cost recognition is discontinued. Additionally, the current year accrued and uncollected interest is reversed through Net interest income and prior year accrued and uncollected interest is charged-off, except for credit cards, where we reverse any accrued interest through Net interest income at the time of charge-off, as per industry standard practice. Nonaccrual loans that are also collateral dependent may be charged-off to reduce the basis to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. 

If payment is received on a nonaccrual loan, generally the payment is first applied to the remaining principal balance; payments are then applied to recover any charged-off amounts related to the loan. Finally, if both principal balance and any charge-offs have been recovered, then the payment will be recorded as fee and interest income. For certain consumer loans, the receipt of interest payments is recognized as interest income on a cash basis. Cash basis income recognition is applied if a loan&#8217;s amortized cost basis is deemed fully collectible and the loan has performed for at least six months. 

For TDRs, payments are applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan is deemed non-performing. TDRs are generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable period of time, generally six months, in which the loan performs under restructured terms and meets other performance indicators, it is returned to performing/accruing status. This return to performing/accruing status demonstrates that the bank expects to collect all of the loan&#8217;s remaining contractual principal and interest. TDRs resulting from (i) borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, and (ii) borrowers that are not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. 

Other nonaccrual loans are generally not returned to accrual status until the borrower has performed in accordance with the contractual terms and other performance indicators for at least six months, the period of time which was determined to demonstrate the expected collection of the loan&#8217;s remaining contractual principal and interest. Nonaccrual loans with partially charged-off principal are not returned to accrual. When a nonperforming loan is returned to accrual status, it is then considered a performing loan. 

Foreclosed assets consist of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. OREO comprises principally commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. After obtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of sale in the loan instruments, the property will be sold. When we are awarded title or completion of deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is initially recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell. Based upon the estimated fair value less cost to sell, the amortized cost basis of the loan is adjusted and a charge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL. We estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals, or sales agreements with third parties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or estimated fair value less cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in Other noninterest expense. 

For certain mortgage loans that have a government guarantee, we establish a separate other receivable upon foreclosure. The receivable is measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor. 

See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in this Report for additional information on nonperforming assets, TDRs and credit quality indicators related to our loan portfolio. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL, in accordance with the CECL standard, is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an 

appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases (including residual values), other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date. The remaining contractual term of assets in scope of CECL is estimated considering contractual maturity dates, prepayment expectations, utilization or draw expectations and any embedded extension options that do not allow us to unilaterally cancel the extension options. For products without a fixed contractual maturity date ( e.g ., credit cards), we rely on historical payment behavior to determine the length of the paydown or default time period. 

We estimate expected losses on a pooled basis using a combination of (i) the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) a period of reversion to long run average expected losses where applicable and (iii) the long run average expected 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 107 

losses for the remaining estimated contractual term. For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also includes individually assessed reserves and qualitative reserves, as applicable. 

We use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period. For this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios produced by PNC&#8217;s Economics Team, which are designed to reflect business cycles and their related estimated probabilities. The forecast length that we have determined to be reasonable and supportable is three years. As noted in the methodology discussions that follow, forward-looking information is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates. Such forward looking information includes forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, which are estimated using quantitative techniques, analysis from PNC economists and management judgment. 

The reversion period is used to bridge our three year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long run average expected credit losses. We may consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the long run average period. The reversion period is typically 1-3 years, if not immediate. 

The long run average expected credit losses are derived from long run historical credit loss information adjusted for the credit quality of the current portfolio, and therefore do not consider current and forecasted economic conditions. 

See the following sections related to investment securities, loans, trade receivables, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments for details about specific methodologies. 

Allowance for Investment Securities 

A significant portion of our investment securities are issued or guaranteed by either the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or GNMA) or a government-sponsored agency (FNMA or FHLMC). Taking into consideration historical information and current and forecasted conditions, we do not expect to incur any credit losses on these securities. 

Investment securities that are not issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or a government-sponsored agency consist of both securitized products, such as non-agency mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as non-securitized products, such as corporate and municipal debt securities. A discounted cash flow approach is primarily used to determine the amount of the allowance required. The estimates of expected cash flows are determined using macroeconomic sensitive models taking into consideration the reasonable and supportable forecast period and scenarios discussed above. Additional factors unique to a specific security may also be taken into consideration when estimating expected cash flows. The cash flows expected to be collected, after considering expected prepayments, are discounted at the effective interest rate. For an available-for-sale security, the amount of the allowance is limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its estimated fair value. 

See Note 3 Investment Securities in this Report for additional information about the investment securities portfolio. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

Our pooled expected loss methodology is based upon the quantification of risk parameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan or loan segment. We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on contractual maturity in our expected loss estimates. We use historical credit loss information, current borrower risk characteristics and forecasted economic variables for the reasonable and supportable forecast period, coupled with analytical methods, to estimate these risk parameters by loan or loan segments. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the long run average period, and combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario. The following matrix provides key credit risk characteristics that we use to estimate these risk parameters.

##TABLE_END

After the forecast period, we revert to the long run average over the reversion period noted above, which is the period between the end of the forecast period and when losses are estimated to have completely reverted to the long run average. 

Once we have developed a combined estimate of credit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast period, reversion period and long run average) under each of the forecasted scenarios, we produce a probability-weighted credit loss estimate by loan class. We then add or deduct any qualitative components and other adjustments, such as individually assessed loans, to produce the ALLL. See the Individually Assessed Component and Qualitative Component discussions that follow in this Note 1 for additional information about those adjustments. 

Discounted Cash Flow 

In addition to TDRs, we also use a discounted cash flow methodology for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes. We determine effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for estimated prepayments. Changes in the ALLL due to the impact of the passage of time under the discounted cash flow estimate are recognized through the provision for credit losses. 

Individually Assessed Component 

Loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans are individually assessed as follows: 

&#8226; For commercial nonperforming loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, reserves are based on an analysis of the present value of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming commercial loans below the defined threshold, and accruing TDRs are reserved for under a pooled basis. 

&#8226; For consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

Qualitative Component 

While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant credit risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between expected and actual outcomes. We may hold additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. The ACL also takes into account factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individually assessed or pooled reserves. Such qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to: 

110 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

&#8226; Industry concentrations and conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 on highly impacted segments, 

&#8226; Changes in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements, 

&#8226; Changes in the nature and volume of our portfolio, 

&#8226; Recent credit quality trends, including the impact of COVID-19 hardship related loan modifications, 

&#8226; Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique events, 

&#8226; Recent macro-economic factors that may not be reflected in the forecast information, 

&#8226; Limitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral values, 

&#8226; Model imprecision and limitations, 

&#8226; Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and procedures, 

&#8226; Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions. 

See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information about our loan portfolio and the related allowance. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (Incurred Loss Methodology) 

Prior to the adoption of CECL, we maintained the ALLL at a level that we believed to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet date. These evaluations were inherently subjective, as they required material estimates, and included, among others: PD, LGD, EAD, movement through delinquency stages, amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, value of collateral and qualitative factors. 

For all loans and leases, except purchased impaired loans, the ALLL was the sum of three components: 

&#8226; Asset specific/individual impaired reserves: Nonperforming loans that were considered impaired under ASC 310 &#8211; Receivables , which included all commercial and consumer TDRs, were evaluated for specific reserves. 

&#8226; Quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves: Quantitative reserves in the commercial portfolio were determined through quantitative loss modeling utilizing PD, LGD, and the outstanding balance of the loan, while quantitative reserves in the consumer portfolio were determined primarily using transition matrices, including a roll-rate model. 

&#8226; Qualitative (judgmental) reserves. 

The reserve calculation and determination process was dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes reacted to and were influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrowers and economic conditions. 

Accrued Interest 

When accrued interest is reversed or charged-off in a timely manner, the CECL standard provides a practical expedient to exclude 

accrued interest from ACL measurement. We consider our nonaccrual and charge-off policies to be timely for all of our investment 

securities, loans and leases, with the exception of consumer credit cards, education loans and certain unsecured consumer lines of credit. We consider the length of time before nonaccrual/charge-off and the use of appropriate other triggering events for nonaccrual and charge-offs in making this determination. Pursuant to these policy elections, we calculate reserves for accrued interest on credit cards, education loans and certain unsecured consumer lines of credit, which are then included within the ALLL. See the Debt Securities and Nonperforming Loans and Leases sections of this Note 1 for additional information on our nonaccrual and charge-off policies. 

Additionally, pursuant to our use of a discounted cash flow methodology in estimating credit losses for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes, applicable reserves for accrued interest are also included within the ALLL for these loan classes . 

Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or Securities 

The allowance for PCD loans or securities is determined at the time of acquisition (including January 1, 2020 when certain purchased impaired loans were grandfathered and transitioned to PCD upon adoption of CECL), as the estimated expected credit loss of the outstanding balance or par value, based on the methodologies described previously for loans and securities. In accordance with CECL, the allowance recognized at acquisition is added to the acquisition date purchase price to determine the asset&#8217;s amortized cost basis. 

Prior to the adoption of CECL, acquired purchased impaired loans were recorded at fair value. When evidence of credit quality deterioration and evidence that it was probable that we would be unable to collect all contractual amounts due existed, we considered the loans to be purchased credit impaired and we estimated the amount and timing of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition for each loan either individually or on a pool basis. The excess of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over its carrying value represented the accretable yield which was recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (or pool of loans) using the constant effective yield method. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that were attributable to credit quality were recognized as impairments resulting in an increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows were recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded ALLL or prospectively through an adjustment of the loan&#8217;s or pool&#8217;s yield over its remaining life. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 111 

Allowance for Unfunded Lending Related Commitments 

We maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable (e.g., unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees), at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for loans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for the key credit risk characteristics for unfunded lending related commitments. The allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve are included in the provision for credit losses. 

See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information about this allowance. 

Prior to the adoption of CECL, we maintained the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believed was appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date. We determined the allowance based on periodic evaluations of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of the probability of commitment usage, credit risk factors, and, solely for commercial lending, the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for funded exposures. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit were included in the provision for credit losses. 

Allowance for Other Financial Assets 

We determine the allowance for other financial assets (e.g., trade receivables, servicing advances on PNC-owned loans, balances with banks) considering historical loss information and other available indicators. In certain cases where there are no historical, current or forecast indicators of an expected credit loss, we may estimate the reserve to be close to zero. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for other financial assets was immaterial. 

Loans Held for Sale 

We designate loans as held for sale when we have the intent and ability to sell them. At the time of designation to held for sale, any allowance is reversed, and a valuation allowance for the shortfall between the amortized cost basis and the net realizable value is recognized, excluding the amounts already charged off. Similarly, when loans are no longer considered held for sale, the valuation allowance (net of writedowns) is reversed, and an allowance for credit losses is established, excluding the amounts already charged-off. Write-downs on these loans (if required) are recorded as charge-offs through the valuation allowance. Adjustments to the valuation allowance on held for sale loans are recognized in Other noninterest income. 

We have elected to account for certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The changes in the fair value of the commercial mortgage loans are measured and recorded in Other noninterest income while such changes for the residential mortgage loans are measured and recorded in Residential mortgage noninterest income each period. See Note 15 Fair Value for additional information. 

Interest income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and the loan&#8217;s contractual interest rate. 

In certain circumstances, loans designated as held for sale may be transferred to held for investment based on a change in strategy. We transfer these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value; however, any loans originated or purchased for the held for sale portfolio and for which the fair value option has been elected remain at fair value for the life of the loan. 

Loan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained Interests 

We recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We have sold mortgage and other loans through securitization transactions. In a securitization, financial assets are transferred into trusts or to SPEs in transactions to effectively legally isolate the assets from us. 

In a securitization, the trust or SPE issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the trust. The senior classes of the asset-backed securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings at the time of issuance. These ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower-rated subordinated classes of asset-backed securities, as well as subordinated or residual interests. In certain cases, we may retain a portion or all of the securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts. Securitized loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in Noninterest income at the time of initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. We generally estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future expected cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable. 

112 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

With the exception of loan sales to certain U.S. government-chartered entities, our loan sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us except for representations and warranties and with no restrictions on the retained interests. We originate, sell and service commercial mortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program. Under the provisions of the DUS program, we participate in a loss-sharing arrangement with FNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing or recourse, our policy is to record such liabilities initially at fair value and subsequently reserve for estimated losses in accordance with guidance contained in applicable GAAP. 

Variable Interest Entities 

A VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets generally that either: 

&#8226; Does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity&#8217;s most significant economic activities through those voting rights or similar rights, or 

&#8226; Has equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. 

A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. 

VIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC 810 &#8211; Consolidation when we hold a variable interest in these entities. We consolidate a VIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of the VIE&#8217;s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we determine whether any changes occurred requiring a reassessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of an entity. 

See Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities for information about VIEs that we consolidate as well as those that we do not consolidate but in which we hold a significant variable interest. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

We provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential loans. These contracts are either purchased in the open market or retained as part of a loan securitization or loan sale. All acquired or originated servicing rights are measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the present value of the expected future net cash flows, including assumptions as to: 

&#8226; Deposit balances and interest rates for escrow and commercial reserve earnings, 

&#8226; Discount rates, 

&#8226; Estimated prepayment speeds, and 

&#8226; Estimated servicing costs. 

We measure commercial and residential MSRs at fair value in order to reduce any potential measurement mismatch between our economic hedges and the MSRs. We manage the risk by hedging the fair value of MSRs with derivatives and securities which are expected to increase in value when the value of the servicing right declines. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recognized as gains/(losses). The fair value of these servicing rights is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions. See Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for additional information. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. At least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management performs the goodwill impairment test at a reporting unit level. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 113 

PNC may first perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, PNC determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If PNC elects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or concludes via qualitative analysis that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount. The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flows and/or market comparability methodologies. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. See Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for additional information. 

Leases 

Lessor Arrangements 

We provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Finance leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased equipment, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. Lease residual values are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are included in Other noninterest income. Valuation adjustments on operating lease residuals are included in Other noninterest expense while valuation adjustments on the net investment of a direct financing or sales-type lease are included in Provision for credit losses. Prior to the adoption of CECL, valuation adjustments on lease residuals were included in Other noninterest expense. 

Lessee Arrangements 

We lease retail branches, datacenters, office space, land and equipment under operating and finance leases. At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and nonlease components of existing real estate leases and leases of advertising assets, such as signage, as a single lease component. Effective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease components of new lease agreements are accounted for separately. Lease components consist of fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease components consist of common-area maintenance costs. In addition, we elected the practical expedient to not apply the recognition requirements under the standard to short-term leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, we have elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to the term of the lease at the lease measurement date as our incremental borrowing rate to measure the right-of-use-asset and lease liability. 

See Note 7 Leases for additional information on our leasing arrangements. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate premises and equipment, net of salvage value, principally using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. 

We use estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment ranging from one to 10 years, and depreciate buildings over an estimated useful life of up to 40 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years or the respective lease terms, whichever is shorter. 

We purchase, as well as internally develop and customize, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the planning and post-development project stages are charged to Noninterest expense. Costs associated with designing software configuration and interfaces, installation, coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from one to 10 years. 

We review the remaining useful lives and carrying values of premises and equipment to determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate a change in useful life is warranted or if any impairment exists. 

Other Comprehensive Income 

Other comprehensive income, on an after-tax basis, primarily consists of unrealized gains or losses on debt securities, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plan liability adjustments. Details of each component are included in Note 13 Other Comprehensive Income. 

114 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

Treasury Stock 

We record common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the first-in, first-out basis. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the two-class method to determine income attributable to common shareholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities under the two-class method. Distributed dividends and dividend equivalents related to participating securities and an allocation of undistributed net income to participating securities reduce the amount of income attributable to common shareholders. In a period with a loss, no allocation will be made to the participating securities, as they do not have a contractual obligation to absorb losses. Income attributable to common shareholders is then divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. 

Diluted earnings per common share is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method. These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. For periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations, any potential dilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this scenario, no potential dilutive shares will be included in the continuing operations, discontinued operations or total earnings per common share calculations, even if overall net income is reported. See Note 14 Earnings Per Share for additional information. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The fair value of financial instruments and the methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts and financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected are detailed in Note 15 Fair Value. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

We use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risks inherent in our business activities, as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities. We manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures. 

We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net investment hedging relationship. For all other derivatives, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. 

We utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return, or general rights to reclaim, cash collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized. 

For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation. 

We formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy, before undertaking an accounting hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship. In addition, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For accounting hedge relationships, we formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. We assess effectiveness using statistical regression analysis. Where the critical terms of the derivative and hedged item match, effectiveness may be assessed qualitatively. 

For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges ( i.e ., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in LIBOR), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 115 

the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same income statement line as the hedged item. 

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges ( i.e ., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the gain or loss on derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to income in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect earnings and recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI. 

We discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period. 

We purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. For financial instruments not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, we assess, at inception of the transaction, if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and meets the definition of a derivative, the embedded derivative is recorded separately from the host contract with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value. 

We enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter into commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in Noninterest income. 

See Note 16 Financial Derivatives for additional information. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Thus, at the enactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured and the change is recognized in Income Tax expense. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets. Realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based upon all available positive and negative evidence. 

We use the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset. 

Revenue Recognition 

We earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: 

&#8226; Lending, 

&#8226; Securities portfolio, 

&#8226; Asset management, 

&#8226; Loan sales, loan securitizations, and servicing, 

&#8226; Brokerage services, 

&#8226; Sale of loans and securities, 

&#8226; Certain private equity activities, and 

&#8226; Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities. 

In addition, we earn fees and commissions from: 

&#8226; Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, 

&#8226; Deposit account services, 

&#8226; Merchant services, 

&#8226; Selling various insurance products, 

&#8226; Providing treasury management services, 

&#8226; Providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services, 

&#8226; Debit and credit card transactions, and 

&#8226; Participating in certain capital markets transactions. 

116 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized when earned. Brokerage fees and gains and losses on the sale of securities and certain derivatives are recognized on a trade-date basis. 

We record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest. 

We recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments where we have elected the fair value option. These financial instruments include certain commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, certain residential mortgage portfolio loans and resale agreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of residential and commercial MSRs. 

We recognize revenue from servicing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans for others as earned based on the specific contractual terms. These revenues are reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Consumer services. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange customer-related trading, as well as securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur or as services are provided. We generally recognize gains from the sale of loans upon meeting the derecognition criteria for transfers of financial assets. Mortgage revenue recognized is reported net of mortgage repurchase reserves. 

For the fee-based revenue within the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers , revenue is recognized when or as those services are transferred to the customer. See Note 24 Fee-Based Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information related to revenue within the scope of ASC 606.

Pending Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. 

On November 16, 2020, we announced a definitive agreement with BBVA, S.A. to acquire BBVA including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, for a fixed purchase price of $ 11.6 billion in cash. 

BBVA USA has over 600 branches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico. The transaction is expected to add approximately $ 102 billion in total assets, $ 86 billion of deposits and $ 66 billion of loans to PNC&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet and to close in mid-2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. 

Sale of Equity Investment in Blackrock, Inc. 

In May 2020, PNC completed the sale of its 31.6 million shares of BlackRock, Inc., common and preferred stock through a registered secondary offering at a price of $ 420 per share. In addition, BlackRock repurchased 2.65 million shares from PNC at a price of $ 414.96 per share. The total proceeds from the sale were $ 14.2 billion in cash, net of $ 0.2 billion in expenses, and resulted in a gain on sale of $ 4.3 billion. Additionally, PNC contributed 500,000 BlackRock shares to the PNC Foundation. 

Following the sale and donation, PNC has divested its entire investment in BlackRock and only holds shares of BlackRock stock in a fiduciary capacity for clients of PNC.

N OTE 3 I NVESTMENT S ECURITIES 

With the adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, credit losses on investment securities are required to be recognized 

through an allowance, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. The amortized cost basis of 

investment securities for which impairment had previously been recorded did not change upon adoption. 

We maintain the allowance for investment securities at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb 

expected credit losses on our portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for investment securities was $ 82 million and 

primarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in the available for sale portfolio and other debt securities in 

the held to maturity portfolio. The provision for credit losses on investment securities totaled $ 80 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

In the first quarter of 2020, upon the adoption of ASU 2019-04, we elected to transfer debt securities with an amortized cost of $ 16.2 billion and a fair value of $ 16.5 billion from the held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020, pursuant to the guidance in ASU 2020-04, we elected to transfer debt securities with an amortized cost of $ 49 million and a fair value of $ 48 million from the held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. 

See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of the CECL standard, including the methodologies 

used to determine the allowance for investment securities, and the adoption of ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2020-04.

(a) The accrued interest associated with our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios totaled $ 238 million and $ 5 million at December 31, 2020, respectively. These amounts are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

(b) Amortized cost is presented net of allowance of $ 79 million for securities available for sale and $ 3 million for securities held to maturity at December 31, 2020 in accordance with the CECL accounting standard. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional detail on the CECL accounting standard. 

(c) Credit ratings represent a primary credit quality indicator used to monitor and manage credit risk. As of December 31, 2020, 85 % of our securities held to maturity were rated AAA/AA. 

The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in Shareholders&#8217; equity as AOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized gains and losses are determined by taking the difference between the fair value of a security and its amortized cost, net of any allowance. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost less any allowance. Investment securities at December 31, 2020 included $ 0.2 billion of net unsettled purchases which represent non-cash investing activity, and accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The comparable amount for December 31, 2019 was $ 0.5 billion. 

Table 42 presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities available for sale that do not have an associated allowance for investment securities as of December 31, 2020. These securities are segregated between investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more, based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. All securities included in the table have been evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. As part of that assessment, as of December 31, 2020, we concluded that we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.

Loan Portfolio 

Our loan portfolio consists of two portfolio segments &#8211; Commercial and Consumer. Each of these segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk.

##TABLE_END 

See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information on our loan related policies. 

Credit Quality 

We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk within the loan portfolio based on our defined loan classes. In doing so, we use several credit quality indicators, including trends in delinquency rates, nonperforming status, analysis of PD and LGD ratings, updated credit scores, and originated and updated LTV ratios. 

The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. With the adoption of the CECL standard, accruing loans past due as of December 31, 2020 include PCD loans, while amounts as of December 31, 2019 excluded purchased impaired loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of this standard, including the discontinuation of purchased impaired loan accounting. 

The following table presents the composition and delinquency status of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Pursuant to the interagency guidance issued in April 2020 and in connection with the credit reporting rules from the CARES Act, the December 31, 2020 delinquency status of loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships aligns with the rules set forth for banks to report delinquency status to the credit agencies. These rules require that COVID-19 related loan modifications be reported as follows: 

&#8226; if current at the time of modification, the loan remains current throughout the modification period, 

&#8226; if delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was not made current as part of the modification, the loan maintains its reported delinquent status during the modification period, or 

&#8226; if delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was made current as part of the modification or became current during the modification period, the loan is reported as current. 

As a result, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as of December 31, 2020 based on the contractual terms of the loan, even where borrowers may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period. Loan modifications due to COVID-19 related hardships that permanently reduce either the contractual interest rate or the principal balance of a loan do not qualify for TDR relief under the CARES Act or the interagency guidance.

(g) Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance. 

(h) Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we accreted interest income over the expected life of the loans. Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate loans totaling $ 0.4 billion and Education loans totaling $ 0.2 billion at December 31, 2019. 

(i) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies.

(j) Net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans totaling $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 123 

In the normal course of business, we originate or purchase loan products with contractual characteristics that, when concentrated, may 

increase our exposure as a holder of those loan products. Possible product features that may create a concentration of credit risk would 

include a high original or updated LTV ratio, terms that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments 

above increases in market interest rates, and interest-only loans, among others. 

We originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. Such credit arrangements are usually designed to match borrower cash flow 

expectations (e.g., working capital lines, revolvers). These products are standard in the financial services industry and product features are considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that the interest-only feature may result in borrowers not 

being able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these product features create a concentration of 

credit risk. 

At December 31, 2020, we pledged $ 30.1 billion of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank and $ 69.0 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank as collateral for the ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were $ 16.9 billion and $ 68.0 billion, respectively. Amounts pledged reflect the unpaid principal balances. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans, however, when nonaccrual criteria is met interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. 

With the adoption of the CECL standard, nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2020 include PCD loans. Amounts as of December 31, 2019 excluded purchased impaired loans as we were accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of this standard and our nonperforming loan and lease policies. 

The following table presents our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(a) Excludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status. 

(b) Nonperforming loans for which there is no related ALLL totaled $ 0.8 billion at December 31, 2020, and is primarily comprised of loans with a valuation that exceeds the amortized cost basis. 

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the TDR section of this Note 4 for additional information on TDRs. 

Total nonperforming loans in Table 48 include TDRs of $ 0.9 billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and are excluded from nonperforming loans. 

Additional Credit Quality Indicators by Loan Class 

Commercial and Industrial 

For commercial and industrial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower&#8217;s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process. These ratings 

124 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

are reviewed and updated, generally at least once per year. For small balance homogeneous pools of commercial and industrial loans and leases, we apply scoring techniques to assist in determining the PD. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to commercial and industrial loans, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss severity in the event of default, reflects credit quality characteristics as of the reporting date and are used as inputs into our loss forecasting process. 

Based upon the amount of the lending arrangement and our risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written periodic reviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a market&#8217;s or business unit&#8217;s loan portfolio, focusing on those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is weakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal. 

Commercial Real Estate 

We manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to commercial and industrial loans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. 

As with the commercial and industrial loan class, a formal schedule of periodic reviews is also performed to assess market/geographic risk and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these overviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, such as adverse changes in risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and facilitate actions to mitigate such risks. 

Equipment Lease Financing 

We manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease financing loan class similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. 

Based upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established practices to review such credit risk more frequently if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance as applicable.

(a) Loans in our commercial portfolio are classified as Pass Rated or Criticized based on the regulatory definitions, which are driven by the PD and LGD ratings that we assign. The Criticized classification includes loans that were rated special mention, substandard or doubtful as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Home Equity and Residential Real Estate 

We use several credit quality indicators, including delinquency information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit scores, originated and updated LTV ratios, to monitor and manage credit risk within the home equity and residential real estate loan classes. A summary of credit quality indicators follows: 

Delinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans. See Table 47 for additional information. 

Nonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of nonperforming loans for home equity and residential real estate loans. See Table 47 for additional information. 

Credit Scores: We use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit scores for home equity and residential real estate loans at least quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes. 

LTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and subordinate lien positions): At least quarterly, we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes. 

We use a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes ( e.g. , line management, loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data limitations, it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management&#8217;s assumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service provider, HPI changes will be incorporated in arriving at management&#8217;s estimate of updated LTV). 

Updated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models, broker price opinions, HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. We generally utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-party, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of 

126 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

the calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we refine our methodology.

Automobile, Credit Card, Education and Other Consumer 

We monitor a variety of credit quality information in the management of these consumer loan classes. For all loan types, we generally use a combination of internal loan parameters as well as an updated FICO score. We use FICO scores as a primary credit quality indicator for automobile and credit card loans, as well as non-government guaranteed or non-insured education loans and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit metrics, such as delinquency status, are heavily relied upon as credit quality indicators for government guaranteed or insured education loans and consumer loans to high net worth individuals, as internal credit metrics are more relevant than FICO scores for these types of loans. 

Along with the monitoring of delinquency trends and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are obtained at least quarterly along with a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Loans that have been restructured for COVID-19 related hardships and meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not categorized as TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to TDRs. 

Table 52 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs as well as the change in the loans&#8217; balance as a result of becoming a TDR during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. The Principal Forgiveness TDR category includes principal forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category includes reduced interest rate and interest deferral. The Other TDR category primarily includes consumer borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, as well as postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and contractual extensions for both consumer and commercial borrowers. 

In some cases, there have been multiple concessions granted on one loan. This is most common within the commercial loan portfolio. When there have been multiple concessions granted in the commercial loan portfolio, the principal forgiveness concession was prioritized for purposes of determining the inclusion in Table 52. Second in priority would be rate reduction. In the event that multiple concessions are granted on a consumer loan, concessions resulting from discharge from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy without formal affirmation of the loan obligations to us would be prioritized and included in the Other type of concession in Table 52. After that, consumer loan concessions would follow the previously discussed priority of concessions for the commercial loan portfolio.

(f) Represents the recorded investment of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable. 

After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. Loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the period totaled $ 0.1 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Allowance for Credit Losses

The $ 2.2 billion increase in the ACL since January 1, 2020 was driven by the following factors in the commercial and consumer portfolios: 

&#8226; Commercial reserves increased $ 1.9 billion attributable to the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on credit quality and loan growth. 

&#8226; Consumer reserves increased $ 0.3 billion primarily reflecting the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic.

Loan Sale and Servicing Activities 

We have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. These transfers have occurred through Agency securitization, Non-agency securitization, and loan sale transactions. Agency securitizations consist of securitization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA and FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through SPEs that they sponsor. As an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of VA insured loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market. In Non-agency securitizations, we have transferred loans into securitization SPEs. In other instances, third-party investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale transactions and in certain instances have subsequently sold these loans into securitization SPEs. Securitization SPEs utilized in the Agency and Non-agency securitization transactions are VIEs. 

Our continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs. 

Depending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors. Servicing responsibilities typically consist of collecting and remitting monthly borrower principal and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and, in certain instances, funding of servicing advances. Servicing advances, which are generally reimbursable, are made for principal and interest and collateral protection and are carried in Other assets at cost. 

We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair Value for further discussion of our servicing rights. 

Certain loans transferred to the Agencies contain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an option to repurchase at par individual delinquent loans that meet certain criteria. In other limited cases, GNMA has granted us the right to repurchase current loans when we intend to modify the borrower&#8217;s interest rate under established guidelines. When we have the unilateral ability to repurchase a loan, effective control over the loan has been regained and we recognize an asset (in either Loans or Loans held for sale) and a corresponding liability (in Other borrowed funds) on the balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan. 

The Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs that are purchased and held on our balance sheet are typically purchased in the secondary market. We do not retain any credit risk on our Agency mortgage-backed security positions as FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for GNMA) guarantee losses of principal and interest. 

We also have involvement with certain Agency and Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs where we have not transferred commercial mortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by independent third-parties and the loans held by these entities were purchased exclusively from other third-parties. Generally, our involvement with these SPEs is as servicer with servicing activities consistent with those described above. 

We recognize a liability for our loss exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to possible breaches of representations and warranties and also for loss sharing arrangements (recourse obligations) with the Agencies. Other than providing temporary liquidity under servicing advances and our loss exposure associated with our repurchase and recourse obligations, we have not provided nor are we required to provide any type of credit support, guarantees or commitments to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors in these transactions.

Table 57 presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan, where the repurchase price exceeded the loan&#8217;s fair value, due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans. The estimate of losses related to breaches in representations and warranties was insignificant at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information. 

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) 

We are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs. We assess VIEs for consolidation based upon the accounting policies described in Note 1 Accounting Policies. Our consolidated VIEs were insignificant at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. We have not provided additional financial support to these entities which we are not contractually required to provide. 

The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 58 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal

Mortgage-Backed Securitizations 

In connection with each Agency and Non-agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securitization discussed above, we evaluate each SPE utilized in these transactions for consolidation. In performing these assessments, we evaluate our level of continuing involvement in these transactions as the nature of our involvement ultimately determines whether or not we hold a variable interest and/or are the primary beneficiary of the SPE. Factors we consider in our consolidation assessment include the significance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii) our holdings of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the rights of third-party variable interest holders. 

The first step in our assessment is to determine whether we hold a variable interest in the securitization SPE. We hold variable interests in Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs through our holding of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by the SPEs and/or our recourse obligations. Each SPE in which we hold a variable interest is evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For Agency securitization transactions, our contractual role as servicer does not give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPEs. Thus, we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities. For Non-agency securitization transactions, we would be the primary beneficiary to the extent our servicing activities give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPE and we hold a more than insignificant variable interest in the entity. 

Details about the Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs where we hold a variable interest and are not the primary beneficiary are included in Table 58. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these SPEs is the carrying value of the mortgage-backed securities, servicing assets, servicing advances and our liabilities associated with our recourse obligations. Creditors of the securitization SPEs have no recourse to our assets or general credit. 

Tax Credit Investments and Other 

For tax credit investments in which we do not have the right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, we are not the primary beneficiary and thus do not consolidate the entity. These investments are disclosed in Table 58. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any potential tax credit recapture. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded impairment, partnership results or amortization for qualifying low income housing tax credit investments when applicable. For all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of December 31, 2020, we had a liability for unfunded commitments of $ 1.1 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects which is reflected in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Table 58 also includes our involvement in lease financing transactions with LLCs engaged in solar power generation that, to a large extent, provided returns in the form of tax credits. The outstanding financings and operating lease assets are reflected as Loans and Other assets, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas related liabilities are reported in Deposits and Other liabilities. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 135 

We make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or LLCs. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During 2020 we recognized $ 0.2 billion of amortization, $ 0.2 billion of tax credits and less than $ 0.1 billion of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes.

Based on the results of our analysis, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2020, 2019 or 2018. 

See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2017-04, which simplified the goodwill impairment test. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

We recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others as an intangible asset when the servicing income we receive is more than adequate compensation. MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. MSRs totaled $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 1.6 billion at December 31, 2019, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value. 

Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights 

We recognize gains/(losses) on changes in the fair value of commercial MSRs. Commercial MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of commercial MSRs with securities, derivative instruments and resale agreements which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of commercial MSRs decreases (or increases). 

The fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and expectations. 

Changes in the commercial MSRs follow:

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 

Residential MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of residential MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of residential MSRs decreases (or increases). 

The fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions. 

Changes in the residential MSRs follow:

Sensitivity Analysis 

The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of December 31, 2020 are shown in Tables 62 and 63. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate. 

A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in Tables 62 and 63. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

Fees from mortgage loan servicing, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees were $ 0.5 billion for each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported within Noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.

PNC enters into both lessor and lessee arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see Note 1 Accounting Policies and for additional details on our equipment lease financing receivables see Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Lessor Arrangements 

PNC&#8217;s lessor arrangements primarily consist of direct financing, sales-type and operating leases for equipment. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. 

The following table provides details on our income from lessor arrangements:

Operating lease assets were $ 1.0 billion and accumulated depreciation was $ 0.2 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to operating lease assets of $ 1.1 billion and accumulated depreciation of $ 0.3 billion at December 31, 2019.

Lessee Arrangements 

We lease retail branches, datacenters, office space, land and equipment under operating and finance leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to 47 years, some of which may include options to renew the leases for up to 99 years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases prior to the end date. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased asset. The exercise of lease renewal, termination and purchase options is at our sole discretion. 

We recognize on the balance sheet all leases with lease terms greater than twelve months as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset. At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and nonlease components of existing real estate leases and leases of advertising assets, such as signage, as a single lease component. Effective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease components of new lease agreements are accounted for separately. Lease components consist of fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease components consist of common-area maintenance costs. In addition, we elected the practical expedient to not apply the recognition requirements under the standard to short-term leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, we have elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to the term of the lease at the lease measurement date as our incremental borrowing rate to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability. 

Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of revenue and others include rental payments if certain bank deposit levels are met. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Subleases to third parties were not material at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

PNC Capital Trust C, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., owns junior subordinated debentures issued by PNC with a carrying value of $ 205 million. In June 1998, PNC Capital Trust C issued $ 200 million of trust preferred securities which bear interest at an annual rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 57 basis points. The trust preferred securities are currently redeemable by PNC Capital Trust C at par. In accordance with GAAP, the financial statements of the Trust are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 

The obligations of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as the parent of the Trust, when taken collectively, are the equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of the Trust under the terms of the trust preferred securities. Such guarantee is subordinate in right of payment in the same manner as other junior subordinated debt. There are certain restrictions on our overall ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries. For additional disclosure on these funding restrictions, see Note 20 Regulatory Matters. 

We are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments, in connection with the outstanding junior subordinated debentures. Generally, if (i) there is an event of default under the debentures, (ii) we elect to defer interest on the debentures, (iii) we exercise our right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities, or (iv) there is a default under our guarantee of such payment obligations, subject to certain limited exceptions, we would be unable during the period of such default or deferral to make payments on our debt securities that rank equal or junior to the debentures as well as to make payments on our equity securities, including dividend payments.

These amounts reflect estimates based on availability of financial information from insurance carriers. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate maximum exposure amount for reinsurance agreements was zero as all underlying insurance policies were cancelled and/or sold. 

(c) We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations. 

(d) Includes $ 1.1 billion and $ 0.6 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Commitments to Extend Credit 

Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee and generally contain termination clauses in the event the customer&#8217;s credit quality deteriorates. 

Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit 

We issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Approximately 96 % of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass at December 31, 2020, with the remainder rated as Criticized. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Criticized indicates a higher degree of risk. 

142 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on December 31, 2020 had terms ranging from less than one year to six years . 

As of December 31, 2020, assets of $ 1.1 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers&#8217; other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in standby letters of credit was $ 0.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Other Shareholders&#8217; Equity Matters 

At December 31, 2020, we had reserved approximately 83 million common shares to be issued in connection with certain stock plans. 

On April 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of 100 million shares of PNC common stock, which may be purchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, effective July 1, 2019. In June 2019, we announced share repurchase programs of up to $ 4.3 billion for the four quarter period beginning with the third quarter of 2019, in accordance with PNC&#8217;s 2019 capital plan. In January 2020, we announced an increase to these programs to repurchase up to an additional $ 1.0 billion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of 2020. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic. We continued the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 with the exception of employee benefit-related purchases in the third quarter, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s special capital distribution restrictions. Under these program authorizations we repurchased 11.0 million shares in 2020 and 25.9 million shares in 2019. A maximum amount of 75.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the new stock program authorization at December 31, 2020. In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date, expected to be mid-2021.

Fair Value Measurement 

We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date, and is determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 

&#8226; Level 1: Fair value is determined using a quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities may include debt securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury securities that are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 

&#8226; Level 2: Fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. The majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities and listed derivative contracts with quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active, and certain debt and equity securities and over-the-counter derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing model without significant unobservable inputs. 

&#8226; Level 3: Fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the significant valuation inputs are not observable and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

We characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information. Inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks, including credit risk, as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value, by their nature, result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 inherently require the use of various assumptions, estimates and judgments when measuring their fair value. As observable market activity is commonly not available to use when estimating the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities, we must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques. These techniques include the use of a variety of inputs/assumptions including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates or other relevant inputs across the entire population of our Level 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the significant underlying factors or assumptions (either an increase or a decrease) in any of these areas underlying our estimates may have resulted in a significant increase/decrease in the Level 3 fair value measurement of a particular asset and/or liability from period to period. 

Any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control testing processes. Our Model Risk Management Group reviews significant models on at least an annual basis. In addition, the Valuation Committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the results of independent valuation reviews and processes for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

&#160; 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 

We account for certain residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the related hedges. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2. 

Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 

We account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value. We determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale based upon discounted cash flows. Fair value is determined using sale valuation assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 147 

Valuation assumptions may include observable inputs based on the benchmark interest rate swap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales transactions. The significant unobservable input for commercial mortgage loans held for sale, excluding those to be sold to agencies, is management&#8217;s assumption of the spread applied to the benchmark rate. The spread over the benchmark curve includes management&#8217;s assumptions of the impact of credit and liquidity risk. Significant increases (decreases) in the spread applied to the benchmark would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) asset value. The wide range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the varying risk and underlying property characteristics within our portfolio. Based on the significance of the unobservable input we classified this portfolio as Level 3. 

For loans to be sold to agencies with servicing retained, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated servicing cash flows, which is an unobservable input. This adjustment is not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in the input to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, commercial mortgage loans held for sale to agencies are classified as Level 2. 

Securities Available for Sale and Trading Securities 

Securities accounted for at fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios. We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. The majority of securities were priced by third-party vendors. The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. We monitor and validate the reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews, including detailed reviews of the assumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price individual securities, and through price validation testing. Securities not priced by one of our pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote, which are also subject to price validation testing. Price validation testing is performed independent of the risk-taking function and involves corroborating the prices received from third-party vendors and dealers with prices from another third party or through other sources, such as internal valuations or sales of similar securities. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security. 

Securities are classified within the fair value hierarchy after giving consideration to the activity level in the market for the security type and the observability of the inputs used to determine the fair value. When a quoted price in an active market exists for the identical security, this price is used to determine fair value and the security is classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. 

When a quoted price in an active market for the identical security is not available, fair value is estimated using either an alternative market approach, such as a recent trade or matrix pricing, or an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow pricing model. If the inputs to the valuation are based primarily on market observable information, then the security is classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency debt securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities collateralized by non-mortgage-related corporate and consumer loans, and other debt securities. Level 2 securities are predominantly priced by third parties, either by a pricing vendor or dealer. 

In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Securities classified as Level 3 consist primarily of non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by first- and second-lien residential mortgage loans. Fair value for these securities is primarily estimated using pricing obtained from third-party vendors. In some cases, fair value is estimated using a dealer quote, by reference to prices of securities of a similar vintage and collateral type or by reference to recent sales of similar securities. Market activity for these security types is limited with little price transparency. As a result, these securities are generally valued by the third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates significant unobservable inputs and observable market activity where available. Significant inputs to the valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss assumptions (default rate and loss severity) and discount rates that are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those assumptions in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 

Certain infrequently traded debt securities within Other debt securities available for sale and Trading securities are also classified in Level 3 and are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85. The significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses and a discount for liquidity risk. These inputs are incorporated into the fair value measurement by either increasing the spread over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity discount to the par value of the security. Significant increases (decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk could have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate. 

Loans 

Loans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of residential mortgage loans. These loans are generally valued similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are classified as Level 2. However, similar to residential mortgage loans held for sale, if these loans are repurchased and unsalable, they are classified as Level 3. In addition, repurchased VA loans, where only a portion of the principal will be reimbursed, are classified as Level 3. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation based on our historical loss rate. We have elected to account for certain home equity lines of credit at fair value. These loans are classified as 

148 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

Level 3. Significant inputs to the valuation of these loans include credit and liquidity discount, cumulative default rate, loss severity and gross discount rate and are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these assumptions would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 

Equity Investments 

Equity investments includes money market mutual funds as well as direct and indirect private equity investments. Money market mutual funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities and classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such investments. Various valuation techniques are used for direct investments, including multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. A multiple of adjusted earnings calculation is the valuation technique utilized most frequently and is the most significant unobservable input used in such calculation. Significant decreases (increases) in the multiple of earnings could have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Direct equity investments are classified as Level 3. 

Indirect investments are not redeemable; however, we receive distributions over the life of the partnerships from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee, which we expect to occur over the next 10 years. We value indirect investments in private equity funds using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient as provided in the financial statements that we receive from fund managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager-provided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. Indirect investments valued using NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) 

MSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs valuation model reflect management&#8217;s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales of MSRs do occur and can offer some market insight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available. 

Residential MSRs 

As a benchmark for the reasonableness of our residential MSRs fair value, we obtained opinions of value from independent brokers. These brokers provided a range (+/- 10 bps) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the secondary market and any recently executed servicing transactions. We compare our internally-developed residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers&#8217; ranges, management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted. For the periods presented, our residential MSRs value did not fall outside of the brokers&#8217; ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are constant prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve. Significant increases (decreases) in prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would have resulted in lower (higher) fair market value of residential MSRs. 

Commercial MSRs 

The fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors. Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs and the limited availability of market pricing, commercial MSRs are classified as Level 3. Significant increases (decreases) in constant prepayment rates and discount rates would have resulted in significantly lower (higher) commercial MSR value determined based on current market conditions and expectations. 

Financial Derivatives 

Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. The majority of derivatives that we enter into are executed over-the-counter and are valued using internal models. These derivatives are primarily classified as Level 2, as the readily observable market inputs to these models are validated to external sources, such as industry pricing services, or are corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. Level 2 financial derivatives are primarily estimated using a combination of Eurodollar future prices and observable benchmark interest rate swaps to construct projected discounted cash flows. 

Financial derivatives that are priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs related to interest rate contracts include probability of funding of residential mortgage loan commitments and estimated servicing cash flows of commercial and residential mortgage loan commitments. Probability of default and loss severity are the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of risk participation agreements. The fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 149 

related to these interest rate contract financial derivatives as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85 of this Note 15. 

In connection with the sales of portions of our Visa Class B common shares, we entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of the shares to retain any future risk of decreases in the conversion rate of Class B common shares to Class A common shares resulting from increases in the escrow funded by Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of specified litigation (see Note 21 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also require PNC to make periodic payments based on the market price of the Class A common shares at a fixed rate of interest (in certain cases subject to step-up provisions) until the Visa litigation is resolved. An increase in the estimated length of litigation resolution date, a decrease in the estimated conversion rate, or an increase in the estimated growth rate of the Class A share price would have had a negative impact on the fair value of the swaps and vice versa. 

The fair values of our derivatives include a credit valuation adjustment to reflect our own and our counterparties&#8217; nonperformance risk. Our credit valuation adjustment is computed using credit default swap spreads, in conjunction with internal historical recovery observations. 

Other Assets and Liabilities 

Other assets held at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include assets related to PNC&#8217;s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans. 

The assets related to PNC&#8217;s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans primarily consist of a prepaid forward contract referencing an amount of shares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and fixed income funds, and are valued based on the underlying investments. These assets are valued either by reference to the market price of PNC&#8217;s stock or by using the quoted market prices for investments other than PNC&#8217;s stock and are classified in Levels 1 and 2. 

All Level 3 other assets and liabilities are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85 in this Note 15. 

Other Borrowed Funds 

Other borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities sold short which are classified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds also includes the related liability for certain repurchased loans for which we have elected the fair value option and are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, consistent with the level classification of the corresponding loans. All Level 3 amounts are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85 in this Note 15.

(f) Net gains (losses) realized and unrealized included in earnings related to Level 3 assets and liabilities included amortization and accretion. The amortization and accretion amounts were included in Interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement and the remaining net gains (losses) realized and unrealized were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

(g) Net unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

An instrument&#8217;s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels.

(a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments. 

(b) The assumed yield spread over the benchmark curve for each instrument is generally intended to incorporate non-interest rate risks, such as credit and liquidity risks. 

(c) Consensus pricing refers to fair value estimates that are generally internally developed using information such as dealer quotes or other third-party provided valuations or comparable asset prices. 

(d) Represents the aggregate amount of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that are individually and in the aggregate insignificant. The amount includes certain financial derivative assets and liabilities, trading securities, other securities, residential mortgage loans held for sale, other assets, other borrowed funds and other liabilities. 

(e) Consisted of total Level 3 assets of $ 5.1 billion and total Level 3 liabilities of $ 0.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 5.4 billion and $ 0.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Financial Assets Accounted for at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

We may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment and are included in Table 86. 

Nonaccrual Loans 

Nonaccrual loans represent the fair value of those loans which have been adjusted due to impairment. The impairment is primarily based on the appraised value of the collateral. 

Appraisals are obtained by licensed or certified appraisers at least annually and more recently in certain instances. All third-party appraisals are reviewed and any adjustments to the initial appraisal are incorporated into the final issued appraisal report. In instances where an appraisal is not obtained, collateral value is determined consistent with external third-party appraisal standards by an internal person independent of the asset manager. 

OREO and Foreclosed Assets 

The carrying value of OREO and foreclosed assets includes valuation adjustments recorded subsequent to the transfer to OREO and foreclosed assets. These valuation adjustments are based on the fair value less cost to sell of the property. Fair value is based on appraised value or sales price and the appraisal process for OREO and foreclosed assets is the same as described above for nonaccrual loans. 

Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets consists of buildings for which valuation adjustments were recorded during the period. A facility classified as held and used is impaired to the extent its carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. Valuation adjustments on buildings held 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 155 

for sale are based on the fair value of the property less an estimated cost to sell and are recorded subsequent to the transfer of the asset to held for sale status. Fair value is determined either by a third-party appraisal, recent sales offer, changes in market or property conditions, or, where we have agreed to sell the building to a third party, the contractual sales price. Impairment on these long-lived assets is recorded in Other noninterest expense on our Consolidated Income Statement. 

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis follow:

We elect the fair value option to account for certain financial instruments. For more information on these financial instruments for which the fair value option election has been made, refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 15. These financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses from initial measurement and any changes in fair value are subsequently recognized in earnings. 

Interest income related to changes in the fair values of these financial instruments is recorded on the Consolidated Income Statement in Other interest income, except for certain Residential mortgage loans, for which income is also recorded in Loan interest income. Changes in the value on prepaid forward contracts included in Other assets is reported in Noninterest expense and interest expense on the Other borrowed funds is reported in Borrowed funds interest expense. 

Fair values and aggregate unpaid principal balances of items for which we elected the fair value option follow :

Additional Fair Value Information Related to Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 

This section presents fair value information for all other financial instruments that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value amounts for these financial instruments. 

Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning Deposits with Banks 

Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts for Cash and due from banks and Interest-earning deposits with banks reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value. 

Securities Held to Maturity 

We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. Refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 15 for additional information relating to our pricing processes and procedures. 

Net Loans 

Fair values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows incorporating assumptions about prepayment rates, net credit losses and servicing fees. Nonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated recovery value. Loans are presented net of the ALLL. 

Other Assets 

Other assets includes accrued interest receivable, cash collateral, federal funds sold and resale agreements, certain loans held for sale, and FHLB and FRB stock. The aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and FRB stock was $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which approximated fair value at each date. 

Deposits 

For time deposits, fair values are estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities. For deposits with no defined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand and interest-bearing money market and savings deposits, carrying values approximate fair values. 

Borrowed Funds 

For short-term borrowed funds, including federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements and certain other short-term borrowings and payables, carrying values approximated fair values. For long-term borrowed funds, quoted market prices are used, when available, to estimate fair value. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar terms and maturities. 

Unfunded Lending Related Commitments and Letters of Credit 

The fair value of unfunded lending related commitments and letters of credit is determined from a market participant&#8217;s view including the impact of changes in interest rates and credit. We establish a liability on these facilities related to the creditworthiness of our counterparty. 

Other Liabilities 

Other liabilities includes interest-bearing cash collateral held related to derivatives and other accrued liabilities. Due to its short-term nature, the carrying value of Other liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 157 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

N OTE 16 F INANCIAL D ERIVATIVES 

We use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risks inherent in our business activities, as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities. We manage these risks as part of our overall asset and liability management process and through our credit policies and procedures. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract. 

Derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not recorded on the balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments. 

The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us:

All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features section of this Note 16. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives. Further discussion on how derivatives are accounted for is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies. 

Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments 

Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives to be recognized in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings impact of the hedged items. 

Fair Value Hedges 

We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. For these cash flow hedges, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps and forward contracts are recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line as the hedged cash flows. 

In the 12 months that follow December 31, 2020, we expect to reclassify net derivative gains of $ 276 million pretax, or $ 213 million after-tax, from AOCI to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is ten years .

Net Investment Hedges 

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all periods presented. Net gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were $( 24 ) million at both 2020 and 2019 and $ 76 million in 2018.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 

Residential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market, and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the loans and commitments due to interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities, as well as U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options. Gains and losses on the loans and commitments held for sale and the derivatives used to economically hedge them are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

Residential mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value influenced primarily by changes in interest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income. 

Commercial mortgage loans held for sale and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge these loans and commitments from changes in fair value due to interest rate risk include forward loan sale contracts and interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the commitments, loans and derivatives are included in Other noninterest income. Derivatives used to economically hedge the change in value of commercial mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps and options. Gains or losses on these derivatives are included in Corporate services noninterest income. 

The residential and commercial mortgage loan commitments associated with loans to be sold which are accounted for as derivatives are valued based on the estimated fair value of the underlying loan and the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment. The fair value also takes into account the fair value of the embedded servicing right. 

We offer derivatives to our customers in connection with their risk management needs. These derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and foreign exchange contracts. We primarily manage our market risk exposure from customer transactions by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains and losses on customer-related derivatives are included in Other noninterest income. 

Included in the customer, mortgage banking risk management, and other risk management portfolios are written interest-rate caps and floors entered into with customers and for risk management purposes. We receive an upfront premium from the counterparty and are obligated to make payments to the counterparty if the underlying market interest rate rises above or falls below a certain level designated in the contract. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions. 

We have entered into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. The notional amount of risk participation agreements sold was $ 7.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 8.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Assuming all underlying third party customers referenced in the swap contracts defaulted, the exposure from these agreements would be $ 0.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 0.3 billion at December 31, 2019 based on the fair value of the underlying swaps.

Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features 

We generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party&#8217;s net position. In certain cases, minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is exchanged. Collateral is typically exchanged daily on unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the positions with the counterparty as of the preceding day. Collateral representing initial margin, which is based on potential future exposure, is also required to be pledged by us in relation to derivative instruments with central clearing house counterparties. Any cash collateral exchanged with counterparties under these master netting agreements is also netted, when appropriate, against the applicable derivative fair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the fair value of any securities held or pledged is not included in the net presentation on the balance sheet. In order for derivative instruments under a master netting agreement to be eligible for closeout netting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable upon an event of default, including upon an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of the counterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in such circumstances. 

Table 94 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values. 

Table 94 includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and OTC derivatives cleared through a central clearing house. OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or directly cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by the ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable master netting agreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. OTC cleared derivative instruments are typically settled in cash each day based on the prior day value.

In addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits, and monitoring procedures. 

At December 31, 2020, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $ 2.3 billion under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $ 1.9 billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise, securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet. 

Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on December 31, 2020 was $ 1.6 billion for which we had posted collateral of $ 1.4 billion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been required

Pension and Postretirement Plans 

We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Earnings credit percentages for those employees who were plan participants on December 31, 2009 are frozen at the level earned to that point. Earnings credits for all employees who became participants on or after January 1, 2010 are a flat 3 % of eligible compensation. All plan participants earn interest credits on their cash balances based on 30-year Treasury securities rates with those who were participants at December 31, 2009 earning a minimum rate. New participants on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to the minimum rate. Beginning in 2018, the plan provides for a minimum annual earnings credit amount of $ 2,000 , subject to eligibility criteria. Pension contributions to the plan are typically based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Assets of the qualified pension plan are held in a separate Trust. 

We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded. Contributions from PNC and, in the case of the postretirement benefit plans, participant contributions cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plan provides benefits to certain retirees that are at least actuarially equivalent to those provided by Medicare Part D and accordingly, we receive a federal subsidy. PNC has established a VEBA to partially fund postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations. 

We use a measurement date of December 31 for plan assets and benefit obligations. The qualified pension plan assets and benefit obligation were re-measured as of January 31, 2019 as a result of a plan amendment. 

A reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for the qualified pension plan follows :

PNC Pension Plan Assets 

The long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets in our qualified pension plan (the Plan) is to: 

&#8226; Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries; 

&#8226; Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan; 

&#8226; Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis; and 

&#8226; Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate level of risk. 

The Plan&#8217;s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts under the dynamic asset allocation strategy based on factors such as the Plan&#8217;s funded status, the named investment fiduciary&#8217;s view of return on equities relative to long term expectations, the named investment fiduciary&#8217;s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and other relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to participants and beneficiaries. Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility required by the dynamic allocation policy. 

166 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

The asset strategy allocations for the Plan at the end of 2020 and 2019, and the target allocation range at the end of 2020, by asset category, are as follows. 

Table 96: Asset Strategy Allocations 

##TABLE_START &#160; Target Allocation Range Percentage of Plan Assets by Strategy at December 31 &#160; 2020 2019 Asset Category Domestic Equity 15 &#160;&#8211; 40 %

100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END

The asset category represents the allocation of Plan assets in accordance with the investment objective of each of the Plan&#8217;s investment managers. Certain domestic equity investment managers utilize derivatives and fixed income securities as described in their Investment Management Agreements to achieve their investment objective under the Investment Policy Statement. Other investment managers may invest in eligible securities outside of their assigned asset category to meet their investment objectives. The actual percentage of the fair value of total Plan assets held as of December 31, 2020 for equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate and all other assets are 61 %, 21 %, 5 % and 13 %, respectively. 

We believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target percentages due to market movement, cash flows, investment manager performance and implementation of shifts under the dynamic asset allocation policy. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of the Trust. However, frequent rebalancing of the asset allocation targets may result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust&#8217;s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above. 

In addition to being diversified across asset classes, the Trust is diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the Trust. 

Where investment strategies permit the use of derivatives and/or currency management, language is incorporated in the managers&#8217; guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset allocation changes in a cost effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers&#8217; investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are to be used only in circumstances where they offer the most efficient economic means of improving the risk/reward profile of the portfolio.

Fair Value Measurements 

As further described in Note 15 Fair Value, GAAP establishes the framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. 

A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows: ##TABLE_START Asset Valuation Methodology Money market funds &#8226; Valued at the net asset value of the shares held by the pension plan at year end. 

U.S. government and agency securities Corporate debt Common stock &#8226; Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. 

&#8226; If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Such securities are generally classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy but may be a Level 3 depending on the level of liquidity and activity in the market for the security. 

Mutual funds &#8226; Valued based on third-party pricing of the fund which is not actively traded. 

Other investments 

Derivative financial instruments 

Group annuity contracts 

Preferred stock 

&#8226; Derivative financial instruments - recorded at estimated fair value as determined by third-party appraisals and pricing models. 

&#8226; Group annuity contracts - measured at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the credit-worthiness of the issuer. 

&#8226; Preferred stock - Valued at the closing price reported on an active market on which the securities are traded. 

Investments measured at NAV Collective trust fund investments Limited partnerships &#8226; Collective trust fund investments - Valued based upon the units of such collective trust fund held by the Plan at year end multiplied by the respective unit value. The unit value of the collective trust fund is based upon significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted prices in an active market. The underlying investments of the collective trust funds consist primarily of equity securities, debt obligations, short-term investments, and other marketable securities. Due to the nature of these securities, there are no unfunded commitments or redemption restrictions. 

&#8226; Limited partnerships - Valued by investment managers based on recent financial information used to estimate fair value. The unit value of limited partnerships is based upon significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted marked prices in an active market. 

##TABLE_END 

These methods may result in fair value calculations that may not be indicative of net realizable values or future fair values. Furthermore, while the pension plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan&#8217;s assets at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

(a) Rate disclosed is for the qualified pension plan. 

(b) Rate is applicable only to the postretirement benefit plans. 

The discount rates are determined independently for each plan by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid under each plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. For this analysis, 10 % of bonds with the highest yields and 40 % with the lowest yields were removed from the bond universe. 

&#160; 

The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, &#8220;long-term&#8221; refers to the period over which the plan&#8217;s projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. We also examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies. Taking into account all of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2020 was 5.50 %. We are reducing our expected long-term return on assets to 4.55 % for determining pension cost for 2021. This decision was made after considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective equity and fixed income returns. 

170 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

With all other assumptions held constant, a 0.50 % decline in the discount rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in net periodic benefit cost in 2020 and to be recognized in 2021 for each of the qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans. 

Defined Contribution Plans 

The ISP is a qualified defined contribution plan that covers all of our eligible employees. Newly-hired full time employees and part-time employees who are eligible to participate in the ISP are automatically enrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal to 4 % of eligible compensation in the absence of an affirmative election otherwise. Employee benefits expense related to the ISP was $ 147 million in 2020, $ 139 million in 2019 and $ 139 million in 2018, representing cash contributed to the ISP by PNC. 

The ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an employee stock ownership feature. Employee contributions are invested in a number of investment options, including pre-mixed portfolios and individual core funds, available under the ISP at the direction of the employee.

We have long-term incentive award plans (Incentive Plans) that provide for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, incentive shares/performance units, restricted share units, other share-based awards and dollar-denominated awards to executives and, other than incentive stock options, to non-employee directors. Certain Incentive Plan awards may be paid in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We typically grant a substantial portion of our stock-based compensation awards during the first quarter of each year. 

Incentive/Performance Share Unit Awards and Restricted Share Unit Awards 

The fair value of nonvested incentive/performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock on the date of grant with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. The value of certain incentive/performance unit awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals. Additionally, certain incentive/performance unit awards could require subsequent adjustment due to certain discretionary risk review triggers. 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 150.23 , $ 117.53 and $ 149.38 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of incentive/performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 213 million, $ 218 million and $ 254 million, respectively. We recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or performance periods for each type of program.

Some federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are from acquired entities and utilization is subject to various statutory limitations. We anticipate that we will be able to fully utilize our carryforwards for federal tax purposes, but we have recorded an insignificant valuation allowance against certain state tax carryforwards as of December 31, 2020. 

Retained earnings included $ 0.1 billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 in allocations for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided.

In addition, we are under continuous examinations by various state taxing authorities. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities for periods before 2013 . For all open audits, any potential adjustments have been considered in establishing our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020. 

Our policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense. For 2020 and 2019, the amount of gross interest and penalties was insignificant. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related amounts of accrued interest and penalties were also insignificant.

We are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state and foreign agencies and undergo periodic examinations by such regulatory authorities. 

The ability to undertake new business initiatives (including acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution&#8217;s capital strength. 

As of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring Rules became effective for PNC. The most significant changes involve the election to exclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital and higher thresholds used to calculate CET1 capital deductions. 

On March 27, 2020, the regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule delaying the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming 

from implementing the CECL standard. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three years. PNC and PNC Bank have elected the five-year transition period effective March 31, 2020. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, PNC and PNC Bank, our domestic banking subsidiary, were both considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements.

(a) Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during both 2020 and 2019. 

The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following: 

&#8226; Capital needs, 

&#8226; Laws and regulations, 

&#8226; Corporate policies, 

&#8226; Contractual restrictions, and 

&#8226; Other factors. 

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank without prior regulatory approval was approximately $ 3.1 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Under federal law, a bank subsidiary generally may not extend credit to, or engage in other types of covered transactions (including the purchase of assets) with, the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not 

174 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

substantially the same as comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not extend credit to, or engage in a covered transaction with, the parent company or a non-bank subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the bank&#8217;s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company or non-bank subsidiary exceeds 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or the aggregate amount of the bank&#8217;s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company and all non-bank subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be at least fully collateralized in accordance with specified collateralization thresholds, with the thresholds varying based on the type of assets serving as collateral. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations. 

At December 31, 2020, the balance outstanding at the Federal Reserve Bank was $ 84.9 billion. 

N OTE 21 L EGAL P ROCEEDINGS 

We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (&#8220;Disclosed Matters,&#8221; which are those matters disclosed in this Note 21). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of December 31, 2020, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount less than $ 100 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount. 

In our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. One or more of the following factors frequently contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, the possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; the possible outcomes may not be amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making assumptions about future decisions of courts or regulatory bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants). Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur. 

As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under &#8220;Other.&#8221; 

We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff&#8217;s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff&#8217;s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual. 

Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.

Interchange Litigation 

Beginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust lawsuits were filed against Visa&#174;, Mastercard&#174;, and several major financial institutions, including cases naming National City (since merged into The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged into National City Bank which in turn was merged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these cases are merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S., as well as trade associations. Some of these cases (including those naming National City entities) were brought as class actions on behalf of all persons or business entities that have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The cases have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master File No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JO). 

In July 2012, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding with the class plaintiffs and an agreement in principle with certain individual plaintiffs with respect to a settlement of these cases, under which the defendants agreed to pay approximately $ 6.6 billion collectively to the class and individual settling plaintiffs and agreed to changes in the terms applicable to their respective card networks (including an eight-month reduction in default credit interchange rates). The parties entered into a definitive agreement with respect to this settlement in October 2012. The court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2013. Several objectors appealed the order of approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order in June 2016, reversing approval of the settlement and remanding for further proceedings. In November 2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge the court of appeal&#8217;s decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition in March 2017. 

As a result of the reversal of the approval of the settlement, the class actions have resumed in the district court. In November 2016, the district court appointed separate interim class counsel for a proposed class seeking damages and a proposed class seeking equitable (injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of these counsel filed a proposed amended and supplemental complaint on behalf of its respective proposed class. These complaints make similar allegations, including that the defendants conspired to monopolize and to fix the prices for general purpose card network services, that the restructuring of Visa and Mastercard, each of which included an initial public offering, violated the antitrust laws, and that the defendants otherwise imposed unreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in the payment of inflated interchange fees and other fees, which also violated the antitrust laws. In their complaints, collectively the plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under the antitrust laws) and attorneys&#8217; fees. PNC is named as a defendant in the complaint seeking damages but is not named as a defendant in the complaint that seeks equitable relief. 

In September 2017, the magistrate judge at the district court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs&#8217; motions to file their proposed amended complaints. The dispute over amendment arose in part from the decision in United States v. American Express, Co., 838 F.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), in which the court held that the relevant market in a similar complaint against American Express is &#8220;two-sided,&#8221; i.e ., requires consideration of effects on consumers as well as merchants. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed (under the caption Ohio v. American Express Co. ) the court of appeals decision . Previously, the plaintiffs in this litigation had alleged a one-sided market, and, as a result of the court&#8217;s decision in American Express , they sought leave to add claims based on a two-sided market. The order allowed the complaint to be amended to include allegations pertaining to a two-sided market only to the extent those claims are not time-barred, but held that the two-sided market allegations do not relate back to the time of the original complaint and are not subject to tolling. In October 2017, the plaintiffs appealed this order to the presiding district court judge. In August 2018, the judge overruled this decision, finding that the two-sided market allegations do relate back. 

In September 2018, the relevant parties entered an amended definitive agreement to resolve the claims of the class seeking damages. In this amended settlement agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, to the following terms: 

&#160; 

&#8226; An additional settlement payment from all defendants of $ 900 million, with Visa&#8217;s share of the additional settlement payment being $ 600 million. The additional settlement payment will be added to the approximately $ 5.3 billion previously paid by the defendants pursuant to the original 2012 settlement agreement. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Up to $ 700 million may be returned to the defendants (with up to $ 467 million to Visa) if more than 15 % of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class. As more than 15 % of class members opted out of the class, $ 700 million has been returned to the defendants ($ 467 million to Visa). 

This amended settlement agreement is subject to court approval. Following preliminary approval in January 2019, and after class notice, the submission of opt-outs, and the filing of objections, the district court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2019. Several objectors have appealed the district court&#8217;s order granting final approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Some merchants that opted out from the settlement have brought lawsuits against Visa and Mastercard and one or more of the issuing banks. Resolution by Visa of claims by merchants that opted out of the settlement, including those that file lawsuits, have been or will be paid from the Visa litigation escrow account. 

176 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

National City and National City Bank entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks with respect to all of the above referenced litigation. We were not originally named as defendants in any of the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust litigation nor were we initially parties to the judgment or loss sharing agreements. However, we became responsible for National City&#8217;s and National City Bank&#8217;s position in the litigation and responsibilities under the agreements through our acquisition of National City. In addition, following Visa&#8217;s reorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its initial public offering, U.S. Visa members received shares of Class B Visa common stock, convertible upon resolution of specified litigation, including the remaining litigation described above, into shares of Class A Visa common stock, with the conversion rate adjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed to resolve the specified litigation, and also remained responsible for indemnifying Visa against the specified litigation. Our Class B Visa common stock is all subject to this conversion adjustment provision, and we are now responsible for the indemnification obligations of our predecessors as well as ourselves. We have also entered into a Mastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with Mastercard and other financial institution defendants and an Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation Sharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa, Mastercard and other financial institution defendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in substance, apportions resolution of the claims in this litigation into a Visa portion and a Mastercard portion, with the Visa portion being two-thirds and the Mastercard portion being one-third. This apportionment only applies in the case of either a global settlement involving all defendants or an adverse judgment against the defendants, to the extent that damages either are related to the merchants&#8217; inter-network conspiracy claims or are otherwise not attributed to specific Mastercard or Visa conduct or damages. The Mastercard portion (or any Mastercard-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will then be apportioned under the Mastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement among Mastercard and PNC and the other financial institution defendants that are parties to this agreement. The responsibility for the Visa portion (or any Visa-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under the pre-existing indemnification responsibilities and judgment and loss sharing agreements. 

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Indemnification Demands 

We have received indemnification demands from several entities sponsoring residential mortgage-backed securities and their affiliates where purchasers of the securities, trustees for the securitization trusts, or monoline insurers have asserted claims against the sponsors and other parties involved in the securitization transactions. National City Mortgage and its predecessors had sold to the sponsors or their affiliates whole loans that were allegedly included in certain of these securitization transactions. According to the indemnification demands, the claims for which indemnity is being sought are based on alleged misstatements and omissions in the offering documents for these transactions or breaches of representations and warranties relating to the loans made in connection with the transactions. The indemnification demands assert that agreements governing the sale of these loans or the securitization transactions to which National City Mortgage was a party require us to indemnify the sponsors and their affiliates for losses suffered in connection with these claims. 

The parties have settled several of these disputes. In February 2020, one of the entities asserting a right to indemnification submitted a demand for our purported share of the settlement amount of claims asserted against it and its affiliates. The portion of the settlement amount, if any, for which we are responsible in the settled cases has not been determined. 

Pre-need Funeral Arrangements 

National City Bank and PNC Bank are defendants in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under the caption Jo Ann Howard and Associates, P.C., et al. v. Cassity, et al. &#160;(No. 4:09-CV-1252-ERW) arising out of trustee services provided by Allegiant Bank, a National City Bank and PNC Bank predecessor, with respect to Missouri trusts that held pre-need funeral contract assets. Under a pre-need funeral contract, a customer pays an amount up front in exchange for payment of funeral expenses following the customer&#8217;s death. In a number of states, including Missouri, pre-need funeral contract sellers are required to deposit a portion of the proceeds of the sale of pre-need funeral contracts in a trust account. 

The lawsuit was filed in August 2009 by the Special Deputy Receiver for three insolvent affiliated companies, National Prearranged Services, Inc. a seller of pre-need funeral contracts (NPS), Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Company (Lincoln), and Memorial Service Life Insurance Company (Memorial). Seven individual state life and health insurance guaranty associations, who claim they are liable under state law for payment of certain benefits under life insurance policies sold by Lincoln and Memorial, and the National Organization of Life &#38; Health Guaranty Associations have also joined the action as plaintiffs. In addition to National City Bank and PNC Bank (added following filing of the lawsuit as successor-in-interest to National City Bank) (the PNC defendants), other defendants included members of the Cassity family, who controlled NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; officers and directors of NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; auditors and attorneys for NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; the trustees of each of the trusts that held pre-need funeral contract assets; and the investment advisor to the Pre-need Trusts. NPS retained several banks to act as trustees for the trusts holding NPS pre-need funeral contract assets (the NPS Trusts), with Allegiant Bank acting as one of these trustees with respect to seven Missouri NPS Trusts. All of the other defendants have settled with the plaintiffs, are otherwise no longer a party to the lawsuit, or are insolvent. 

In their Third Amended Complaint, filed in 2012 following the granting by the court in part of motions to dismiss made by the PNC defendants and the other NPS Trust trustees, the plaintiffs allege that Allegiant Bank breached its fiduciary duties and acted 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 177 

negligently as the trustee for the Missouri NPS Trusts. In part as a result of these breaches, the plaintiffs allege, members of the Cassity family, acting in concert with other defendants, were able to improperly remove millions of dollars from the NPS Trusts, which in turn caused NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial to become insolvent. The complaint alleges $ 600 million in present and future losses to the plaintiffs due to the insolvency of NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified actual and punitive damages, various equitable remedies including restitution, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs of suit and interest. 

In July 2013, five of the six defendants in a parallel federal criminal action, including two members of the Cassity family, entered into plea agreements with the U.S. to resolve criminal charges arising out of their conduct at NPS, Lincoln and Memorial. In August 2013, after a jury trial, the sixth defendant, the investment advisor to the NPS Trusts, was convicted on all criminal counts against him. The criminal charges against the defendants alleged, among other thing, a scheme to defraud Allegiant Bank and the other trustees of the NPS Trusts. 

In May 2014, the court granted the plaintiffs&#8217; motion to disallow the PNC defendants&#8217; affirmative defense relating to the plaintiffs&#8217; alleged failure to mitigate damages. In July 2014, the PNC defendants&#8217; motion for reconsideration was denied. In September 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint to reassert aiding and abetting claims, previously dismissed by the court in 2012. The court denied this motion in December 2014. Also in December 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the PNC defendants&#8217; motion for summary judgment. 

In March 2015, following a jury trial, the court entered a judgment against the PNC defendants in the amount of $ 356 million in compensatory damages and $ 36 million in punitive damages. In April 2015, the plaintiffs filed motions with the court seeking $ 179 million in pre-judgment interest. Also, in April 2015, the PNC defendants filed motions with the court to reduce the compensatory damages by the amounts paid in settlement by other defendants, to strike the punitive damages award, for judgment as a matter of law, and for a new trial. In November 2015, the court granted the motion to reduce the compensatory damages by amounts paid in settlement by other defendants and denied the other motions by the PNC defendants, with the judgment being reduced as a result to a total of $ 289 million, and also denied the plaintiffs&#8217; motion for pre-judgment interest. 

In December 2015, the PNC defendants appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Also in December 2015, the plaintiffs cross-appealed from the court&#8217;s orders reducing the judgment by amounts paid in settlement by other defendants, denying plaintiffs&#8217; motion for pre-judgment interest, and dismissing the plaintiffs&#8217; aiding and abetting claims. In August 2017, the court of appeals reversed the judgment to the extent that it was based on tort rather than trust law. The court accordingly held that any damages awarded to the plaintiff will be limited to losses to the trusts in Missouri caused by Allegiant&#8217;s breaches during the time it acted as trustee; plaintiffs cannot recover for damages to the Missouri trusts after Allegiant&#8217;s trusteeship or outside of the Missouri trusts, which had been included in the judgment under appeal. The court of appeals otherwise affirmed the judgment, including the dismissal of the aiding and abetting claims, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings in light of its decision. 

In September 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing by the panel solely seeking to remove the prohibition on damages being sought for the period following Allegiant&#8217;s trusteeship. In December 2017, the court denied the petition for rehearing. In July 2019, following a new trial on remand from the court of appeals, the district court awarded the plaintiffs $ 72 million in compensatory damages, $ 15 million in interest, and $ 15 million in punitive damages. The PNC defendants have appealed this judgment to the court of appeals, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. In December 2019, the court reduced the judgment by approximately $ 2.6 million to correct a mathematical error in calculating pre-judgment interest, reducing the total judgment to $ 99.5 million. In March 2020, the court dismissed the plaintiffs&#8217; cross-appeal on the plaintiffs&#8217; motion . In February 2020, the district court awarded $ 7 million in fees and costs to the plaintiffs, and the PNC defendants have appealed this judgment to the court of appeals. The consolidated appeals of the district court&#8217;s judgments were argued in January 2021. 

USAA Patent Infringement Litigation 

In September 2020, a lawsuit ( United Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A., Case No. 2:20-cv-319 ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against PNC Bank for patent infringement. The plaintiff amended its complaint in December 2020. As amended, the complaint alleges that PNC&#8217;s mobile remote deposit capture systems infringe on four patents owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys&#8217; fees. In December 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and in January 2021, we filed a motion to transfer the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Trial in this matter is presently scheduled to commence on March 7, 2022. 

In December 2020, we filed a lawsuit ( PNC Bank, N.A. v. United Services Automobile Association, Case No. 2:20-cv-1886 ) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against USAA seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement as to two of the patents at issue in the lawsuit pending in the Eastern District of Texas and awarding PNC its fees and costs.

Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries 

We are the subject of investigations, audits, examinations and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. From time to time, these inquiries have involved and may in the future involve or lead to regulatory enforcement actions and other administrative proceedings. These inquiries have also led to and may in the future lead to civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some of these inquiries result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. Such remedies and other consequences typically have not been material to us from a financial standpoint, but could be in the future. Even if not financially material, they may result in significant reputational harm or other adverse consequences. 

As has been publicly reported, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an inquiry relating to the federal LIHTC program directed at program participants. In connection with that inquiry, the Department of Justice requested information from PNC Bank, and we cooperated in that inquiry. 

Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including that described in this Note 21. 

Other 

In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.

We have three reportable business segments: 

&#8226; Retail Banking 

&#8226; Corporate &#38; Institutional Banking 

&#8226; Asset Management Group 

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period. 

During the second quarter of 2020, we divested our entire 22.4 % investment in BlackRock, which had previously been reported as a separate business segment. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity for additional information on the sale and details on our results and cash flows for 2020, 2019 and 2018. 

182 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. &#8211; 2020 Form 10-K 

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. These differences are reflected in the &#8220;Other&#8221; category in the Table 114. &#8220;Other&#8221; includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP). The &#8220;Other&#8221; category also includes our BlackRock held for sale asset. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparison. 

Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within &#8220;Other&#8221; for financial reporting purposes. 

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors. 

We have allocated ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments based on the loan exposures within each business segment&#8217;s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions.

N OTE 24 F EE-BASED R EVENUE FROM C ONTRACTS WITH C USTOMERS 

A subset of our noninterest income relates to certain fee-based revenue within the scope of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The objective of the standard is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers across all industries and to develop a common revenue standard under GAAP. The standard requires the application of a five-step recognition model to contracts, allocating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to across distinct promises in the contract, called performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when or as those services are transferred to the customer. 

Fee-based revenue within the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within our three reportable business segments, Retail Banking, Corporate &#38; Institutional Banking and Asset Management Group. Interest income, income from lease contracts, fair value gains from financial instruments (including derivatives), income from mortgage servicing rights and guarantee products, letter of credit fees, non-refundable fees associated with acquiring or originating a loan and gains from the sale of financial assets are outside of the scope of Topic 606. 

The following tables present noninterest income within the scope of Topic 606 disaggregated by segment. A description of the fee-based revenue and how it is recognized for each segment&#8217;s principal services and products follows each table.

(a) Nonaccrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in Noninterest income. 

(b) Loan fees for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $156 million, $163 million and $139 million, respectively. 

(c) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. See Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in this Statistical Information section for more information.

Our regulatory risk-based ratios for 2017 and 2016 were calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the Basel III rules (as such definitions and deductions were phased-in for 2017 and 2016). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for those periods and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets as the Transitional Basel III ratios.

Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) &#160;&#8211; A calculation of a loan&#8217;s collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value of that same collateral.

For example, a LTV of less than 90% is better secured and has less credit risk than a LTV of greater than or equal to 90%. 

Long run average &#8211; In the context of CECL, expected credit losses or credit risk parameters for the remaining estimated

Notional amount &#160;&#8211; The basis to which the underlying referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. 

Operating leverage &#160;&#8211; The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth ( i.e. , positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth ( i.e. , negative operating leverage). 

Options &#160;&#8211; Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future.

Reversion period &#8211; In the context of CECL, the period between the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and the point 

at which losses are expected to have reverted to their long run average, in order to reflect an overall reasonable estimate of expected 

credit losses.

Risk limits &#160;&#8211; Quantitative measures based on forward-looking assumptions that allocate our aggregate risk appetite ( e.g., measure of loss or negative events) to business lines, legal entities, specific risk categories, concentrations and as appropriate, other levels. 

Risk profile &#160;&#8211; The risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of risk. The profile represents overall risk position in relation to the desired risk appetite.

Supplementary leverage ratio &#8211; Basel III Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure. 

Taxable-equivalent interest income &#160;&#8211; The interest income earned on certain assets that is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. These tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. 

Troubled debt restructuring (TDR) &#160;&#8211; A loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

Yield curve &#160;&#8211; A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a &#8220;normal&#8221; or &#8220;positive&#8221; yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A &#8220;flat&#8221; yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A &#8220;steep&#8221; yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An &#8220;inverted&#8221; or &#8220;negative&#8221; yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.
