EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

In June 2021, Huntington closed the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation. Historical periods prior to June 9, 2021 reflect results of legacy Huntington operations. Subsequent to closing, results reflect all post-acquisition activity. See Note 3 &#8220;Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation&#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

In May 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Torana, now known as Huntington Choice Pay, a digital payments business focused on business to consumer payments. This acquisition along with the formation of our enterprise-wide payments group reflects one of our strategic priorities to accelerate our payments capabilities and expand the services provided to our customers. 

In June 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, a top tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm. The transaction brings a national scale to serve middle market business owners throughout the corporate lifecycle, building on Huntington&#8217;s regional banking foundation. Capstone Partners related revenue, including mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and other advisory-related fees, is recognized within capital markets fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Summary of 2022 Second Quarter Results Compared to 2021 Second Quarter 

For the quarter, we reported net income of $539 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, compared with a net loss of $15 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter. The 2022 second quarter reported net income benefited from the full-quarter impact of the TCF acquisition and organic growth, while the year-ago quarter was negatively impacted by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $294 million, or $239 million after tax ($0.21 per diluted common share) in addition to acquisition-related expenses totaling $269 million, or $218 million after-tax ($0.19 per diluted common share). 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 5 

Net interest income was $1.3 billion, up $423 million, or 50% from the year-ago quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased $423 million, or 50%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit from a $33.8 billion, or 27%, increase in average earning assets and a 49 basis point increase in the FTE NIM to 3.15%. Average earning assets growth included a $26.6 billion, or 30%, increase in average loans and leases and a $11.8 billion, or 38%, increase in average securities. The year-over-year increase in NIM was primarily due to improvements in yields on earning assets largely driven by the Federal Reserve's rate increases in addition to the 2021 second quarter unfavorable impact from the $55 million mark-to-market of interest rate caps. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $144 million from the year-ago quarter to $67 million in the 2022 second quarter. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily due to the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $294 million recognized in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by loan and lease growth. T he ACL decreased $154 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.2 billion in the 2022 second quarter to 1.87% of total loans and leases, compared to $2.3 billion, or 2.09% of total lo ans and leases. The decrease in ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was driven by overall improved credit quality over the last year while recognizing the near-term recessionary risks. NCOs decreased $54 million from the year-ago-quarter to $8 million. Total NCOs represented an annualized 0.03% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, down from 0.28% in the year-ago quarter. 

Noninterest income was $485 million, an increase of $41 million, or 9%, and noninterest expense decreased $54 million, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase to noninterest income was primarily due to the full-quarter benefit from the TCF acquisition, completed in June 2021. The decrease to noninterest expense was primarily due to a reduction in acquisition-related expenses of $245 million and execution of cost reduction initiatives , partially offset by the full-quarter impact from the TCF acquisition. 

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 5.80% at June 30, 2022 , down 108 bas is points from December 31, 2021 , primarily d ue to a decrease in tangible common equity related to higher interest rates causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income and the impact from the acquisitions of Capstone Partners and Torana, partially offset by earnings . CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.05%, down fr om 9.33% from December 31, 2021 . The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.63% compared to 10.99% at December 31, 2021. The decrease in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by risk-weighted assets growth and goodwill recognized, partially offset by earnings. 

During the first six months of 2022, Huntington repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization which began the third quarter of 2021 and expired June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, the end of the current repurchase authorization, Huntington completed $650 million of the share repurchase authorization.

COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption that has affected daily living and has negatively impacted the economy. As further discussed in &#8220;Discussion of Results of Operations,&#8221; the volatility in the markets and economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic continue to have impact. 

6 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Huntington reacted quickly to the changes required by the pandemic as a result of the commitment and flexibility of our colleagues coupled with well-prepared business continuity plans. We continue to make progress welcoming more of our colleagues back to the office as part of our Coming Back Together plan. We offer Workplace Flex to help employees achieve work/life harmony in support of the business. We achieve this with flexible work arrangements, parental leave, and other health, wellness and financial benefits and services that assist employees and their families. We continue to monitor the impact of the virus and current government guidelines. 

Economy 

Growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages, supply chain complications and geopolitical matters, have contributed to rising inflation. In response, the FRB has raised interest rates and began reducing the size of its balance sheet. Furthermore, the FRB signaled that it would continue to implement these policy actions in order to bring inflation down. The timing and impact of inflation and rising interest rates on our business and related financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Our businesses and financial results may be impacted by a variety of other factors as well, such as an economic slowdown or recession. 

We delivered positive results this quarter, driven by continued execution of strategic initiatives in addition to loan and lease and revenue growth. Further, we added capabilities through the acquisitions of Capstone Partners and Torana during the quarter. Additionally, we saw net interest income expansion, average deposit growth and demonstrated disciplined expense management. Credit continues to perform well in keeping with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile through-the-cycle. Through our disciplined and proactive approach, we believe Huntington is well positioned to manage through the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. We remain focused on delivering profitable growth.

2022 Second Quarter versus 2021 Second Quarter 

Net interest income for the 2022 second quarter increased $423 million, or 50%, from the 2021 second quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the 2022 second quarter increased $423 million, or 50%, from the 2021 second quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflects the benefit of a $33.8 billion, or 27%, increase in average total earning assets and a 49 basis point increase in the FTE NIM to 3.15%. The increase in average total earning assets included a $26.6 billion, or 30%, increase in average loans and leases and a $11.8 billion, or 38%, increase in average securities . Average balances across earning asset categories for the 2022 second quarter reflect the full-quarter impact of the TCF acquisition in addition to organic growth. The increase in average securities was additionally driven by the redeployment of excess liquidity into securities in the second half of 2021. 

The NIM expansion was primarily due to improvements in yields on earning assets driven by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rate increases in addition to the 2021 second quarter unfavorable impact from the $55 million mark-to-market of interest rate caps. 

Net interest income for the 2022 second quarter included $16 million of net interest income from purchase accounting accretion and $5 million in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA, compared to $9 million and $30 million, respectively, in the 2021 second quarter.

2022 First Six Months versus 2021 First Six Months 

Net interest income for the first six-month period of 2022 increased $597 million, or 33%, from the year-ago period. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first six-month period of 2022 increased $599 million, or 33%, from the year-ago period. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit of a $41.0 billion, or 34%, increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 2 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 3.02%. The increase in average total earning assets included a $28.7 billion, or 34%, increase in average loans and leases and a $14.1 billion, or 50%, increase in average securities. Average balances across earning assets categories reflect the late second-quarter 2021 TCF acquisition in addition to organic growth. The increase in average securities was additionally driven by the redeployment of excess liquidity into securities in the second half of 2021. 

The NIM compression was driven by the benefit from the $89 million net mark-to-market impact of interest rate caps in the prior year and the impact of lower accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA in 2022, partially offset by improvements in yields on securities and the benefit from an increase in net interest income from purchase accounting accretion in 2022. 

Net interest income for the first six-month period of 2022 included $35 million of net interest income from purchase accounting accretion and $16 million in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA, compared to $9 million and $75 million, respectively, in the year-ago period. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Credit Risk &#8221; section.) 

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the credit allowance at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio, securities portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. 

The provision for credit losses for the 2022 second quarter was $67 million, a decrease of $144 million, compared to the 2021 second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, provision for credit losses for the first six-month period of 2022 was $92 million, a decrease of $59 million, or 39%, compared to the year-ago period. The decrease in provision expense over the prior year quarter and the prior year-to-date period was primarily attributed to the second quarter 2021 TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $294 million ($234 million from loans and leases and $60 million from acquired unfunded lending commitments), partially offset by loan and lease growth. The components of the provision for credit losses were as follows: 

Table 5 - Provision for Credit Losses Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Provision for loan and lease losses $ 64 $ 145 $ 71 $ 98 Provision for unfunded lending commitments 3 66 17 53 Provision for securities &#8212; &#8212; 4 &#8212; Total provision for credit losses $ 67 $ 211 $ 92 $ 151 

The ACL decreased $154 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.2 billion, or 1.87%, of total loans and leases, compared to $2.3 billion, or 2.09% of total loans and leases. The decrease in ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was driven by overall improved credit quality over the last year while recognizing the near-term recessionary risks.

2022 Second Quarter versus 2021 Second Quarter 

Noninterest income for the 2022 second quarter was $485 million, an increase of $41 million, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase in noninterest income for the 2022 second quarter was driven by the full-quarter impact from the TCF acquisition, completed in June 2021. Capital markets fees increased $19 million, or 54%, primarily reflecting higher interest rate derivative fees, underwriting and advisory fees, foreign exchange fees and loan syndication. Gain on sale of loans increased $9 million, primarily due to resuming the sale of SBA loans in 2022. Trust and investment management services increased $7 million, or 13%, reflecting continued strong sales and the TCF acquisition. All other increases were primarily a result of the impact of the TCF acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases, mortgage banking income decreased $23 million, or 34%, primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume. Net gains on sales of securities decreased $10 million as the 2021 second quarter included sales reflecting securities optimization following the acquisition of TCF.

Noninterest income for the first six-month period of 2022 increased $145 million, or 17%, from the year-ago period. The first six-month period of 2022 noninterest income across categories was driven by the full-period impact of the TCF acquisition, completed in June 2021. Gain on sale of loans increased $34 million, reflecting higher SBA loan sales resulting from the strategic decision to retain SBA loans on the balance sheet during 2021. Capital markets fees increased $32 million, or 50%, primarily reflecting higher interest rate derivative fees, foreign exchange fees, loan syndication fees and underwriting and advisory fees. Trust and investment management services increased $20 million, or 19%, primarily reflecting continued strong sales and the TCF acquisition. All other increases were primarily result of the impact of the TCF acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking of $74 million, or 44%, primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume, and a decrease in net gains on sales of securities of $10 million, as the prior year included sales reflecting securities optimization following the acquisition of TCF.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes in the 2022 second quarter was $120 million, compared to $14 million in the 2021 second quarter. The provision for income taxes for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 was $225 million and $116 million, respectively. All periods included the benefits from general business credits, capital losses, tax-exempt income, tax-exempt bank owned life insurance income, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. The effective tax rates for the 2022 second quarter and 2021 second quarter were 18.1% and (2,353.3)%, respectively. Excluding TCF acquisition-related expense of $269 million, the related tax benefit of $51 million and discrete tax expenses of $16 million, the 2021 second quarter effective tax rate would have been 18.8%. The effective tax rates for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 were 18.3% and 18.5%, respectively. 

The net federal deferred tax asset was $401 million and the net state deferred tax asset was $49 million at June 30, 2022.

We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009. The 2010 and 2011 tax years remain under exam by the IRS. While the statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2012 through 2020, the IRS has advised that tax years 2012 through 2014 will not be audited and is currently examining the 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. Also, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2017. 

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL 

We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with our Board of Directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle. Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access management, and authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. 

We believe that our primary risk exposures are credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance. More information on risk can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors below, the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The MD&#38;A included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with this MD&#38;A as this discussion provides only material updates to the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&#38;A should also be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , and other information contained in this report. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios (see Note 4 &#8220; Investment Securities and Other Securities &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. 

We focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our ongoing expansion of portfolio management resources is central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.

Our loan portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation.

Credit Quality 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 &#8220; Loans / Leases &#8221; and Note 6 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance. 

Credit quality performance in the 2022 second quarter reflected NCOs of $8 million, or 0.03% of average total loans and leases, annualized, a decrease of $54 million, compared to $62 million, or 0.28%, in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by a $70 million reduction in Commercial NCOs resulting in net recoveries of $11 million in 2022 second quarter, partially offset by a $16 million increase in Consumer NCOs. NPAs decreased from December 31, 2021 by $68 million, or 9%, largely driven by decreases in commercial and industrial and lease financing NALs.

NPAs and NALs 

Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $463 million of commercial related NALs at June 30, 2022, $300 million, or 65%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. 

The following table reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail.

ACL 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Our ACL is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. 

We use statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on three key parameters: PD, EAD, and LGD. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period (two to three years), the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario. 

20 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the appropriate committee governance channels described below. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and GDP. The probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period and determined through our ACL process. Any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management. Additionally, we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios. Lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics, risk ratings, origination credit bureau scores, delinquency status, and remaining months within loan agreements, among other factors. 

The baseline scenario used for the 2022 second quarter assumes that the Russian invasion will not spread beyond Ukraine and the resulting disruptions to the oil, natural gas and other commodity markets will be limited and temporary. The overnight federal funds rate is forecast to average 2.1% in fourth quarter 2022 as the Federal Reserve looks to address the rising inflation. This rate is expected to peak at 2.75% prior to the expectation that the fed would start to cut rates in late 2024. 

The table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment rate and GDP has changed since the end of 2021: 

Table 13 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables Baseline scenario forecast 2021 2022 2023 Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Unemployment rate (1) 4Q 2021 4.5 % 3.7 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 1Q 2022 N/A 3.7 3.4 3.4 3.4 2Q 2022 N/A 3.5 3.3 3.4 3.5 Gross Domestic Product (1) 4Q 2021 6.6 % 3.6 % 2.5 % 2.9 % 2.8 % 1Q 2022 N/A 6.1 2.5 2.9 2.9 2Q 2022 N/A 3.6 2.7 2.3 2.6 (1) Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts. 

Management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including those related to geopolitical instability, and current inflation levels considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to address such uncertainty. While we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our ACL, the ultimate impact the current inflation levels and attempts to lower inflation through Federal Reserve rate actions will have on the economy remains uncertain. 

Management develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our governance committees reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transactional reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the June 30, 2022 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles related to the potential economic impact of a near-term recession as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates attempting to lower inflation, and the commercial real estate portfolio, to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

Our ACL methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date. The loss modeling process uses an EAD concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments, where appropriate. Losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as AULC within other liabilities in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. A liability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized if Huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable. 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 21 

The AULC is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. (See Note 1 &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.) 

Our ACL evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to current performance. For more information, including the ALLL and AULC activity by portfolio segment, refer to Note 6 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan categories and the reported ACL: 

Table 14 - Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses (1) (dollar amounts in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 ALLL Commercial Commercial and industrial $ 804 38 % $ 832 37 % Commercial real estate 498 13 586 14 Lease financing 40 4 44 4 Total commercial 1,342 55 1,462 55 Consumer Residential mortgage 177 18 145 17 Automobile 146 12 108 12 Home equity 131 9 88 9 RV and marine 147 5 105 5 Other consumer 131 1 122 2 Total consumer 732 45 568 45 Total ALLL 2,074 100 % 2,030 100 % AULC 94 77 Total ACL $ 2,168 $ 2,107 Total ALLL as a % of Total loans and leases 1.78% 1.82% Nonaccrual loans and leases 316 284 NPAs 304 271 Total ACL as % of Total loans and leases 1.87% 1.89% Nonaccrual loans and leases 330 294 NPAs 318 281 

(1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases. 

At June 30, 2022, the ACL was $2.2 billion, or 1.87% of total loans and leases, compared to $2.1 billion, or 1.89%, at December 31, 2021. The decrease in ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases reflects overall improved credit quality while recognizing the near-term recessionary risks , while the increase in the total ACL was driven by loan and lease growth.

Market Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going market risk management processes.) 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. 

24 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

We measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition, and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business. 

In measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet, we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts, and &#8220;ramp&#8221; scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, we presume that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon. 

We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net interest income at risk (NII at risk) and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis (EVE at Risk). 

Table 17 - Net Interest Income at Risk &#160; Net Interest Income at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -25 +100 +200 June 30, 2022 -2.1 3.0 6.0 December 31, 2021 -2.4 4.6 8.9 

The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual &#8220;ramp&#8221; +100 and +200 basis point parallel shift scenarios, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months, as well as an immediate parallel &#8220;shock&#8221; scenario of -25 basis points. 

The NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The change in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in market interest rate expectations, and the size and mix of the balance sheet. 

Table 18 - Economic Value of Equity at Risk &#160; Economic Value of Equity at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -25 +100 +200 June 30, 2022 0.9 -5.1 -11.6 December 31, 2021 -0.1 -1.5 -5.6 

The EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios. 

As of June 30, 2022, EVE at risk sensitivities have increased since December 31, 2021. The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by changes in the spot market rate curve extending the duration of the securities portfolio and shortening the duration of liabilities. 

We have LIBOR-based exposure in the form of variable rate loans, derivatives, Series B preferred stock, long term debt and other securities and financial arrangements. To address the discontinuance of LIBOR in its current form, we established a LIBOR transition team and project plan under the oversight of the CRO and CFO, providing periodic updates to the ROC. As of December 31, 2021, Huntington ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans. Contract remediation efforts coordinated by the LIBOR transition team are scheduled for completion by June 2023. Source systems have been updated to support alternative reference rates. At this time alternative reference rates are predominantly SOFR based. As such, we have developed a SOFR-enabled interest rate risk monitoring framework and a strategy for managing interest rate risk during the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. We continue to monitor market developments and legislative and regulatory updates. 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 25 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, collars, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps. 

Table 19 shows all swap, collar and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 &#8220; Derivative Financial Instruments &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

MSRs 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 7 &#8220; Mortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights &#8221; of Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .) 

At June 30, 2022, we had a total of $463 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $31.7 billion in mortgage loans. 

MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. 

MSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Price Risk 

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held.

Liquidity Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going liquidity risk management processes.) 

Our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base. Core deposits comprised approximately 97% of total deposits at June 30, 2022. We also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity, including advances from the FHLB, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. Liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $12.9 billion as of June 30, 2022. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are consumer and commercial core deposits. At June 30, 2022, these core deposits funded 79% of total assets (122% of total loans). Other sources of liquidity include non-core deposits, FHLB advances, wholesale debt instruments, and securitizations. Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $27 million and $29 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The following table reflects deposit composition detail.

(1) Includes consumer certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more. 

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. Total loans and securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and the FHLB are $91.3 billion at June 30, 2022. 

At June 30, 2022, the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, and security repurchase agreements, and to support borrowing capacity totaled $28.7 billion. There were no securities of a single issuer, which are not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at June 30, 2022. 

To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding, asset securitization or sale. Sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, negotiable CDs, brokered and other deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. Our wholesale funding for both the Bank and parent company totaled $14.8 billion at June 30, 2022, compared to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase from year-end is primarily due to issuances of short-term FHLB advances and senior debt, partially offset by repayment of maturing debt instruments. 

At June 30, 2022, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

28 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company&#8217;s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. 

The parent company had $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 

On July 20, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.155 per common share. The dividend is payable on October 3, 2022, to shareholders of record on September 19, 2022. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.155 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $224 million per quarter. Additionally, on July 20, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G and Series H Preferred Stock dividend payable on October 17, 2022 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2022. On June 17, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I Preferred Stock payable on September 1, 2022 to shareholders of record on August 15, 2022. Total cash demands required for Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I are expected to be approximately $28 million per quarter. 

During the first six months of 2022, the Bank paid preferred and common dividends to the parent company of $22 million and $458 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities. 

At June 30, 2022, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, caps and floors, collars, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. 

We actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats have increased, primarily through phishing campaigns. We are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns. We have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely. 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 29 

Our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our board-level Technology Committee, as appropriate. As a complement to the overall cyber security risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. 

To govern operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and our Audit Committee, as appropriate. Significant findings or issues are escalated by the Third Party Risk Management Committee to the Technology Committee of the Board, as appropriate. 

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk-monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance. 

Compliance Risk 

Financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. 

Capital 

We consider disciplined capital management as a key objective. Both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing our overall capital adequacy. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are adequate.

The following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and Bank levels for each of the periods presented:

(1) Huntington elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period which began January 1, 2022 pursuant to a rule that allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. As of June 30, 2022, we have phased in 25% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remainder of the three-year transition period. 

At June 30, 2022, we maintained Basel III capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the FRB. Th e decrease i n regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by risk-weighted asset growth and goodwill recognized during the quarter, partially offset by earnings. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

We generate shareholders&#8217; equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders&#8217; equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $18.0 billion at June 30, 2022, a decrease of $1.3 billion or 7% when compared with December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest rates causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by earnings, net of dividends. 

Huntington is authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the FRB&#8217;s capital rule, inclusive of the SCB requirement. As of June 30, 2022, Huntington&#8217;s SCB requirement was 2.5%, which is the minimum under the SCB framework. On April 5, 2022, Huntington submitted its 2022 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review. By notice dated June 23, 2022, the Federal Reserve informed Huntington that its indicative SCB requirement associated with its 2022 Capital Plan is 3.3%. Huntington has submitted a request to the Federal Reserve for reconsideration of the indicative SCB requirement. Huntington anticipates that the Federal Reserve will disclose Huntington&#8217;s final SCB requirement by August 31, 2022, which will become effective October 1, 2022. 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 31 

Share Repurchases 

From time to time our Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board of Directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. 

During the first six months of 2022, Huntington repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization which began the third quarter of 2021 and ended June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, the end of the current repurchase authorization, Huntington completed $650 million of the original $800 million share repurchase authorization. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION 

Overview 

Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. We have four major business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. 

Business segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. 

Revenue Sharing 

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. 

Expense Allocation 

The management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) 

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities).

2022 First Six Months versus 2021 First Six Months 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $560 million in the six-month period of 2022, compared to $167 million in the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $387 million, or 85%, primarily due to an increase in average earning assets reflecting the impact of the June 2021 acquisition of TCF and higher utilization rates, and a 30 basis point increase in net interest margin driven by an increase in spreads largely due to impact from the Federal Reserve's recent rate increases. The provision for credit losses decreased $218 million, primarily due to the initial provision for credit losses recognized in the second quarter 2021 related to the TCF acquisition. Noninterest income increased $89 million, or 44%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition in addition to an increase in capital markets fees, primarily reflecting higher interest rate derivative fees, foreign exchange fees, loan syndication fees and underwriting and advisory fees. Noninterest expense increased $190 million, or 62%, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, driven by higher personnel expense due to increased number of colleagues, allocated overhead and operating lease expense.

Consumer and Business Banking, including Home Lending, reported net income of $205 million in the six-month period of 2022, an increase of $100 million, or 95%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $290 million, or 41%, primarily due to an increase in average earnings assets reflecting the impact of the June 2021 acquisition of TCF and a 3 basis point increase in net interest margin driven primarily from impact of the Federal Reserve's recent rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA. The provision for credit losses increased $11 million to $74 million, primarily due to an increase in loan growth. Noninterest income increased $65 million, or 14%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, primarily due to higher interchange income and service charges on deposit accounts along with gains from SBA sales in 2022, partially offset by decreased mortgage banking income primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume. Noninterest expense increased $218 million, or 22%, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition largely driven by higher personnel expense reflecting an increase in the number of FTE employees and allocated overhead. 

Home Lending, an operating unit of Consumer and Business Banking, reflects the result of the origination, sale, and servicing of mortgage loans less referral fees and net interest income for mortgage banking products distributed by the retail branch network and other business segments. Home Lending reported net income of $80 million in the six-month period of 2022, compared with net income of $23 million in the year-ago period. Net interest income increased $94 million, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition, reduction in prepayment activity and increased retention. The provision for credit losses decreased $32 million, primarily due to continued general improvement in economic conditions. Noninterest income decreased $52 million, driven primarily by lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume.

Vehicle Finance reported net income of $62 million in the six-month period of 2022, a decrease of $99 million, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $20 million, or 9%, primarily due to an increase in average earning assets and a 2 basis point increase in the net interest margin. The provision for credit losses increased $132 million, primarily due to reserve releases in 2021 as the economic environment was improving, in addition to the increasing risk during the second quarter 2022 of a near-term recession as the Federal Reserve raises rates attempting to lower inflation. Noninterest income was relatively unchanged from the year-ago period. Noninterest expense increased $14 million, or 19%, largely attributable to higher production related costs and geographic expansion.

2022 First Six Months versus 2021 First Six Months 

RBHPCG reported net income of $41 million for the first six-month period of 2022, an increase of $4 million, or 11%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $34 million, or 49%, primarily due to an increase in average earnings assets and a 24 basis point increase in net interest margin, largely driven by higher benefit in deposit spreads. Average loans and leases increased $1.8 billion, or 27%, due to growth in both commercial and residential real estate mortgages, and the impact of the June 2021 acquisition of TCF. Average deposits increased $2.2 billion, or 30%, primarily related to higher customer liquidity levels, and impact of the acquired TCF deposit portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased $16 million, largely due to loan growth. Noninterest income increased $17 million, or 16%, reflecting higher sales production and the impact of the TCF acquisition. Total assets under management decreased 13% due to equity and bond markets, offset by positive net asset flows. Noninterest expense increased $30 million primarily due to an increase in personnel expense impacted by the TCF acquisition. 

Treasury / Other 

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives (including the mark-to-market of interest rate caps in the first six-month period of 2021), and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. 

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity as well as the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, acquisition-related expenses, if any, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This report, including MD&#38;A, contains certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are not historical facts and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations. The forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants and mutations and their impact on the global economy and financial market conditions and our business, results of operations, and financial condition; uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; movements in interest rates; reform of LIBOR; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services including those implementing our &#8220;Fair Play&#8221; banking philosophy; the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and CFPB; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction with TCF are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Huntington does business; and other factors that may affect the future results of Huntington. 

All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. Huntington does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. 

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis 

Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent. We encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; Tangible equity to tangible assets, and 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel III definitions. 

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 37 

Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company&#8217;s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A . 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL at June 30, 2022 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate. 

However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around the Russian invasion of Ukraine worsening and lasting longer than the baseline scenario. Import bans on Russian oil lead to additional price increases, contributing to higher inflation rates that are also exacerbated by the continuing supply chain disruption. Additionally, the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates through the first half of 2023 to fight inflation even as the economy heads into a recession in the third quarter 2022. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period, the rate is estimated at 6.4% and 7.7% at the end of 2022 and 2023 respectively. These numbers result in unemployment rates that are approximately 3.1% and 4.2% higher than baseline scenario projections of 3.3% and 3.5%, respectively for the same time periods. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at June 30, 2022, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and this 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $900 million at June 30, 2022. This hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models.

The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The highly uncertain economic environment; 

&#8226; The difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework. 

We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation including a near-term recession, or the emergence of a more contagious and severe COVID-19 variant, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time.

Fair Value Measurement 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including securities, and derivative instruments. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions, adjustments and judgment including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, cash flows, default rates, loss rates, terminal values and liquidation values. A significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value, which in turn, may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. 

The fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available. Our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2 in fair value hierarchy), when available. The level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value. The fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy, additional discussion regarding fair value measurements, and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs, can be found in Note 13 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. This typically results in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life, which is also subjective. Customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets, including but not limited to, customer deposit intangibles.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Huntington reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position, the results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include descriptions of significant accounting policies, as updated by the information contained in this report, should be read in conjunction with these interim financial statements. 

For statement of cash flow purposes, cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits at Federal Reserve Bank. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year&#8217;s presentation. 

Effective in the 2022 first quarter, a new classification within the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of accrued income and other receivables was established comprised of activity that was previously classified as loans and leases (other consumer loans and leases) and other assets. All prior period amounts and all related metrics have been revised to conform to the current presentation. 

In conjunction with applicable accounting standards, all material subsequent events have been either recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosed in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material subsequent events to disclose for the current period. 

2. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 

Accounting standards adopted in the current period 

Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial Statements ASU 2021-08-Business Combinations (Topic 805) Issued October 2021 &#8226; The amendments in this update require that an acquirer apply topic 606 to the recognition and measurement of revenue contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. 

&#8226; Management adopted the guidance during the second quarter 2022. 

&#8226; The ASU has been applied to all business combinations occurring during the first six months of 2022 and will be applied prospectively to all business combinations occurring after adoption. 

&#8226; The adoption did not result in a material impact on Huntington&#8217;s Consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2022-01-Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method Issued March 2022 &#8226; The amendments in this update expand the current last-of-layer method to allow for multiple hedge layers in a single closed portfolio. To reflect the expansion, the last-of-layer method has been renamed the portfolio layer method. The standard also expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to nonprepayable financial assets. 

&#8226; Management early adopted the guidance during the second quarter of 2022 using the modified retrospective basis. There was no impact to Huntington&#8217;s Consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption. Amendments related to disclosures were applied prospectively from the initial adoption date. 

&#8226; The ASU also gives entities the option to reclassify debt securities classified in the held-to-maturity category at the date of adoption to the available-for-sale category if the entity applies the portfolio layer method hedging to one or more closed portfolios that include those debt securities, Huntington did not apply this option to any held-to-maturity securities.

Accounting standards yet to be adopted 

Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements ASU 2022-02- Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures Issued March 2022 &#8226; The amendments in this update eliminate TDR accounting for entities that have adopted Update 2016-13, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The ASU also requires current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. 

&#8226; Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

&#8226; Adoption of the ASU will be applied prospectively, except for the portion of the standard related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs an entity may elect to use a modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption. An entity that elects to early adopt in an interim period should apply the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. An entity may also chose to early adopt the amendments about TDRs and related disclosure enhancements separately from amendments about vintage disclosures. 

&#8226; Huntington is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its Consolidated financial statements, as well as which adoption method to apply. 

3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

On June 15, 2022, Huntington acquired Capstone Partners, a leading middle market investment bank and advisory firm dedicated to servicing middle market companies throughout their full business lifecycle. The acquisition resulted in $ 192 million of goodwill, allocated to the Commercial segment, which approximates total consideration. Fair value estimates related to the acquired assets and liabilities are subject to adjustment during the one-year measurement period following the closing of the acquisition. The goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes.

Based on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability of cash flows, as of June 30, 2022, Huntington has concluded that except for one municipal bond classified as an AFS debt security for which a charge-off of $ 4 million was recognized during the 2022 first quarter, it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio. There was no allowance related to investment securities as of June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

Lease Financing 

Huntington leases equipment to customers, and substantially all such arrangements are classified as either sales-type or direct financing leases, which are included in commercial loans and leases. These leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income, and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases. 

Huntington assesses net investments in leases (including residual values) for impairment and recognizes any impairment losses in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investments in leases may be reduced by an ACL, with changes recognized as provision expense. 

The following table presents net investments in lease financing receivables by category at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit Quality Indicators 

See Note 5 &#8220;Loans/Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the credit quality indicators Huntington utilizes for monitoring credit quality and for determining an appropriate ACL level. 

To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality for commercial loans, and for purposes of determining an appropriate ACL level for these loans, Huntington utilizes the following internally defined categories of credit grades: 

&#8226; Pass - Higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 

&#8226; OLEM - The credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect Huntington&#8217;s position in the future. For these reasons, Huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Substandard - Inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, equity, and/or the collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. It is likely Huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated. 

&#8226; Doubtful - Loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high. 

Loans are generally assigned a category of &#8220; Pass &#8221; rating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrower&#8217;s financial performance. 

Commercial loans categorized as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are considered Criticized loans. Commercial loans categorized as Substandard or Doubtful are both considered Classified loans. 

For all classes within the consumer loan portfolios, loans are assigned pool level PD factors based on the FICO range within which the borrower&#8217;s credit bureau score falls. A credit bureau score is a credit score developed by FICO based on data provided by the credit bureaus. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher the credit bureau score, the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore, an indicator of higher credit quality. 

Huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics. The classifications described above, and also presented in the table below, represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes.

TDR Loans 

TDRs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered TDRs when the concessions provided would not otherwise be considered. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. See Note 5 &#8220;Loans / Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of TDRs. 

The following table presents, by class and modification type, the number of contracts, post-modification outstanding balance, and the financial effects of the modification for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

(1) Loan and lease charge-offs for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 exclude $ 80 million of charge-offs recognized upon completion of the TCF acquisition related to required purchase accounting treatment. The initial ALLL recognized on PCD assets included these amounts and after charging these amounts off upon acquisition, the net impact was $ 432 million of additional ALLL for PCD loans. 

(2) Includes $ 234 million of TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses related to non-PCD loans and leases. 

(3) Includes $ 60 million from acquired unfunded lending commitments. 

At June 30, 2022, the ACL was $ 2.2 billion, an increase of $ 61 million from the December 31, 2021 balance of $ 2.1 billion. 

The economic scenarios used in the June 30, 2022 ACL determination contained judgmental assumptions due to elevated levels of economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical instability, high inflation readings, and the expected path of interest rate increases by the Fed. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the June 30, 2022 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including the potential economic impact of a near-term recession as the Fed raises interest rates attempting to lower inflation, and the commercial real estate portfolio, to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve.

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Fair value, beginning of period $ 416 &#160; $ 274 &#160; $ 351 &#160; $ 210 &#160; Servicing assets obtained in acquisition &#8212; &#160; `` 59 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 59 &#160; New servicing assets created 18 &#160; 38 &#160; 47 &#160; 72 &#160; Change in fair value during the period due to: Time decay (1) ( 5 ) ( 4 ) ( 10 ) ( 7 ) Payoffs (2) ( 10 ) ( 16 ) ( 20 ) ( 33 ) Changes in valuation inputs or assumptions (3) 44 &#160; ( 24 ) 95 &#160; 26 &#160; Fair value, end of period $ 463 &#160; $ 327 &#160; $ 463 &#160; $ 327 &#160; Weighted-average life (years) 8.1 6.9 8.1 6.9 

(1) Represents decrease in value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled principal payments and partial loan paydowns. 

(2) Represents decrease in value associated with loans that paid off during the period. 

(3) Represents change in value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates. 

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Therefore, the fair value of MSRs is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of MSRs. MSR values are sensitive to movement in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which are impacted by the level of prepayments. 

A summary of key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR value to changes in these assumptions at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021 follows: 

June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Decline in fair value due to Decline in fair value due to (dollar amounts in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change

Share Repurchases 

On July 21, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $ 800 million of common shares which began in the third quarter of 2021 and ended as of June 30, 2022. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may have included open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the first six months of 2022, Huntington repurchased no shares of common stock. As of June 30, 2022, Huntington completed $ 650 million of the share repurchase authorization. 

Treasury shares 

Treasury shares includes shares held for deferred compensation plans, at cost, of $ 85 million at June 30, 2022 and $ 79 million at December 31, 2021. 

Non-controlling Interest in Subsidiaries 

Through the acquisition of TCF, Huntington acquired a joint venture in which Huntington maintains a 55 % ownership interest. As Huntington has a controlling financial interest, its financial results are consolidated in Huntington's financial statements and the other party&#8217;s 45 % ownership interest is reported as a non-controlling interest within equity.

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock) available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units and awards, and distributions from deferred compensation plans. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. 

The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data, share count in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Basic earnings per common share: Net income attributable to Huntington Bancshares Inc $ 539 &#160; $ ( 15 ) $ 999 &#160; $ 517 &#160; Preferred stock dividends 28 &#160; 43 &#160; 56 &#160; 74 &#160; Net income available to common shareholders $ 511 &#160; $ ( 58 ) $ 943 &#160; $ 443 &#160; Average common shares issued and outstanding 1,441,200 &#160; 1,125,039 &#160; 1,439,814 &#160; 1,071,276 &#160; Basic earnings per common share $ 0.35 &#160; $ ( 0.05 ) $ 0.65 &#160; $ 0.41 &#160; Diluted earnings per common share: Dilutive potential common shares: Stock options and restricted stock units and awards 15,545 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17,587 &#160; 17,667 &#160; Shares held in deferred compensation plans 6,548 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,409 &#160; 5,531 &#160; Dilutive potential common shares 22,093 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23,996 &#160; 23,198 &#160; Total diluted average common shares issued and outstanding 1,463,293 &#160; 1,125,039 &#160; 1,463,810 &#160; 1,094,474 &#160; Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.35 &#160; $ ( 0.05 ) $ 0.64 &#160; $ 0.40 &#160; Anti-dilutive awards (1) 11,550 &#160; 26,895 &#160; 6,333 &#160; 2,738 &#160;

12. NONINTEREST INCOME 

Huntington earns a variety of revenue including interest and fees from customers as well as revenues from non-customers. Certain sources of revenue are recognized within interest or fee income and are outside of the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). Other sources of revenue fall within the scope of ASC 606 and are generally recognized within noninterest income. These revenues are included within various sections of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table shows Huntington&#8217;s total noninterest income segregated between contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606 and those within the scope of other GAAP Topics.

Huntington generally provides services for customers in which it acts as principal. Payment terms and conditions vary amongst services and customers, and thus impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Some fees may be paid before any service is rendered and accordingly, such fees are deferred until the obligations pertaining to those fees are satisfied. Most Huntington contracts with customers are cancelable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended June 30, 2022 is expected to be earned within one year. Huntington does not have significant balances of contract assets or contract liabilities and any change in those balances during the reporting period ended June 30, 2022 was determined to be immaterial. 

13. FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

See Note 19 &#8220;Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

The following tables present a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3. The classification of an item as Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 measurements may also include observable components of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. The amounts presented represent the fair value on the various measurement dates throughout the period.

The amounts measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows:

Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans held for investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. Periodically, in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized in the form of a charge-off.

(1) Certain disclosures related to quantitative level 3 fair value measurements do not include those deemed to be immaterial. 

The following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. 

Credit loss estimates, such as probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve. 

Discount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values. 

Net market price and pull through percentages generally increase when market interest rates increase and decline when market interest rates decline. Higher net market price and pull through percentages generally result in higher fair values.

(1) Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties. 

(2) Excludes securities without readily determinable fair values. 

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include trading account securities, customers&#8217; acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, FHLB advances, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in banks, interest-bearing deposits at FRB, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under resale agreements. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington&#8217;s exposure to changes in customer credit quality. Accordingly, their carrying values, which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates, are reasonable estimates of fair value. 

Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage servicing rights, deposit base, and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above. Accordingly, this fair value information is not intended to, and does not, represent Huntington&#8217;s underlying value. Many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates.

14. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or a liability (in other assets or other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value. 

Derivative financial instruments can be designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses on the hedging instruments in the income statement line item where the gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated in an effective hedge relationship under GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur. 

The following table presents the fair values and notional values of all derivative instruments included in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Amounts in the table below are presented gross without the impact of any net collateral arrangements.

Derivatives used in asset and liability management activities 

Huntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity, principally for asset and liability management purposes. Balance sheet hedging activity is generally arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment that can be classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are executed to hedge changes in fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Cash flow hedges are executed to modify interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. 

2022 2Q Form 10-Q 79 

The following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments.

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. Adjustments to interest income were also recorded for the amounts related to the amortization of floors and forward-starting floors that were excluded from the hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of economic hedges, as well as the amounts related to terminated hedges reclassified from AOCI. The net amounts resulted in an increase to net interest income of $ 48 million and $ 5 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, the net amounts resulted in an increase to net interest income of $ 87 million and $ 230 million, respectively. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings and offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item. 

Huntington has designated $ 9.0 billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the portfolio layer method. This approach allows the Company to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value portfolio level basis adjustment on our hedged mortgage-backed securities is not included in available-for-sale securities on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Huntington has also designated $ 869 million of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate corporate bonds.

The following table presents the change in fair value for derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

As of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges. 

Amortized Cost Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment To Hedged Items (dollar amounts in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Assets Investment securities (1) $ 18,089 &#160; $ 17,150 &#160; $ ( 708 ) $ ( 117 ) Liabilities Long-term debt (2) 4,486 &#160; 1,981 &#160; ( 92 ) 45 &#160; 

(1) Amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio layer method. The hedged item is a layer of the closed portfolio which is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. As of June 30, 2022, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 17.3 billion, the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was $ 608 million, and the amounts of the designated hedging instruments were $ 9.0 billion. 

(2) Excluded from the above table are the cumulative amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining for long-term debt for which hedge accounting has been discontinued in the amounts of $ 4 million at June 30, 2022 and $ 17 million at December 31, 2021. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

At June 30, 2022, Huntington has $ 14.5 billion of interest rate swaps and collars. These are designated as cash flow hedges for variable rate commercial loans. The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in OCI and is reclassified into income when the hedged item impacts earnings. The initial premium paid for the interest rate collar contracts represents the time value of the contracts and is not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness. Any change in fair value related to time value is recognized in OCI. The initial premium paid is amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to interest income over the contractual life of these contracts. 

Gains and (losses) on interest rate floors, floor spreads, and swaps recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) after-tax were $( 86 ) million and $( 34 ) million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, gains and losses on interest rate floors and swaps recognized in other comprehensive income were $( 326 ) million and $( 102 ) million, respectively.

Derivatives used in mortgage banking activities 

Mortgage loan origination hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to economically hedging Huntington&#8217;s mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is committed or locked. Forward commitments to sell economically hedge the possible loss on interest rate lock commitments due to interest rate change. The net asset position of these derivatives at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $ 5 million and $ 15 million, respectively. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $ 1.4 billion and $ 2.1 billion, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year . 

MSR hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR asset and to mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR asset, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, TBA securities, Treasury futures contracts, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps. 

The notional value of the derivative financial instruments, the corresponding net asset (liability) position recognized in other assets and/or other liabilities, and net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging activity is summarized in the following table: 

(dollar amounts in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional value $ 975 &#160; $ 1,330 &#160; Trading assets 2 &#160; 19 &#160; Trading liabilities ( 53 ) &#8212; &#160;

MSR hedging trading assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Trading gains (losses) are included in mortgage banking income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Derivatives used in customer related activities 

Various derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consist of commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange contracts. Huntington enters into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities. 

The interest rate or price risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Foreign currency derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. Transactions are primarily in liquid currencies with Canadian dollars and Euros comprising a majority of all transactions. Commodity derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of various commodities. Hedging of energy-related products and base metals comprise the majority of these transactions.

The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were $ 72 million and $ 51 million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including offsetting derivatives, were $ 43.5 billion and $ 45.1 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Huntington&#8217;s credit risk from customer derivatives was $ 136 million and $ 551 million at the same dates, respectively. 

Financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 

Huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 13 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221;. 

Derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Additionally, collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and Huntington&#8217;s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups. 

Huntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties, and routinely exchanges cash and high quality securities collateral. Huntington enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment and risk management needs. These types of transactions generally are low dollar volume. Huntington enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties; however, collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties. 

In addition to the customer derivative credit exposure, aggregate credit risk associated with broker-dealer and bank derivative transactions, net of collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty, was $ 293 million and $ 44 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The credit risk associated with derivatives is calculated after considering master netting agreements. 

At June 30, 2022, Huntington pledged $ 285 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged $ 782 million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral. 

The following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Trust-Preferred Securities 

Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as such, are not consolidated within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

A list of trust preferred securities outstanding at June 30, 2022 follows:

(3) Variable effective rate at June 30, 2022, based on three-month LIBOR + 1.40 %. 

Each issue of the junior subordinated debentures has an interest rate equal to the corresponding trust securities distribution rate. Huntington has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time-to-time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the related debentures. During any such extension period, distributions to the trust securities will also be deferred and Huntington&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will be restricted. Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to trust securities are guaranteed by Huntington to the extent of funds held by the trusts. The guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as the junior subordinated debt. The guarantee does not place a limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by Huntington.

Affordable Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. 

Huntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in other assets. Investments that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Investment losses are included in Other noninterest income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table presents the balances of Huntington&#8217;s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

Commitments to extend credit 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these financial agreements at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were as follows: 

(dollar amounts in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 

Contract amount representing credit risk 

Commitments to extend credit: 

Commercial 

$ 29,398 &#160; $ 27,933 &#160; Consumer 

19,501 &#160; 18,513 &#160; Commercial real estate 3,437 &#160; 3,042 &#160; Standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds 713 &#160; 694 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 

15 &#160; 36 &#160; 

Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer&#8217;s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. Collateral to secure any funding of these commitments predominately consists of residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans. 

Standby letters-of-credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years . Since the conditions under which Huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize, the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was $ 16 million and $ 7 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Commercial letters-of-credit represent short-term, self-liquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days . The goods or cargo being traded normally secure these instruments. 

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings. 

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, Huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each matter may be. 

Huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. 

86 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

For certain matters, Huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In cases in which Huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is $ 0 to $ 15 million at June 30, 2022 in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent Huntington&#8217;s maximum loss exposure. 

Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Huntington. Further, management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address Huntington&#8217;s contingent liabilities. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond Huntington&#8217;s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to Huntington&#8217;s results of operations for any particular reporting period. 

17. SEGMENT REPORTING 

Huntington&#8217;s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. The Company has four major business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense.
