EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

On June 9, 2021, Huntington closed the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation. Historical periods prior to June 9, 2021 reflect results of legacy Huntington operations. Subsequent to closing, results reflect all post-acquisition activity. See Note 3 &#8220;Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation&#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

On March 1, 2022, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Capstone Partners, a top tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm. The transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2022, subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 

Summary of 2022 First Quarter Results Compared to 2021 First Quarter 

For the quarter, we reported net income of $460 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, compared with $532 million, or $0.48 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter. The 2022 first quarter reported net income benefited from the TCF acquisition and organic growth, while the year-ago quarter was favorably impacted by the provision for credit losses benefit and the mark-to-market of interest rate caps. 

Net interest income was $1.1 billion, up $174 million, or 18% from the year-ago quarter. FTE net interest income increased $176 million, or 18%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit from a $48.3 billion, or 42%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 60 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 2.88%. Average earning asset growth included a $30.9 billion, or 38%, increase in average loans and leases and a $16.5 billion, or 63% increase in average securities. The year-over-year decrease in NIM was driven by the 2021 first quarter benefit of a $144 million mark-to-market adjustment on interest rate caps and a $34 million decrease in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments, partially offset by an increase in securities yields and the 2022 first quarter benefit of $19 million of net interest income from purchase accounting accretion. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 5 

The provision for credit losses increased $85 million from the year-ago quarter to $25 million in the 2022 first quarter. The ACL increased $368 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.1 billion, or 1.87%, of total loans and leases, compared to $1.7 billion, or 2.17% of total loans and leases, primarily due to the acquisition of TCF and organic loan and lease growth. The decrease in ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases reflected the overall continued genera l improvement in economic conditions, however both inflationary and geopolitical risks remain. NCOs decreased $45 million from the year-ago-quarter to $19 million. Total NCOs represented an annualized 0.07% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, down from 0.32% in the year-ago quarter. 

Noninterest income was $499 million, an increase of $104 million, or 26%, and noninterest expense increased $260 million, or 33%, from the year-ago quarter. The increases in both noninterest income and noninterest expense were primarily impacted by the acquisition of TCF. 

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.28% at March 31, 2022 , down 60 bas is points from December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in tangible common equity related to higher interest rates causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio was 9.22%, down fr om 9.33% from December 31, 2021 . The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.84% compared to 10.99% at December 31, 2021 . Th e decrease i n regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by growth in risk-weighted assets. 

During the 2022 first quarter, considering the pending acquisition of Capstone Partners and growth in the loan and lease portfolio, Huntington repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization. In July of 2021, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of common shares which began the third quarter of 2021 and goes through the second quarter of 2022. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. As of March 31, 2022, Huntington has completed $650 million of the share repurchase authorization.

COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption that has affected daily living and has negatively impacted the economy. As further discussed in &#8220;Discussion of Results of Operations,&#8221; the volatility in the markets and economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic continue to have impact. 

Huntington reacted quickly to the changes required by the pandemic as a result of the commitment and flexibility of our colleagues coupled with well-prepared business continuity plans. We continue to make progress towards our new operating model and have begun to welcome more of our colleagues back to the office as part of our Coming Back Together plan. We offer Workplace Flex to help employees achieve work/life harmony in support of the business. We achieve this with flexible work arrangements, parental leave, and other health, wellness and financial benefits and services that assist employees and their families. We continue to monitor the impact of the virus and evolving government guidelines.

Throughout the pandemic, we have worked with our customers to originate and renew business loans as well as originate loans made available through the SBA PPP, a lending program established as part of the relief to American consumers and businesses in the CARES Act. During the 2022 first quarter, we continued to work with our customers who received PPP loan forgiveness, though we have not had any new originations. Through March 2022, $10.1 billion of the PPP loans have been forgiven by the SBA of the original $11.4 billion of PPP loans originated by both Huntington and TCF prior to acquisition. As of March 31, 2022, we have outstanding PPP loan balances of $645 million, net of forgiveness and customer payments, with balances continuing to decline. 

Economy 

Growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, have contributed to rising inflation. In response, the FRB has begun raising interest rates and signaled that it will continue to raise rates, taper its purchase of mortgage and other bonds and reduce the size of the balance sheet over time. The timing and impact of inflation and rising interest rates on our business and related financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. 

We delivered positive results this quarter, driven by continued execution of strategic initiatives and loan and lease growth. Additionally, we saw net interest income expansion, deposit growth and demonstrated disciplined expense management with continued reductions in noninterest expense. Credit continues to perform well in keeping with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile through-the-cycle. Through our disciplined and proactive approach, we believe Huntington is well positioned to manage through the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. We continue to look forward with optimism and remain focused on delivering profitable growth.

10 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

2022 First Quarter versus 2021 First Quarter 

Net interest income for the 2022 first quarter increased $174 million, or 18%, from the 2021 first quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the 2022 first quarter increased $176 million, or 18%, from the 2021 first quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflects the benefit of a $48.3 billion, or 42%, increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 60 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 2.88%. The increase in average total earning assets included a $30.9 billion, or 38%, increase in average total loans and leases and a $16.5 billion, or 63%, increase in average securities . Average balances across earning asset categories for the 2022 first quarter reflect the late second-quarter 2021 TCF acquisition in addition to organic growth. The increase in average securities additionally reflected the purchase of securities to deploy excess liquidity and manage liquidity position. 

The NIM compression was driven by the 2021 first quarter benefit of a $144 million mark-to-market adjustment on interest rate caps and a $34 million decrease in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA, partially offset by an increase in securities yields and the 2022 first quarter benefit of $19 million of net interest income from purchase accounting accretion. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Credit Risk &#8221; section.) 

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the credit allowance at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio, securities portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. 

The provision for credit losses for the 2022 first quarter was $25 million, an increase of $85 million, compared to the 2021 first quarter. The 2022 first quarter provision for credit losses is comprised of $7 million of provision for loan and lease losses, $14 million of provision for unfunded lending commitments and $4 million of provision for securities. The 2021 first quarter provision for credit losses is comprised of $47 million of provision benefit for loan and lease losses and $13 million of provision benefit for unfunded commitments. The ACL increased $368 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.1 billion, or 1.87%, of total loans and leases, compared to $1.7 billion, or 2.17% of total loans and leases, primarily due to the acquisition of TCF and additional organic loan and lease growth. The decrease in ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases primarily reflected the overall continued genera l improvement in economic conditions, however both inflationary and geopolitical risks remain. 

Noninterest Income 

The following table reflects noninterest income for each of the periods presented:

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 11 

2022 First Quarter versus 2021 First Quarter 

Noninterest income for the 2022 first quarter was $499 million, an increase of $104 million, or 26%, from the year-ago quarter. Noninterest income for the 2022 first quarter was impacted by the June 2021 acquisition of TCF. Gain on sale of loans increased $25 million, primarily due to resuming the sale of SBA loans in the 2022 first quarter. Other noninterest income increased $19 million, or 63%, primarily reflecting purchase accounting accretion from acquired unfunded lending commitments and increased amortization of upfront card-related contract renewal fees, partially offset by decreased mezzanine investment income. Trust and investment management services increased $13 million, or 25%, reflecting continued strong sales, positive equity market performance, and the TCF acquisition. Capital markets fees increased $13 million, or 45%, primarily reflecting higher interest rate derivative fees, foreign exchange fees and loan syndication. All other increases were primarily a result of the impact of the TCF acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases, mortgage banking income decreased $51 million, or 51%, primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and salable originations. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table reflects noninterest expense for each of the periods presented: &#160;

12 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

2022 First Quarter versus 2021 First Quarter 

Noninterest expense for the 2022 first quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of $260 million, or 33%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition including a $25 million increase in acquisition-related expenses. Personnel costs increased $112 million, or 24%, primarily reflecting a 28% increase in average full-time equivalent employees as a result of the TCF acquisition. Outside data processing and other services increased $50 million, or 43%, reflecting acquisition-related expenses and technology related expenses. Equipment expense increased $35 million, or 76%, reflecting acquisition-related expenses and timing of technology equipment purchases and amortization. All other increases were primarily a result of the impact of the TCF acquisition. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes in the 2022 first quarter was $105 million, compared to $102 million in the 2021 first quarter. Both periods included the benefits from general business credits, capital losses, tax-exempt income, tax-exempt bank owned life insurance income, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. The effective tax rates for the 2022 first quarter and 2021 first quarter were 18.5% and 16.1%, respectively. The variance between the 2022 first quarter compared to the 2021 first quarter provision for income taxes and effective tax rates relates primarily to higher state tax expense and nondeductible items. The net federal deferred tax asset was $242 million and the net state deferred tax asset was $33 million at March 31, 2022. 

We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009. The 2010 and 2011 tax years remain under exam by the IRS. While the statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2012 through 2020, the IRS has advised that tax years 2012 through 2014 will not be audited and is currently examining the 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. Also, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2017.

We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with our Board of Directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle. Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access management, and authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. 

We believe that our primary risk exposures are credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance. More information on risk can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors below, the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The MD&#38;A included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with this MD&#38;A as this discussion provides only material updates to the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&#38;A should also be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , and other information contained in this report. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios (see Note 3 &#8220; Investment Securities and Other Securities &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 13 

We focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our ongoing expansion of portfolio management resources is central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.

Our loan portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation.

Credit Quality 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 4 &#8220; Loans / Leases &#8221; and Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance. 

Credit quality performance in the 2022 first quarter reflected NCOs of $19 million, or 0.07% of average total loans and leases, annualized, a decrease of $45 million, compared to $64 million, or 0.32%, in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by a $59 million reduction in Commercial NCOs resulting in net recoveries of $10 million in 2022 first quarter, partially offset by a $14 million increase in Consumer NCOs. NPAs decreased from the prior year end by $42 million, or 6%, largely driven by a decrease in commercial and industrial NALs.

NPAs and NALs 

Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $475 million of commercial related NALs at March 31, 2022, $324 million, or 68%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management.

ACL 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Our ACL is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. 

We use statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on three key parameters: PD, EAD, and LGD. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period (two to three years), the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario. 

16 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the appropriate committee governance channels described below. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and GDP. The probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period and determined through our ACL process. Any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management. Additionally, we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios. Lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics, risk ratings, origination credit bureau scores, delinquency status, and remaining months within loan agreements, among other factors. 

The baseline scenario used for the 2022 first quarter assumes that the worst of the economic disruption from the pandemic has passed, with the expectation that subsequent waves of the virus will not carry the same level of economic disruption experienced to date. 

The table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment rate and GDP has changed since the end of 2021: 

Table 8 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables Baseline scenario forecast 2021 2022 2023 Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Unemployment rate (1) 4Q 2021 4.5 % 3.7 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 1Q 2022 N/A 3.7 3.4 3.4 3.4 Gross Domestic Product (1) 4Q 2021 6.6 % 3.6 % 2.5 % 2.9 % 2.8 % 1Q 2022 N/A 6.1 2.5 2.9 2.9 (1) Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts. 

Management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including those related to geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and considered multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to address such uncertainty. While we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our ACL, the ultimate impact the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions and the related inflationary pressures will have on the economy remains uncertain. 

Management develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our governance committees reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transactional reserve (collectively assessed) will continue to utilize scenario weighting. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the March 31, 2022 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles related to the potential economic impacts of geopolitical instability and the commercial real estate portfolio, to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

Our ACL methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date. The loss modeling process uses an EAD concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments, where appropriate. Losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as AULC within other liabilities in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. A liability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized if Huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 17 

The AULC is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. (See Note 1 &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.) 

Our ACL evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to current performance. For more information, including the ALLL and AULC activity by portfolio segment, refer to Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan categories and the reported ACL:

(1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases. 

At March 31, 2022, the ACL was $2.1 billion, or 1.87% of total loans and leases, compared to $2.1 billion, or 1.89%, at December 31, 2021. The decrease in ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases reflects the overall continued general improvement in economic conditions, however both inflationary and geopolitical risks remain.

Market Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going market risk management processes.) 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. 

We measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition, and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business. 

In measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet, we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts, and &#8220;ramp&#8221; scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, we presume that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon. 

We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net interest income at risk (NII at risk) and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis (EVE at Risk). 

Table 11 - Net Interest Income at Risk &#160; Net Interest Income at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -25 +100 +200 March 31, 2022 -1.8 3.1 6.0 December 31, 2021 -2.4 4.6 8.9 

The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual &#8220;ramp&#8221; +100 and +200 basis point parallel shift scenarios, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months, as well as an immediate parallel &#8220;shock&#8221; scenario of -25 basis points. 

The NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The change in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in market interest rate expectations, and the size and mix of the balance sheet. 

Table 12 - Economic Value of Equity at Risk &#160; Economic Value of Equity at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -25 +100 +200 March 31, 2022 0.5 -3.6 -8.8 December 31, 2021 -0.1 -1.5 -5.6 

The EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios. 

As of March 31, 2022, EVE at risk sensitivities have increased since December 31, 2021. The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by changes in the spot market rate curve extending the duration of the securities portfolio and shortening the duration of liabilities. 

20 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

We have LIBOR-based exposure in the form of variable rate loans, derivatives, Series B preferred stock, long term debt and other securities and financial arrangements. To address the discontinuance of LIBOR in its current form, we established a LIBOR transition team and project plan under the oversight of the CRO and CFO, providing periodic updates to the ROC. As of December 31, 2021, Huntington ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans. Contract remediation efforts coordinated by the LIBOR transition team are scheduled for completion by June 2023. Source systems have been updated to support alternative reference rates. At this time alternative reference rates are predominantly SOFR based. As such, we have developed a SOFR-enabled interest rate risk monitoring framework and a strategy for managing interest rate risk during the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. We continue to monitor market developments and legislative and regulatory updates. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps. 

Table 13 shows all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 &#8220; Derivative Financial Instruments &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

MSRs 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 &#8220; Mortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights &#8221; of Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .) 

At March 31, 2022, we had a total of $416 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $31.6 billion in mortgage loans. 

MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. 

MSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Price Risk 

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held. 

Liquidity Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going liquidity risk management processes.) 

Our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base. Core deposits comprised approximately 98% of total deposits at March 31, 2022. We also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity, including advances from the FHLB, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. Liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $11.9 billion as of March 31, 2022. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are consumer and commercial core deposits. At March 31, 2022, these core deposits funded 81% of total assets (127% of total loans). Other sources of liquidity include non-core deposits, FHLB advances, wholesale debt instruments, and securitizations. Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $20 million and $29 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

(1) Includes consumer certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more. 

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. Total loans and securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and the FHLB are $85.4 billion at March 31, 2022. 

At March 31, 2022, the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, security repurchase agreements, and to support borrowing capacity totaled $30.3 billion. There were no securities of a single issuer, which are not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2022. 

To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding, asset securitization or sale. Sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, negotiable CDs, brokered and other deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. Our wholesale funding for both the Bank and parent company totaled $10.7 billion at March 31, 2022, compared to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease from year-end is primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt. 

At March 31, 2022, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company&#8217;s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. 

The parent company had $2.8 billion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 in cash and cash equivalents. 

24 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

On April 20, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.155 per common share. The dividend is payable on July 1, 2022, to shareholders of record on June 17, 2022. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.155 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $223 million per quarter. Additionally, on April 20, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G and Series H Preferred Stock dividend payable on July 15, 2022 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2022. On March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I Preferred Stock payable on June 1, 2022 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2022. Total cash demands required for Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I are expected to be approximately $28 million per quarter. 

During the first three months of 2022, the Bank paid preferred and common dividends to the parent company of $11 million and $394 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities. 

At March 31, 2022, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, caps and floors, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. 

We actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats have increased, primarily through phishing campaigns. We are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns. We have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce is now working remotely. 

Our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our board-level Technology Committee, as appropriate. As a complement to the overall cyber security risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 25 

To govern operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and our Audit Committee, as appropriate. Significant findings or issues are escalated by the Third Party Risk Management Committee to the Technology Committee of the Board, as appropriate. 

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk-monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance. 

Compliance Risk 

Financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. 

Capital 

Both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the Company&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are adequate. 

26 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

The following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and Bank levels for each of the periods presented: 

Table 15 - Regulatory Capital Data (1) (dollar amounts in millions) &#160; March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total risk-weighted assets Consolidated $ 134,493 $ 131,266 Bank 133,779 130,597 CET 1 risk-based capital Consolidated 12,397 12,249 Bank 13,298 13,261 Tier 1 risk-based capital Consolidated 14,574 14,426 Bank 14,491 14,445 Tier 2 risk-based capital Consolidated 2,949 2,821 Bank 2,156 1,982 Total risk-based capital Consolidated 17,523 17,246 Bank 16,647 16,427 CET 1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 9.22 % 9.33 % Bank 9.94 10.15 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 10.84 10.99 Bank 10.83 11.06 Total risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 13.03 13.14 Bank 12.44 12.58 Tier 1 leverage ratio Consolidated 8.43 8.56 Bank 8.41 8.60 

(1) Huntington elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period which began January 1, 2022 pursuant to a rule that allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. As of March 31, 2022, we have phased in 25% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remainder of the three-year transition period. 

At March 31, 2022, we maintained Basel III capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the FRB. Th e decrease i n regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by growth in risk-weighted assets. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

We generate shareholders&#8217; equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders&#8217; equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $18.5 billion at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $845 million or 4% when compared with December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest rates causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. 

Huntington&#8217;s SCB requirement is 2.5%, which is the minimum under the SCB framework. Huntington is authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the FRB&#8217;s capital rule, inclusive of the SCB requirement. 

Dividends 

We consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. Our strong capital positions us to take advantage of additional capital management opportunities. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 27 

Share Repurchases 

From time to time the Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board of Directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. 

In July of 2021, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of common shares which began the third quarter of 2021 and goes through the second quarter of 2022. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the 2022 first quarter, considering the pending acquisition of Capstone Partners and growth in the loan and lease portfolio, Huntington repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization. As of March 31, 2022, Huntington has completed $650 million of the share repurchase authorization. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION 

Overview 

Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. We have four major business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. 

Business segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. 

Revenue Sharing 

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. 

Expense Allocation 

The management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) 

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities).

2022 First Three Months versus 2021 First Three Months 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $140 million in the three-month period of 2022, compared to $118 million in the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $219 million, or 110%, primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, and a 46 basis point increase in net interest margin driven by an increase in loan spread inclusive of purchase accounting accretion. The provision for credit losses increased $126 million, driven by an increase in loan and lease growth, partially offset by overall continued general improvement in economic conditions, noting that both inflationary and geopolitical risks remain. Noninterest income increased $53 million, or 60%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition in addition to an increase in commitment and other loan fees including higher interest rate derivative fees, foreign exchange fees and loan syndication, partially offset by decreased mezzanine investment income. Noninterest expense increased $115 million, or 86%, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, largely driven by higher personnel expense reflecting an increase in the number of FTE employees, allocated overhead and operating lease expense.

Consumer and Business Banking, including Home Lending, reported net income of $181 million in the three-month period of 2022, an increase of $70 million, or 63%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $122 million, or 36%, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition, partially offset by a 21 basis point decrease in net interest margin driven by a decline in loan margin due to a decrease in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA. The provision for credit losses decreased $73 million, to a provision for credit losses benefit of $109 million, primarily due to continued general improvement in economic conditions, noting that both inflationary and geopolitical risks remain, partially offset by an increase in loan growth. Noninterest income increased $36 million, or 15%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, primarily due to higher interchange income and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by decreased mortgage banking income reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable originations. Noninterest expense increased $143 million, or 30%, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition largely driven by higher personnel expense reflecting an increase in the number of FTE employees and allocated overhead. 

Home Lending, an operating unit of Consumer and Business Banking, reflects the result of the origination, sale, and servicing of mortgage loans less referral fees and net interest income for mortgage banking products distributed by the retail branch network and other business segments. Home Lending reported net income of $87 million in the three-month period of 2022, compared with net income of $24 million in the year-ago period. Net interest income improved $48 million, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition, reduction in prepayment activity and increased retention. The provision for credit losses decreased $83 million, primarily due to continued general improvement in economic conditions. Noninterest income decreased $44 million, driven primarily by lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable originations.

Vehicle Finance reported net income of $67 million in the three-month period of 2022, a decrease of $9 million, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $13 million, or 12%, primarily due to a 9 basis point increase in the net interest margin coupled with a $1.4 billion increase in average loans and leases. The provision for credit losses increased $15 million, or 68%, primarily due to a slower pace of reserve release than the year-ago period, mostly driven by uncertainties surrounding inflation and geopolitical risks. Noninterest income was relatively unchanged from the year-ago period. Noninterest expense increased $10 million, or 29%, largely attributable to higher production related costs and geographic expansion.

RBHPCG reported net income of $19 million for the first three-month period of 2022, a decrease of $6 million, or 24%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $15 million, or 44%, due to a 11 basis point increase in net interest margin, largely driven by higher benefit in deposit spreads. Average loans and leases increased $1.6 billion, or 25%, due to growth in both commercial and residential real estate mortgages, and the impact of the TCF acquisition. Average deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 35%, primarily related to higher customer liquidity levels, and impact of the acquired TCF deposit portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased $17 million, largely due to loan growth. Noninterest income increased $13 million, or 25%, reflecting higher sales production, overall market performance, and the impact of the TCF acquisition. Total assets under management increased 17% due to positive net asset flows, equity markets, and the impact of the TCF acquisition. Noninterest expense increased $19 million primarily due to an increase in personnel expense impacted by the TCF acquisition. 

Treasury / Other 

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives (including the mark-to-market of interest rate caps in the 2021 first quarter), and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. 

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity as well as the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, acquisition-related expenses, if any, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. 

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis 

Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent. We encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 33 

Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; Tangible equity to tangible assets, and 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel III definitions. 

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 

Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company&#8217;s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A . 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL at March 31, 2022 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate. 

34 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around a substantially higher number of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths than the baseline scenario, causing some state and local governments to impose restrictions. As a result, consumer spending declines significantly sending the economy back into recession in the second quarter of 2022. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate rapidly increases and remains elevated for a prolonged period, the rate is estimated at 7.4% and 7.2% at the end of 2022 and 2023 respectively. These numbers result in unemployment rates that are approximately 4.0% and 3.8% higher than baseline scenario projections of 3.4% and 3.4%, respectively for the same time periods. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at March 31, 2022, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and a 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $2.4 billion at March 31, 2022. This hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models. 

The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The highly uncertain economic environment; 

&#8226; The difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework. 

We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. For more information, see Note 4 &#8220; Loans and Leases &#8221; and Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Fair Value Measurement 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including securities, and derivative instruments. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions, adjustments and judgment including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, cash flows, default rates, loss rates, terminal values and liquidation values. A significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value, which in turn, may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 35 

The fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available. Our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2 in fair value hierarchy), when available. The level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value. The fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy, additional discussion regarding fair value measurements, and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs, can be found in Note 12 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. This typically results in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life, which is also subjective. Customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets, including but not limited to, customer deposit intangibles.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Huntington reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position, the results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include descriptions of significant accounting policies, as updated by the information contained in this report, should be read in conjunction with these interim financial statements. 

For statement of cash flow purposes, cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits at Federal Reserve Bank. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year&#8217;s presentation. 

Effective at the beginning of the 2022 first quarter, a new classification within the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of accrued income and other receivables was established comprised of activity that was previously classified as loans and leases (other consumer loans and leases) and other assets. All prior period amounts and all related metrics have been revised to conform to the current presentation. 

In conjunction with applicable accounting standards, all material subsequent events have been either recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosed in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material subsequent events to disclose for the current period.

2. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 

Accounting standards yet to be adopted 

Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements ASU 2021-08-Business Combinations (Topic 805) Issued October 2021 &#8226; The amendments in this update require that an acquirer apply topic 606 to the recognition and measurement of revenue contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. 

&#8226; Effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

&#8226; Adoption of the ASU will be applied prospectively to all business combinations occurring after the adoption date, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects to early adopt in an interim period should retroactively adjust for any business combination that occurred during the annual period of adoption, this includes the interim period. 

&#8226; The update is not expected to have a material impact on Huntington&#8217;s Consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2022-01-Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method Issued March 2022 &#8226; The amendments in this update expands the current last-of-layer method to allow for multiple hedged layers in a single closed portfolio. To reflect the expansion, the last-of-layer method has been renamed the portfolio layer method. The standard also expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include nonprepayable financial assets. 

&#8226; Effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. Adoption of the ASU will be applied on a modified retrospective basis by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earning on the initial application date, except for the amendments related to disclosures. Disclosure amendments may be applied either prospectively from the initial adoption date or on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted on any date after the issuance of the standard, if adopted in an interim period the effects of adopting amendments related to basis adjustments should be reflected at the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. 

&#8226; The ASU also gives entities the options to reclassify debt securities classified in the held-to-maturity category at the date of adoption to the available-for-sale category if the entity applies the portfolio layer method hedging to one or more closed portfolios that include those debt securities. 

&#8226; Huntington is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its Consolidated financial statements based on which transactions Huntington may apply the portfolio layer method. 

ASU 2022-02- Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures Issued March 2022 &#8226; The amendments in this update eliminates TDR accounting for entities that have adopted Update 2016-13, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The ASU also requires current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. 

&#8226; Effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

&#8226; Adoption of the ASU will be applied prospectively, except for the portion of the standard related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs an entity may elect to use a modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption. An entity that elects to early adopt in an interim period should apply the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. An entity may also chose to early adopt the amendments about TDRs and related disclosure enhancements separately from amendments about vintage disclosures. 

&#8226; Huntington is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its Consolidated financial statements, as well as which adoption method to apply.

During the 2022 first quarter, Huntington transferred $ 4.2 billion of securities from the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio. At the time of the transfer, AOCI included $ 58 million of net unrealized losses (after-tax) attributed to these securities. This loss will be amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the securities. 

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, security repurchase agreements and to support borrowing capacity totaled $ 30.3 billion and $ 21.7 billion, respectively. There were no securities of a single issuer, which were not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at either March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, all HTM debt securities are considered AAA rated. In addition, there were no HTM debt securities considered past due at March 31, 2022. 

Based on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability of cash flows, as of March 31, 2022, Huntington has concluded that except for one municipal bond classified as an AFS debt security for which a charge-off of $ 4 million was recognized, it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio. There was no allowance related to investment securities as of March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

Lease Financing 

Huntington leases equipment to customers, and substantially all such arrangements are classified as either sales-type or direct financing leases, which are included in commercial loans and leases. These leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income, and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases. 

Huntington assesses net investments in leases (including residual values) for impairment and recognizes any impairment losses in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investments in leases may be reduced by an ACL, with changes recognized as provision expense. 

The following table presents net investments in lease financing receivables by category at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit Quality Indicators 

See Note 5 &#8220;Loans/Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the credit quality indicators Huntington utilizes for monitoring credit quality and for determining an appropriate ACL level. 

To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality for commercial loans, and for purposes of determining an appropriate ACL level for these loans, Huntington utilizes the following internally defined categories of credit grades: 

&#8226; Pass - Higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 

&#8226; OLEM - The credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect Huntington&#8217;s position in the future. For these reasons, Huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Substandard - Inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, equity, and/or the collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. It is likely Huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated. 

&#8226; Doubtful - Loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high. 

Loans are generally assigned a category of &#8220; Pass &#8221; rating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrower&#8217;s financial performance. 

Commercial loans categorized as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are considered Criticized loans. Commercial loans categorized as Substandard or Doubtful are both considered Classified loans. 

For all classes within the consumer loan portfolios, loans are assigned pool level PD factors based on the FICO range within which the borrower&#8217;s credit bureau score falls. A credit bureau score is a credit score developed by FICO based on data provided by the credit bureaus. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher the credit bureau score, the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore, an indicator of higher credit quality. 

Huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics. The classifications described above, and also presented in the table below, represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes.

TDR Loans 

TDRs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered TDRs when the concessions provided would not otherwise be considered. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. See Note 5 &#8220;Loans / Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of TDRs. 

The following table presents, by class and modification type, the number of contracts, post-modification outstanding balance, and the financial effects of the modification for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Roll-forward 

The following tables present ACL activity by portfolio segment for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. 

(dollar amounts in millions) Commercial Consumer Total Three-month period ended March 31, 2022: ALLL balance, beginning of period $ 1,462 &#160; $ 568 &#160; $ 2,030 &#160; Loan and lease charge-offs ( 31 ) ( 50 ) ( 81 ) Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged-off 40 &#160; 22 &#160; 62 &#160; Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 43 &#160; ( 36 ) 7 &#160; ALLL balance, end of period $ 1,514 &#160; $ 504 &#160; $ 2,018 &#160; AULC balance, beginning of period $ 41 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 77 &#160; Provision (benefit) for unfunded lending commitments 16 &#160; ( 2 ) 14 &#160; AULC balance, end of period $ 57 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 91 &#160; ACL balance, end of period $ 1,571 &#160; $ 538 &#160; $ 2,109 &#160; 

(dollar amounts in millions) Commercial Consumer Total Three-month period ended March 31, 2021: ALLL balance, beginning of period $ 1,236 &#160; $ 578 &#160; $ 1,814 &#160; Loan and lease charge-offs ( 61 ) ( 34 ) ( 95 ) Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged-off 12 &#160; 19 &#160; 31 &#160; Provision for loan and lease losses 10 &#160; ( 57 ) ( 47 ) ALLL balance, end of period $ 1,197 &#160; $ 506 &#160; $ 1,703 &#160; AULC balance, beginning of period $ 34 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 52 &#160; Provision (benefit) for unfunded lending commitments ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 13 ) Unfunded lending commitment losses ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) AULC balance, end of period $ 27 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 38 &#160; ACL balance, end of period $ 1,224 &#160; $ 517 &#160; $ 1,741 &#160; 

At March 31, 2022, the ACL was $ 2.1 billion, an increase of $ 2 million from the December 31, 2021 balance of $ 2.1 billion. 

The economic scenarios used in the March 31, 2022 ACL determination contained significant judgmental assumptions due to elevated levels of economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the March 31, 2022 ACL included general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles related to the potential economic impacts of geopolitical instability and the commercial real estate portfolio, to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

6. MORTGAGE LOAN SALES AND SERVICING RIGHTS 

Residential Mortgage Portfolio 

The following table summarizes activity relating to residential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Three Months Ended March 31, (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Residential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained $ 1,934 &#160; $ 2,256 &#160; Pretax gains resulting from above loan sales (1) 59 &#160; 93 &#160; 

(1) Recorded in mortgage banking income. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 55 

The following table summarizes the changes in MSRs recorded using the fair value method for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Three Months Ended March 31, (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Fair value, beginning of period $ 351 &#160; $ 210 &#160; New servicing assets created 29 &#160; 33 &#160; Change in fair value during the period due to: Time decay (1) ( 5 ) ( 3 ) Payoffs (2) ( 10 ) ( 17 ) Changes in valuation inputs or assumptions (3) 51 &#160; 51 &#160; Fair value, end of period $ 416 &#160; $ 274 &#160; Weighted-average life (years) 7.5 7.0 

(1) Represents decrease in value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled principal payments and partial loan paydowns. 

(2) Represents decrease in value associated with loans that paid off during the period. 

(3) Represents change in value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates. 

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Therefore, the fair value of MSRs is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of MSRs. MSR values are sensitive to movement in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which are impacted by the level of prepayments. 

A summary of key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR value to changes in these assumptions at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 follows: 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Decline in fair value due to Decline in fair value due to (dollar amounts in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change 

Constant prepayment rate (annualized) 

9.30 &#160; % $ ( 14 ) $ ( 28 ) 12.28 &#160; % $ ( 17 ) $ ( 32 ) Spread over forward interest rate swap rates 504 &#160; bps ( 8 ) ( 17 ) 466 &#160; bps ( 7 ) ( 13 ) 

Total servicing, late and other ancillary fees included in mortgage banking income was $ 22 million and $ 18 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans serviced for third parties was $ 31.6 billion and $ 31.0 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

7. BORROWINGS 

Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and were comprised of the following at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively: &#160;

Share Repurchases 

On July 21, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $ 800 million of common shares within the four quarter period from the third quarter of 2021 through the second quarter of 2022. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the 2022 first quarter, Huntington repurchased no shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2022, Huntington has completed $ 650 million of the current share repurchase authorization. 

Treasury shares 

Treasury shares includes shares held for deferred compensation plans, at cost, of $ 78 million at March 31, 2022 and $ 79 million at December 31, 2021. 

Non-controlling Interest in Subsidiaries 

Through the acquisition of TCF, Huntington acquired a joint venture in which Huntington maintains a 55 % ownership interest. As Huntington has a controlling financial interest, its financial results are consolidated in Huntington's financial statements and the other party&#8217;s 45 % ownership interest is reported as a non-controlling interest within equity.

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock) available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units and awards, and distributions from deferred compensation plans. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. 

The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: 

Three Months Ended March 31, (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data, share count in thousands) 2022 2021 Basic earnings per common share: Net income attributable to Huntington Bancshares Inc $ 460 &#160; $ 532 &#160; Preferred stock dividends 28 &#160; 31 &#160; Net income available to common shareholders $ 432 &#160; $ 501 &#160; Average common shares issued and outstanding 1,438,427 &#160; 1,017,512 &#160; Basic earnings per common share $ 0.30 &#160; $ 0.49 &#160; Diluted earnings per common share: Dilutive potential common shares: Stock options and restricted stock units and awards 19,629 &#160; 18,397 &#160; Shares held in deferred compensation plans 6,271 &#160; 5,094 &#160; Dilutive potential common shares 25,900 &#160; 23,491 &#160; Total diluted average common shares issued and outstanding 1,464,327 &#160; 1,041,003 &#160; Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.29 &#160; $ 0.48 &#160; Anti-dilutive awards (1) 2,148 &#160; 1,666 &#160; 

(1) Reflects the total number of shares related to outstanding options and awards that have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive. 

11. NONINTEREST INCOME 

Huntington earns a variety of revenue including interest and fees from customers as well as revenues from non-customers. Certain sources of revenue are recognized within interest or fee income and are outside of the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). Other sources of revenue fall within the scope of ASC 606 and are generally recognized within noninterest income. These revenues are included within various sections of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table shows Huntington&#8217;s total noninterest income segregated between contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606 and those within the scope of other GAAP Topics. 

(dollar amounts in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, Noninterest income 2022 2021 Noninterest income from contracts with customers $ 308 &#160; $ 222 &#160; Noninterest income within the scope of other GAAP topics 191 &#160; 173 &#160; Total noninterest income $ 499 &#160; $ 395 &#160;

Huntington generally provides services for customers in which it acts as principal. Payment terms and conditions vary amongst services and customers, and thus impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Some fees may be paid before any service is rendered and accordingly, such fees are deferred until the obligations pertaining to those fees are satisfied. Most Huntington contracts with customers are cancelable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended March 31, 2022 is expected to be earned within one year. Huntington does not have significant balances of contract assets or contract liabilities and any change in those balances during the reporting period ended March 31, 2022 was determined to be immaterial. 

12. FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

See Note 19 &#8220;Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

The following tables present a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3. The classification of an item as Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 measurements may also include observable components of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. The amounts presented represent the fair value on the various measurement dates throughout the period. The gains (losses) represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. 

The amounts measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows:

Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans held for investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. Periodically, in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized in the form of a charge-off.

(1) Certain disclosures related to quantitative level 3 fair value measurements do not include those deemed to be immaterial. 

The following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. 

Credit loss estimates, such as probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve. 

Discount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values. 

Net market price and pull through percentages generally increase when market interest rates increase and decline when market interest rates decline. Higher net market price and pull through percentages generally result in higher fair values.

(1) Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties. 

(2) Excludes securities without readily determinable fair values. 

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include trading account securities, customers&#8217; acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, FHLB advances, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in banks, interest-bearing deposits at FRB, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under resale agreements. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington&#8217;s exposure to changes in customer credit quality. Accordingly, their carrying values, which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates, are reasonable estimates of fair value. 

Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage servicing rights, deposit base, and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above. Accordingly, this fair value information is not intended to, and does not, represent Huntington&#8217;s underlying value. Many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates.

13. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or a liability (in other assets or other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value. 

Derivative financial instruments can be designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses on the hedging instruments in the income statement line item where the gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated in an effective hedge relationship under GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur. 

The following table presents the fair values and notional values of all derivative instruments included in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Amounts in the table below are presented gross without the impact of any net collateral arrangements.

Derivatives used in asset and liability management activities 

Huntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity, principally for asset and liability management purposes. Balance sheet hedging activity is generally arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment that can be classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are executed to hedge changes in fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Cash flow hedges are executed to modify interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. 

The following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments.

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. Adjustments to interest income were also recorded for the amounts related to the amortization of floors and forward-starting floors that were excluded from the hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of economic hedges, as well as the amounts related to terminated hedges reclassified from AOCI. The net amounts resulted in an increase to net interest income of $ 39 million and $ 225 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings and offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item. 

Huntington has designated $ 8.6 billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the last-of-layer method. This approach allows the Company to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value basis adjustment on our hedged mortgage-backed securities is included in available-for-sale securities on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Huntington has also designated $ 869 million of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate corporate bonds.

As of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges. 

Amortized Cost Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment To Hedged Items (dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Assets Investment securities (1) $ 18,364 &#160; $ 17,150 &#160; $ ( 547 ) $ ( 117 ) Liabilities Long-term debt (2) 3,237 &#160; 1,981 &#160; ( 54 ) 45 &#160; 

(1) Amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. As of March 31, 2022, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 16.5 billion, the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was $ 478 million, and the amounts of the designated hedging instruments were $ 8.6 billion. 

(2) Excluded from the above table are the cumulative amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining for long-term debt for which hedge accounting has been discontinued in the amounts of $ 12 million at March 31, 2022 and $ 17 million at December 31, 2021. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

At March 31, 2022, Huntington has $ 12.9 billion of interest rate floors, floor spreads and swaps. These are designated as cash flow hedges for variable rate commercial loans. The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in OCI and is reclassified into income when the hedged item impacts earnings. The initial premium paid for the interest rate floor contracts represents the time value of the contracts and is not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness. Any change in fair value related to time value is recognized in OCI. The initial premium paid is amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to interest income over the contractual life of these contracts. 

Gains and (losses) on interest rate floors, floor spreads, and swaps recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) after-tax were $( 240 ) million and $( 68 ) million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Derivatives used in mortgage banking activities 

Mortgage loan origination hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to economically hedging Huntington&#8217;s mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is committed or locked. Forward commitments to sell economically hedge the possible loss on interest rate lock commitments due to interest rate change. The net asset position of these derivatives at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $ 30 million and $ 15 million, respectively. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.1 billion, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year . 

MSR hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR asset and to mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR asset, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, TBA securities, Treasury futures contracts, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps. 

The notional value of the derivative financial instruments, the corresponding net asset (liability) position recognized in other assets and/or other liabilities, and net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging activity is summarized in the following table: 

(dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional value $ 1,050 &#160; $ 1,330 &#160; Trading assets &#8212; &#160; 19 &#160; Trading liabilities ( 24 ) &#8212; &#160; 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Trading gains $ ( 47 ) $ ( 46 ) 

MSR hedging trading assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Trading gains (losses) are included in mortgage banking income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Derivatives used in customer related activities 

Various derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consist of commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange contracts. Huntington enters into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities. 

The interest rate or price risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Foreign currency derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. Transactions are primarily in liquid currencies with Canadian dollars and Euros comprising a majority of all transactions. Commodity derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of various commodities. Hedging of energy-related products and base metals comprise the majority of these transactions.

The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were $ 42 million and $ 51 million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including offsetting derivatives, were $ 44.3 billion and $ 45.1 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Huntington&#8217;s credit risk from customer derivatives was $ 235 million and $ 551 million at the same dates, respectively. 

Financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 

Huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 12 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221;. 

Derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Additionally, collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and Huntington&#8217;s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups. 

Huntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties, and routinely exchanges cash and high quality securities collateral. Huntington enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment and risk management needs. These types of transactions generally are low dollar volume. Huntington enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties; however, collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties. 

In addition to the customer derivative credit exposure, aggregate credit risk associated with broker-dealer and bank derivative transactions, net of collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty, was $ 379 million and $ 44 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The credit risk associated with derivatives is calculated after considering master netting agreements. 

At March 31, 2022, Huntington pledged $ 209 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged $ 492 million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral. 

The following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Trust-Preferred Securities 

Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as such, are not consolidated within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3) Variable effective rate at March 31, 2022, based on three-month LIBOR + 1.40 %. 

Each issue of the junior subordinated debentures has an interest rate equal to the corresponding trust securities distribution rate. Huntington has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time-to-time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the related debentures. During any such extension period, distributions to the trust securities will also be deferred and Huntington&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will be restricted. Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to trust securities are guaranteed by Huntington to the extent of funds held by the trusts. The guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as the junior subordinated debt. The guarantee does not place a limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by Huntington. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 73 

Affordable Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. 

Huntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in other assets. Investments that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Investment losses are included in Other noninterest income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table presents the balances of Huntington&#8217;s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

Commitments to extend credit 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these financial agreements at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were as follows: 

(dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 

Contract amount representing credit risk 

Commitments to extend credit: 

Commercial 

$ 28,070 &#160; $ 27,933 &#160; Consumer 

19,659 &#160; 18,513 &#160; Commercial real estate 

3,078 &#160; 3,042 &#160; Standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds 695 &#160; 694 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 

58 &#160; 36 &#160; 

Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer&#8217;s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. Collateral to secure any funding of these commitments predominately consists of residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans. 

Standby letters-of-credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years . Since the conditions under which Huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize, the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was $ 11 million and $ 7 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Commercial letters-of-credit represent short-term, self-liquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days . The goods or cargo being traded normally secure these instruments. 

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings. 

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, Huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each matter may be. 

Huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. 

2022 1Q Form 10-Q 75 

For certain matters, Huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In cases in which Huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is $ 0 to $ 15 million at March 31, 2022 in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent Huntington&#8217;s maximum loss exposure. 

Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Huntington. Further, management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address Huntington&#8217;s contingent liabilities. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond Huntington&#8217;s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to Huntington&#8217;s results of operations for any particular reporting period. 

16. SEGMENT REPORTING 

Huntington&#8217;s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. The Company has four major business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. For a description of our business segments, see Note 25 - Segment Reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
