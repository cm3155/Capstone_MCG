EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation 

On June 9, 2021, Huntington closed the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation in an all-stock transaction valued at $7.2 billion. TCF was a financial holding company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan with operations across the Midwest. The acquisition added depth in existing markets and new markets for expansion and brings complimentary businesses together to drive synergies and growth. Historical periods prior to June 9, 2021 reflect results of legacy Huntington operations. Subsequent to closing, results reflect all post-acquisition activity. For further information, refer to Note 2 &#8220; Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Summary of 2021 Third Quarter Results Compared to 2020 Third Quarter 

For the quarter, we reported net income of $377 million, or $0.22 per common share, compared with $303 million, or $0.27 per common share, in the year-ago quarter. The reported net income benefited from a decline in provision for credit losses of $239 million and was impacted by TCF acquisition-related expenses totaling $234 million. After tax TCF acquisition-related expenses were $192 million or $(0.13) per common share. 

Net interest income was $1.2 billion, up $343 million, or 42% from the year-ago quarter. FTE net interest income was $1.2 billion, up $345 million, or 42%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit from the $48.7 billion, or 44%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 6 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 2.90%. Average earning asset growth included a $29.4 billion, or 36%, increase in average loans and leases and a $13.1 billion, or 57% increase in average securities, both of which were impacted by the TCF acquisition in June 2021. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 5 

The provision for credit losses decreased $239 million from the year-ago quarter to a benefit of $62 million in the 2021 third quarter. The decrease reflected the benefit from improvement in the macroeconomic scenarios. NCOs decreased $58 million from the year-ago-quarter to $55 million. Both commercial NCOs of $47 million and consumer NCOs of $8 million were down on a year-over-year basis. Total NCOs represented an annualized 0.20% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, down from 0.56% in the year-ago quarter. 

Noninterest income was $535 million, up $105 million, or 24%, and noninterest expense increased $577 million, or 81%, from the year ago quarter. The increases in both noninterest income and noninterest expense were primarily impacted by the acquisition of TCF. 

Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.57%, down from 9.89% a year ago. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.35% compared to 12.37% at September 30, 2020. The decrease in regulatory capital ratios was driven by the repurchase of 33.4 million common shares over the last three quarters, cash dividends, partially offset by earnings, adjusted for the CECL transition. The balance sheet growth as a result of the TCF acquisition was largely offset by the common stock issued related to the acquisition, net of goodwill and intangibles, as well as elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank (both of which are 0% risk weighted). The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios also reflect the issuance of $500 million of Series H preferred stock in the 2021 first quarter, the issuance of $175 million of Series I preferred stock in the 2021 second quarter resulting from the conversion of TCF preferred stock, partially offset by the redemption of $600 million of Series D preferred stock in the 2021 third quarter. Additionally, the total risk-based capital ratio reflects the issuance of $558 million of subordinated notes in the 2021 third quarter. 

On July 21, 2021, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $800 million of common shares within the next four quarters. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the 2021 third quarter, Huntington repurchased a total of $500 million of common stock, representing 33.4 million common shares, at a weighted average price of $14.96. 

Business Overview 

General 

Our general business objectives are: 

&#8226; Pursue consistent organic revenue and balance sheet growth. 

&#8226; Invest in our businesses, particularly technology and risk management. 

&#8226; Deliver positive long-term operating leverage. 

&#8226; Maintain an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. 

&#8226; Execute disciplined capital management. 

COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption that has affected daily living and has negatively impacted the economy. As further discussed in &#8220;Discussion of Results of Operations,&#8221; the volatility in the markets and lingering economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic continue to impact our performance. 

Huntington was able to react quickly to the changes required by the pandemic because of the commitment and flexibility of its workforce coupled with well-prepared business continuity plans. We continue to monitor the impact of the virus and evolving government guidelines. 

Throughout the pandemic, we have worked with our customers to originate and renew business loans as well as originate loans made available through the SBA PPP, a lending program established as part of the relief to American consumers and businesses in the CARES Act. Several subsequent congressional acts have reopened and extended the PPP loan program. During the 2021 third quarter, we continued to work with our customers who received PPP loan forgiveness. Through September 2021, $8.5 billion of the PPP loans have been forgiven by the SBA of the original $11.4 billion of PPP loans originated by both Huntington and TCF prior to acquisition. 

Uncertainty remains as to when there will be a return to historical norms of economic and social activity. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens due to various factors, including through the spread of more easily communicable variants of COVID-19, such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition.

Economy 

We continued to see increasing momentum in our business strategies during the quarter, delivering loan growth (excluding PPP) and fee income, including areas like wealth, capital markets, and cards and payments. Additionally, we continue to make strategic investments to drive sustained organic growth by dynamically managing expenses.

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 11 

2021 Third Quarter versus 2020 Third Quarter 

Net interest income for the 2021 third quarter increased $343 million, or 42%, from the 2020 third quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the 2021 third quarter increased $345 million, or 42%, from the 2020 third quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected a $48.7 billion, or 44%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 6 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 2.90%. Net interest income in the 2021 third quarter was impacted by the TCF acquisition, including purchase accounting net accretion, which favorably impacted the NIM by approximately 9 basis points, and also included $30 million of deferred PPP loan fees recognized upon receipt of forgiveness payments from the SBA, which favorably impacted the NIM by approximately 8 basis points. The year-over-year decreases in earning asset yields and average liability costs also reflected the impact of lower interest rates and changes in balance sheet mix, including elevated average deposits at the FRB. 

Average earning assets for the 2021 third quarter increased $48.7 billion, or 44%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting a $29.4 billion, or 36%, increase in average total loans and leases, a $13.1 billion, or 57%, increase in average securities and $5.7 billion, or 97%, increase in interest-bearing deposits at the FRB . The $29.4 billion, or 36%, increase in average total loans and leases was impacted by the TCF acquisition and robust portfolio mortgage production, partially offset by a decrease in average PPP loans. Average securities increased $13.1 billion, or 57%, primarily due to the TCF acquisition and the purchase of securities to deploy excess liquidity. 

Average total interest-bearing liabilities for the 2021 third quarter increased $28.5 billion, or 37%, from the year-ago quarter. Average total deposits increased $47.3 billion, or 50%, while average total core deposits increased $47.1 billion, or 52%. Increases across categories reflect the impact of the TCF acquisition, t he increase in average total deposits was additionally driven by elevated balances in core deposits largely related to residual government stimulus balances and improved retention. Specifically within core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $29.0 billion, or 57%, average savings and other domestic deposits increased $9.8 billion, or 88%, average money market deposits increased $7.1 billion, or 27%, and average core CDs increased $1.3 billion, or 63%. The increase in average core CDs due to the acquisition of TCF was partially offset by the maturity of balances related to the 2018 consumer deposit growth initiatives. Average total debt decreased $1.6 billion, or 17%, primarily reflecting the repayment and maturity of long-term debt over the past five quarters due to the strong core deposit growth, partially offset by $2.8 billion of debt assumed in the TCF acquisition. 

2021 Third Quarter versus 2021 Second Quarter 

Net interest income increased $322 million, or 38%, compared to the 2021 second quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased $323 million, or 38%, compared to the 2021 second quarter, reflecting a $32.0 billion, or 25% increase in average earning assets and a 24 basis point increase in the FTE net interest margin. Net interest income for the 2021 third quarter included a full-quarter impact from the TCF acquisition, compared to the partial quarter impact to the 2021 second quarter. The NIM increase reflected the negative $55 million, or a 17 basis point, 2021 second quarter mark-to-market of interest rate caps and a $26 million, or a 6 basis point, third quarter 2021 increase in purchase accounting net accretion from the TCF acquisition, partially offset by larger average deposit balances at the FRB. The interest rate caps were exited in the 2021 second quarter. Accelerated recognition of deferred PPP loan fees were $30 million in both the 2021 third quarter and 2021 second quarter. 

Average earning assets increased $32.0 billion, or 25%, primarily reflecting a $22.5 billion, or 26%, increase in average loans and leases and a $5.2 billion, or 17%, increase in average securities. Average balances across earning assets categories reflect the full-quarter impact from the TCF acquisition. The increase in average loan and lease growth was partially offset by the reduction of PPP loans due to forgiveness. Additionally, the increase in average securities reflected the purchase of securities to deploy excess liquidity. 

Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $20.4 billion, or 24%, when compared to the 2021 second quarter. Average total deposits increased $29.6 billion, or 26%, and average total core deposits increased $28.4 billion, or 26%. The increase in average total interest-bearing liabilities and deposits was primarily due to the full-quarter impact from the TCF acquisition. Specifically, within core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $16.0 billion, or 25%.

2021 First Nine Months versus 2020 First Nine Months 

Net interest income for the first nine-month period of 2021 increased $571 million, or 24%. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first nine-month period of 2021 increased $574 million, or 24%. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit of a $26.6 billion, or 25%, increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 2 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin. The increase in average total earning assets included a $13.8 billion, or 18%, increase in average loans and leases and a $7.2 billion, or 30%, increase in average securities. Average balances across earning assets categories reflect the late second-quarter 2021 TCF acquisition. The increase in average loans and leases additionally includes an increase in average PPP loans and average securities additionally reflected the purchase of securities to deploy excess liquidity. Average earning asset yields decreased 44 basis points due to lower interest rates on loans (down 17 basis points), a decline in securities yields and elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. Average funding costs decreased 58 basis points, primarily driven by lower cost of interest-bearing deposits (down 32 basis points) and the impact of the mark-to-market of interest rate caps (benefit of 9 basis points). The benefit from noninterest-bearing funding declined 16 basis points. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Credit Risk &#8221; section.) 

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. 

The provision for credit losses for the 2021 third quarter was a benefit of $62 million, a decrease of $239 million, or 135%, compared to the 2020 third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, provision for credit losses for the first nine-month period of 2021 was $89 million, a decrease of $856 million, or 91%, compared to the year-ago period. The reduction in provision expense over the prior year quarter was primarily attributed to the improvement in the macroeconomic scenarios resulting primarily from lower forecasted unemployment. The reduction in provision expense over prior year-to-date was primarily attributed to the improvement in the macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $294 million ($234 million from non-PCD loans and leases and $60 million from acquired unfunded lending commitments).

2021 Third Quarter versus 2021 Second Quarter 

Compared to the 2021 second quarter, total noninterest income increased $91 million, or 20%. Leasing revenue increased $30 million, primarily reflecting TCF&#8217;s leasing activities following the acquisition. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $26 million, or 30%, due primarily to the first full-quarter addition of TCF customers prior to the conversion to Huntington&#8217;s product and service set. Card and payment processing income increased $16 million, or 20%, primarily reflecting higher interchange income as a result of the TCF acquisition. Mortgage banking income increased $14 million, or 21%, primarily reflecting an increase in secondary marketing spreads and an increase in salable mortgage originations due to a full-quarter of volume added from the TCF acquisition. Other noninterest income increased $7 million, or 13%, primarily reflecting purchase accounting accretion from acquired unfunded loan commitments and a $6 million gain from branch divestitures. Partially offsetting these increases, gains on sales of securities decreased $10 million, reflecting securities portfolio optimization in the 2021 second quarter.

Noninterest income for the first nine-month period of 2021 increased $192 million, or 16%, from the year-ago period. The first nine-month period of 2021 noninterest income across categories was impacted by the June 2021 acquisition of TCF. Card and payment processing income increased $58 million, or 32%, primarily reflecting higher interchange income resulting from the TCF acquisition in addition to reduced customer activity as a result of the pandemic stay-at-home orders in the beginning of the prior year period. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $48 million, or 22%, primarily due to the impact of the addition of TCF customers prior to the conversion to Huntington&#8217;s product and service set, in addition to prior year period reflected pandemic-related fee waivers occurring through June. Leasing revenue increased $44 million primarily reflecting the addition of TCF&#8217;s portfolio of products. Other noninterest income increased $37 million, or 36%, primarily reflecting increased mezzanine investment income, increased amortization of upfront card-related contract renewal fees, purchase accounting accretion from acquired unfunded loan commitments and a $6 million gain from branch divestiture, partially offset by the prior year period gain on the annuitization of a retiree health plan. Trust and investment management services increased $29 million, or 21%, primarily reflecting higher sales production and overall market performance. Net gains (losses) on sales of securities increased $11 million, reflecting securities portfolio optimization. These increases were offset by a decrease in mortgage banking of $29 million, or 10%, primarily reflecting decreased spreads on salable originations, partially offset by an increase in volume added from the TCF acquisition, and a $22 million decrease in gain on sale of loans reflecting lower SBA loan sales resulting from the strategic decision to retain SBA loans on the balance sheet.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes in the 2021 third quarter was $90 million, compared with $55 million in the 2020 third quarter and $14 million in the 2021 second quarter. The provision for income taxes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 was $206 million and $96 million, respectively. All periods included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, general business credits, investments in qualified affordable housing projects, and capital losses. The effective tax rates for the 2021 third quarter, 2020 third quarter, and 2021 second quarter were 19.0%, 15.2%, and (2,353.3)%, respectively. Excluding TCF acquisition-related expenses of $269 million, the related tax benefit of $51 million and discrete tax expenses of $16 million, the effective tax rate in the 2021 second quarter would have been 18.8%. The effective tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 were 18.7% and 16.0%, respectively. The variance between the 2021 third quarter compared to the 2020 third quarter, and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 in the provision for income taxes and effective tax rates relates primarily to higher pre-tax income, discrete tax expenses and the impact of stock-based compensation. The net federal deferred tax liability was $151 million and the net state deferred tax asset was $20 million at September 30, 2021. 

We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009. The 2010 and 2011 tax years remain under exam by the IRS. While the statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2012 through 2019, the IRS has advised that tax years 2012 through 2014 will not be audited and is currently examining the 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. Also, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2016. 

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL 

We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the Board of Directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle. Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access management, and authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. 

We believe that our primary risk exposures are credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance. More information on risk can be found in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The MD&#38;A included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with this MD&#38;A as this discussion provides only material updates to the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&#38;A should also be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , and other information contained in this report. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios (see Note 3 &#8220; Investment Securities and Other Securities &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and collars, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 19 

We focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our ongoing expansion of portfolio management resources is central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.

Our loan portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. C&#38;I lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified portfolio level concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation.

Credit Quality 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 4 &#8220; Loans / Leases &#8221; and Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, TDRs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance. 

Credit quality performance in the 2021 third quarter reflected total NCOs as a percent of average loans, annualized, of 0.20%, down from 0.28% in the prior quarter. Total NCOs were $55 million, a decrease of $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by a $12 million decrease in Commercial NCOs, partially offset by a $5 million increase in Consumer NCOs. NPAs decreased from the prior quarter by $121 million, or 12%, largely driven by decreases in the C&#38;I and residential mortgage portfolios.

NPAs and NALs 

Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $657 million of commercial related NALs at September 30, 2021, $421 million, or 64%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. 

The following table reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail.

Total NPAs increased $330 million, or 59%, compared with December 31, 2020, largely driven by the TCF acquisition. 

TDR Loans 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 &#8220; Loans / Leases &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and TDR Loans section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.) 

Over the past five quarters, the accruing component of the total TDR balance has been consistently over 75%, indicating there is no identified credit loss and the borrowers continue to make their monthly payments. As of September 30, 2021, over 80% of the $407 million of accruing TDRs secured by residential real estate (residential mortgage and home equity in Table 12) are current on their required payments, with over 59% of the accruing pool having had no delinquency in the past 12 months. There is limited migration from the accruing to nonaccruing components, and virtually all of the charge-offs come from the nonaccruing TDR balances. 

TDRs identified by TCF prior to acquisition date are not included in our TDR disclosures as all such loans and leases were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent modifications are evaluated for potential treatment as TDRs in accordance with Huntington&#8217;s accounting policies.

(1) Loan modifications under the CARES Act, as amended and interagency regulatory guidance are not considered TDRs. 

Overall TDRs decreased $150 million, compared with December 31, 2020, with declines in all portfolios with the exception of RV and marine. Huntington continues to proactively work with our borrowing relationships that require assistance. The resulting loan structures enable our borrowers to meet their commitments and Huntington to retain earning assets. The accruing TDRs meet the well secured definition and have demonstrated a period of satisfactory payment performance. 

ACL 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Our ACL is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. 

The models used within our loan and lease portfolio incorporate historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to generate a loss rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses. 

We use a combination of statistically-based models that utilize assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key parameters: PD, EAD, and LGD. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period (two to three years), the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario. 

These three parameters, PD, EAD, and LGD are utilized to estimate the cumulative credit losses over the remaining expected life of the loan. We also consider the likelihood a previously charged-off account will be recovered. This calculation is dependent on how long ago the account was charged-off and future economic conditions, which estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery. Our models are developed using internal historical loss experience covering the full economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 23 

Future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the appropriate committee governance channels discussed below. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain geography based variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period. Any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management. Additionally, we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios. Lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics, risk ratings, origination credit bureau scores, delinquency status, and remaining months within loan agreements, among other factors. 

The macroeconomic scenarios evaluated by Huntington during the 2021 third quarter continued to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The baseline scenario used for the quarter assumes that the worst of the economic disruption from the pandemic has passed, with the expectation that subsequent waves of the virus will not carry the same level of economic disruption experienced to date. The unemployment variable is incorporated within our models as both a rate of change variable and an absolute level variable. Historically, changes in unemployment have taken gradual paths resulting in more measured impacts each quarter. 

The table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of these key macroeconomic variables has changed since the end of 2020: 

Table 13 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables Baseline scenario forecast 2020 2021 2022 Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Unemployment rate (1) 4Q 2020 7.2 % 7.5 % 7.2 % 6.4 % 5.5 % 1Q 2021 N/A 6.3 5.7 5.0 4.5 2Q 2021 N/A 5.9 4.5 3.7 3.5 3Q 2021 N/A N/A 4.6 3.7 3.5 Gross Domestic Product (1) 4Q 2020 3.0 % 3.8 % 5.8 % 4.4 % 3.9 % 1Q 2021 N/A 5.2 5.8 5.3 3.5 2Q 2021 N/A 10.6 6.5 2.7 1.9 3Q2021 N/A N/A 6.4 2.4 1.9 (1) Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts. 

Management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Management considered multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to capture the severity of and the economic disruption associated with the pandemic. While we have incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19 into our ACL, the ultimate impact remains uncertain, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. 

Given significant COVID-19 specific government relief programs established during 2020 and additional stimulus spending enacted into law during 2021, management developed additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our governance committees reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transactional reserve (collectively assessed) will continue to utilize the scenario weighting approach established in prior quarters. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the September 30, 2021 ACL included a material general reserve component as well as additional industry specific risk profiles, including profiles related to the commercial real estate portfolio, to capture economic uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

24 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Our ACL methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date. The loss modeling process uses an EAD concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments, where appropriate. Losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as AULC within other liabilities in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. A liability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized if Huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable. 

The table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan categories.

(1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases. 

2021 Third Quarter versus 2020 Fourth Quarter 

At September 30, 2021, the ALLL was $2.1 billion, an increase of $293 million compared to the December 31, 2020 balance of $1.8 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition. The ALLL to total loans and leases ratio decreased 31 basis points to 1.91%. 

The ACL to total loans and leases ratio was 1.99% at September 30, 2021 compared to 2.29% at December 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects an improvement in the economic outlook.

NCOs decreased $156 million in the first nine-month period of 2021 to $181 million. The decrease was evident across both the commercial and consumer portfolios. The commercial decrease was primarily a function of elevated losses associated within the oil and gas portfolio in 2020, while the consumer decrease was broad based due to positive portfolio performance throughout 2021. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 27 

Market Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going market risk management processes.) 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. 

Huntington measures market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition, and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business. 

In measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in Huntington&#8217;s balance sheet, Huntington compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios which are instantaneous parallel rate shifts, and &#8220;ramp&#8221; scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, Huntington presumes that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon. 

Table 17 - Net Interest Income at Risk &#160; Net Interest Income at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -25 +100 +200 Board policy limits -1.3 % -2.0 % -4.0 % September 30, 2021 -1.9 4.0 8.2 December 31, 2020 -1.1 3.4 7.3 

The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual (&#8220;ramp&#8221; as defined above) +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months as well as an instantaneous parallel shock of -25 basis points. 

Huntington&#8217;s NII at Risk is within the Board of Directors&#8217; policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. NII at Risk was operating outside the Board of Directors&#8217; policy limit for the -25 basis point scenario at September 30, 2021. This breach was escalated to the Board of Directors&#8217; ROC. On October 19, 2021, as part of our annual Corporate Risk Appetite review process, the ROC reviewed all established limits and determined an update to the limit was appropriate. The ROC approved an increase to the -25 basis point policy limit bringing this metric back into compliance. 

The NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The change in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in market rate expectations, and the size and mix of the balance sheet.

The EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts (&#8220;shocks&#8221; as defined above) in market interest rates. 

Huntington is within the Board of Directors&#8217; policy limits for the -25, +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. As of September 30, 2021, EVE depicts a liability sensitive (long duration) balance sheet profile. The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2020&#8217;s asset sensitive (short duration) position was driven primarily by changes in the spot market rate curve impacting forecasted runoff expectations, and the size and composition of the balance sheet as a result of the TCF acquisition. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps. 

Table 19 shows all swap, and cap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 &#8220; Derivative Financial Instruments &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following table presents additional information about the interest rate swaps, and caps and floors used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Net interest income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 included a positive $89 million mark-to-market of interest rate caps. The mark-to-market is not included in the NII at Risk calculations above. The interest rate caps were terminated in the 2021 second quarter and were replaced with $4.0 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting. 

MSRs 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 &#8220; Mortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights &#8221; of Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .) 

At September 30, 2021, we had a total of $338 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $30.6 billion in mortgage loans. 

MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. 

MSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Price Risk 

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held. 

Liquidity Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going liquidity risk management processes.) 

Our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base. Core deposits comprised approximately 97% of total deposits at September 30, 2021. We also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity, including advances from the FHLB, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and certificates of deposit issued through brokers. Liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $14.8 billion as of September 30, 2021. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are retail and commercial core deposits. At September 30, 2021, these core deposits funded 79% of total assets (124% of total loans). Other sources of liquidity include non-core deposits, FHLB advances, wholesale debt instruments, and securitizations. Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $29 million and $14 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(1) Includes consumer certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more. 

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. Total loans and securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and the FHLB are $56.2 billion and $53.4 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

At September 30, 2021, the market value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, and security repurchase agreements totaled $6.4 billion. There were no securities of a single issuer, which are not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at September 30, 2021. 

To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding, asset securitization or sale. Sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, negotiable CDs, brokered and other deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. At September 30, 2021, total wholesale funding was $12.6 billion, a decrease from $12.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease from year-end is primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt. 

At September 30, 2021, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company&#8217;s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. 

During the 2021 first quarter, Huntington issued $500 million of Series H Preferred Stock. On June 9, 2021, each share of TCF&#8217;s Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock was converted into a share of a Series I Preferred Stock of Huntington having substantially the same terms as TCF&#8217;s preferred stock. See Note 10 &#8220; Shareholders&#8217; Equity &#8221; and Note 14 appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the parent company had $3.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. 

32 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

On October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.155 per common share. The dividend is payable on January 3, 2022, to shareholders of record on December 17, 2021. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.155 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $224 million per quarter. Additionally, on October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G and Series H Preferred Stock dividend payable on January 18, 2022 to shareholders of record on January 1, 2022. On September 15, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I Preferred Stock payable on December 1, 2021 to shareholders of record on November 15, 2021. Total cash demands required for Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I are expected to be approximately $28 million per quarter. 

During the first nine months of 2021, the Bank paid preferred and common dividends of $34 million and $875 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities from time to time. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, floors and caps, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. 

We actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats have increased, primarily through phishing campaigns. We are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns. We have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce is now working remotely. 

Our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our board-level Technology Committee, as appropriate. As a complement to the overall cyber security risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 33 

To mitigate operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Significant findings or issues are escalated by the Third Party Risk Management Committee to the Technology Committee of the Board, as appropriate. 

The TCF integration is inherently large and complex. Our objective for managing execution risk is to minimize impact to daily operations. We have an established Integration Management Office led by senior management. Responsibilities include central management, reporting, and escalation of key integration deliverables. In addition, a separate Board Committee, the Integration Oversight Committee, is in place to assist in the oversight and to monitor the integration activities, risks and progress of the TCF acquisition. 

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance. 

Compliance Risk 

Financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. 

Capital 

Both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the Company&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are adequate. 

34 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

The following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and Bank levels for each of the periods presented: 

Table 21 - Regulatory Capital Data (1) &#160; &#160; Basel III (dollar amounts in millions) &#160; September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Total risk-weighted assets Consolidated $ 128,023 $ 88,878 Bank 127,537 88,601 CET 1 risk-based capital Consolidated 12,250 8,887 Bank 13,284 9,438 Tier 1 risk-based capital Consolidated 14,531 11,083 Bank 14,466 10,601 Tier 2 risk-based capital Consolidated 2,842 1,774 Bank 1,996 1,431 Total risk-based capital Consolidated 17,373 12,856 Bank 16,462 12,032 CET 1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 9.57 % 10.00 % Bank 10.42 10.65 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 11.35 12.47 Bank 11.34 11.97 Total risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 13.57 14.46 Bank 12.91 13.58 Tier 1 leverage ratio Consolidated 8.62 9.32 Bank 8.60 8.94 

(1) Capital ratios reflect Huntington's election of a five-year transition of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The CECL transition amount includes the impact of Huntington&#8217;s adoption of the new CECL accounting standards on January 1, 2020 and 25% for the cumulative change in the reported ACL since adopting CECL, excluding the allowance established at acquisition for purchased credit deteriorated loans. 

At September 30, 2021, we maintained Basel III capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the FRB. The decrease in regulatory capital ratios was driven by the repurchase of 33.4 million common shares over the last three quarters, cash dividends, partially offset by earnings, adjusted for the CECL transition. The balance sheet growth as a result of the TCF acquisition was largely offset by the common stock issued related to the acquisition, net of goodwill and other intangibles, as well as elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank (both of which are 0% risk weighted). The change in regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios for the first nine-month period of 2021 reflects the issuance of $500 million of Series H preferred stock in the 2021 first quarter, the issuance of $175 million of Series I preferred stock in the 2021 second quarter resulting from the conversion of TCF preferred stock, partially offset by the redemption of $600 million of Series D preferred stock in the 2021 third quarter, which represented all of the Series D preferred stock issued and outstanding. Additionally, the total risk-based capital ratio reflects the issuance of $558 million of subordinated notes in the 2021 third quarter. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

We generate shareholders&#8217; equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders&#8217; equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $19.5 billion at September 30, 2021, an increase of $6.5 billion or 50% when compared with December 31, 2020. 

On February 2, 2021, Huntington issued $500 million of preferred stock. Huntington issued 20,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 4.50% Series H Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Preferred H Stock), par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 35 

On June 9, 2021, each share of TCF Financial Corporation 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, outstanding immediately prior to acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation was converted into the right to receive a share of the newly created Huntington 5.70% Series I Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. 

On July 15, 2021, all 24,000,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Huntington&#8217;s 6.250% Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, were redeemed. 

Subsequent to quarter end, all 4,000,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Huntington&#8217;s 5.875% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, were redeemed. 

On June 24, 2021, we were notified by the FRB that Huntington&#8217;s stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement would not be recalculated and that beginning on July 1, 2021, Huntington was authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the FRB&#8217;s capital rule, inclusive of the final SCB requirement of 2.5% provided to Huntington on August 7, 2020. In addition, the FRB notified us that our preliminary SCB effective for the period October 1, 2021, until September 30, 2022 would remain at 2.5%, which is the minimum under the stress capital buffer framework. 

Dividends 

We consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. Our strong capital position us to take advantage of additional capital management opportunities. 

Share Repurchases 

From time to time, the Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board of Directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. 

On July 21, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of common shares over the next four quarters. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the 2021 third quarter, Huntington repurchased a total of $500 million of common stock, representing 33.4 million common shares, at a weighted average price of $14.96. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION 

Overview 

Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. We have four major business segments: Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. 

Business segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. 

Revenue Sharing 

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. 

36 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Expense Allocation 

The management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related net expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) 

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities). 

Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment 

Net income (loss) by business segment for the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is presented in the following table: 

Table 22 - Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment &#160; Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Consumer and Business Banking $ 231 $ 249 Commercial Banking 446 (45) Vehicle Finance 243 81 RBHPCG 47 60 Treasury / Other (73) 156 Net income $ 894 $ 501 

Treasury / Other 

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives (including the mark-to-market of interest rate caps), and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. 

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity as well as the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain TCF acquisition-related expenses in the current period, certain corporate administrative, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower.

2021 First Nine Months versus 2020 First Nine Months 

Consumer and Business Banking, including Home Lending, reported net income of $231 million in the first nine-month period of 2021, a decrease of $18 million, or 7%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $88 million, or 8%, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition and PPP revenue, partially offset by decreased spread on deposits and decreased loan margin. The provision for credit losses decreased $143 million, or 72%, primarily due to changes in the forecasted economic outlook compared to the year-ago period, partially offset by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses. Noninterest income increased $76 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher interchange income and service charge income resulting from the TCF acquisition in addition to reduced customer activity and fee-waivers as a result of the pandemic in the beginning of the prior year period and a $6 million gain from branch divestitures, partially offset by decreased mortgage banking income. Noninterest expense increased $329 million, or 26%, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition, in addition to increased allocated expense and personnel costs due to higher levels of production and origination volume. 

Home Lending, an operating unit of Consumer and Business Banking, reflects the result of the origination, sale, and servicing of mortgage loans less referral fees and net interest income for mortgage banking products distributed by the retail branch network and other business segments. Home Lending reported net income of $19 million in the first nine-month period of 2021, compared with net income of $75 million in the year-ago period. Noninterest income decreased $63 million, driven primarily by decreased spreads on salable originations, partially offset by higher salable originations. Noninterest expense increased $41 million due to primarily due to higher personnel expense as a result of the TCF acquisition and higher origination volumes.

2021 First Nine Months versus 2020 First Nine Months 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $446 million in the first nine-month period of 2021, compared to a net loss of $45 million in the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $180 million, or 26%, primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, an increase in average PPP loans, and a 2 basis point increase in net interest margin driven by an increase in loan spread as the benefit from purchase accounting net accretion was partially offset by declines in yields. Partially offsetting these benefits was the impact of the continued decline in the benefit of deposits. The provision for credit losses decreased $504 million, or 82%, primarily due to changes in the forecasted economic outlook compared to the year-ago period, partially offset by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses. Noninterest income increased $92 million, or 35%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition, purchase accounting accretion from acquired unfunded loan commitments, and an increase in equipment finance revenue reflecting higher gains on terminations and sales. Noninterest expense increased $153 million, or 38%, primarily due to higher personnel expense and lease financing equipment depreciation as a result of the TCF acquisition.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. 

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis 

Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent. We encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 41 

Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; Tangible equity to tangible assets, and 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel III definitions. 

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 

Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company&#8217;s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Risk Factors 

More information on risk can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors below and in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion of this report. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL at September 30, 2021 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate. 

42 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around new infections and COVID-19 deaths rising again. Additionally, consumer confidence falls with the resulting drop in consumer spending sending the economy back into recession in fourth quarter 2021. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases once more and remains elevated for a prolonged period, the rate is estimated at 9.1% and 6.9% at the end of 2022 and 2023 respectively. These numbers represent 5.6% and 3.4% higher unemployment estimates than baseline scenario projections of 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively for the same time periods. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at September 30, 2021, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and a 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $700 million at September 30, 2021. 

The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The highly uncertain economic environment; 

&#8226; The difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework. 

We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. For more information, see Note 4 &#8220; Loans and Leases &#8221; and Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Acquisition Method of Accounting 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This method often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Acquisition-related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. The acquisition method of accounting does allow for a measurement period to make adjustments to acquisition accounting for up to one year after the acquisition date, for new information that existed at the acquisition date but may not have been known or available at that time. For further information, refer to Note 2 &#8220; Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 43 

Fair Value Measurement 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including securities, and derivative instruments. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions, adjustments and judgment including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, cash flows, default rates, loss rates, terminal values and liquidation values. A significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value, which in turn, may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. 

In addition to the above mentioned on-going fair value measurements, fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other non-recurring financial assets and liabilities. At June 9, 2021, approximately $46 billion of our assets and $43 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value as a result of applying the acquisition method of accounting. 

The fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available. Our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2 in fair value hierarchy), when available. The level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value. The fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy, additional discussion regarding fair value measurements, and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs, can be found in Note 13 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Acquisitions typically result in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life, which is also subjective. Customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets, including but not limited to, customer deposit intangibles.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Huntington reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position, the results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include descriptions of significant accounting policies, as updated by the information contained in this report, should be read in conjunction with these interim financial statements. 

For statement of cash flow purposes, cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits at Federal Reserve Bank. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year&#8217;s presentation. 

In conjunction with applicable accounting standards, all material subsequent events have been either recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosed in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2. ACQUISITION OF TCF FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

On June 9, 2021, Huntington closed the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation in an all-stock transaction valued at $ 7.2 billion. TCF was a financial holding company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan with operations across the Midwest. The acquisition added depth in existing markets and new markets for expansion and brings complimentary businesses together to drive synergies and growth. 

Under the terms of the agreement, TCF shareholders received 3.0028 shares of Huntington common stock for each share of TCF common stock. Holders of TCF common stock also received cash in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, each outstanding share of 5.70 % Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of TCF was converted into one share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Huntington, Series I Preferred Stock. 

The acquisition of TCF has been accounted for as a business combination. We recorded the estimate of fair value based on initial valuations available at June 9, 2021. We continue to review these valuations and certain of these estimated fair values are considered preliminary as of September 30, 2021, and subject to adjustment for up to one year after June 9, 2021. While we believe that the information available on June 9, 2021 provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, we expect that we may obtain additional information and evidence during the measurement period that would result in changes to the estimated fair value amounts. Valuations subject to change include, but are not limited to, loans and leases, certain deposits, deferred tax assets and liabilities and certain other assets and other liabilities.

Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in banks: The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. 

Securities: Fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar instruments, quoted market prices that are not in an active market or other inputs that are observable in the market. In the absence of observable inputs, fair value is estimated based on pricing models and/or discounted cash flow methodologies. 

Loans and leases: Fair values for loans and leases are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and lease and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term, amortization status and current discount rates. Loans and leases are grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used for loans and leases are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. 

CDI: This intangible asset represents the low cost of funding acquired core deposits provide relative to the Company&#8217;s marginal cost of funds. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternative cost of funds, and the interest costs associated with customer deposits. The CDI is being amortized over 10 years based upon the period over which estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received. 

Deposits: The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the acquisition date. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

Debt: The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 

Premises and equipment: The fair values of premises are based on a market approach, with Huntington obtaining third-party appraisals and broker opinions of value for land, office and branch space. 

Servicing rights: Servicing rights are valued using an option-adjusted spread valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, prepayment rates, delinquency rates, contractually specified servicing fees, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. 

PCD loans and leases 

Purchased loans and leases that reflect a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit from origination are considered PCD. For PCD loans and leases, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is recognized in the ALLL on the date of acquisition using the same methodology as other loans and leases held-for-investment. The following table provides a summary of loans and leases purchased as part of the TCF acquisition with credit deterioration at acquisition: 

(dollar amounts in millions) Commercial Consumer Total Par value (UPB) $ 7,931 &#160; $ 1,333 &#160; $ 9,264 &#160; ALLL at acquisition ( 374 ) ( 58 ) ( 432 ) Non-credit (discount) ( 219 ) ( 68 ) ( 287 ) Fair value $ 7,338 &#160; $ 1,207 &#160; $ 8,545 &#160;

Huntington's operating results for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2021 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of TCF Financial Corporation subsequent to the acquisition on June 9, 2021. Due to the various conversions of TCF systems during the second quarter 2021, as well as other streamlining and integration of the operating activities into those of the Company, historical reporting for the former TCF operations is impracticable and thus disclosures of the revenue from the assets acquired and income before income taxes is impracticable for the period subsequent to acquisition. 

The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the acquisition of TCF had occurred on January 1, 2020 under the &#8220;Unaudited Pro Forma&#8221; columns. The pro forma adjustments give effect to any change in interest income due to the accretion of the discount (premium) associated with the fair value adjustments to acquired loans and leases, any change in interest expense due to estimated premium amortization/discount accretion associated with the fair value adjustment to acquired interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt and the amortization of the CDI that would have resulted had the deposits been acquired as of January 1, 2020. Pro forma results include Huntington acquisition-related expenses which primarily included, but were not limited to, severance costs, professional services, data processing fees, marketing and advertising expenses totaling $ 234 million and $ 524 million for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Pro forma results also include adjustments for the elimination of TCF&#8217;s accretion of the discount (premium) associated with the fair value adjustments to acquired loans and leases, deposits and long-term debt, elimination of TCF's intangible amortization expense, and related income tax effects. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred had Huntington acquired TCF on January 1, 2020. Furthermore, cost savings and other business synergies related to the acquisition are not reflected in the pro forma amounts.

Branch divestiture: In September 2021, Huntington completed the divestiture of 14 branches acquired in the acquisition of TCF and certain related assets and deposit liabilities to Horizon Bank, to satisfy regulatory requirements in connection with the acquisition. Total deposits and loans that were divested to Horizon Bank for the transaction were $ 847 million and $ 209 million, respectively.

During the 2021 second quarter, Huntington transferred $ 3.0 billion of securities from the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio. At the time of the transfer, AOCI included $ 2 million of unrealized gains attributed to these securities. This gain will be amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the securities. 

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, security repurchase agreements and to support borrowing capacity totaled $ 23.2 billion and $ 14.4 billion, respectively. There were no securities of a single issuer, which were not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at either September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020. At September 30, 2021, all HTM debt securities are considered AAA rated. In addition, there were no HTM debt securities considered past due at September 30, 2021. 

AFS Securities Impairment/HTM Securities Allowance for Credit Losses 

Based on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability, Huntington has concluded that it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio. As such, no allowance or impairment is recorded with respect to securities as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1) Loans and leases are reported at principal amount outstanding including unamortized purchase premiums and discounts, unearned income, and net direct fees and costs associated with originating and acquiring loans and leases. The aggregate amount of these loan and lease adjustments was a net (discount) premium of $( 85 ) million and $ 171 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

(2) The total amount of accrued interest recorded for these loans and leases at September 30, 2021, was $ 146 million and $ 143 million of commercial and consumer loan and lease portfolios, respectively, and at December 31, 2020, was $ 146 million and $ 123 million of commercial and consumer loan and lease portfolios, respectively. Accrued interest is presented in other assets within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet s. 

Lease Financing 

Huntington leases equipment to customers, and substantially all such arrangements are classified as either sales-type or direct financing leases, which are included in commercial loans and leases. These leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income, and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases. 

Huntington assesses net investments in leases (including residual values) for impairment and recognizes any impairment losses in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investments in leases may be reduced by an ACL, with changes recognized as provision expense. 

The following table presents net investments in lease financing receivables by category at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Lease payments receivable $ 4,622 &#160; $ 1,737 &#160; Estimated residual value of leased assets 781 &#160; 664 &#160; Gross investment in lease financing receivables 5,403 &#160; 2,401 &#160; Deferred origination costs 24 &#160; 21 &#160; Deferred fees, unearned income and other ( 436 ) ( 200 ) Total lease financing receivables $ 4,991 &#160; $ 2,222 &#160; 

The carrying value of residual values guaranteed was $ 463 million and $ 93 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The future lease rental payments due from customers on sales-type and direct financing leases at September 30, 2021, totaled $ 4.6 billion and were due as follows: $ 0.8 billion in 2021, $ 0.8 billion in 2022, $ 0.8 billion in 2023, $ 0.8 billion in 2024, $ 0.7 billion in 2025, and $ 0.7 billion thereafter. Interest income recognized for these types of leases was $ 73 million and $ 26 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, interest income recognized was $ 154 million and $ 81 million, respectively.

Credit Quality Indicators 

See Note 5 &#8220;Loans/Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the credit quality indicators Huntington utilizes for monitoring credit quality and for determining an appropriate ACL level. 

To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality for commercial loans, and for purposes of determining an appropriate ACL level for these loans, Huntington utilizes the following internally defined categories of credit grades: 

&#8226; Pass - Higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 

&#8226; OLEM - The credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect Huntington&#8217;s position in the future. For these reasons, Huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Substandard - Inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, equity, and/or the collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. It is likely Huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated. 

&#8226; Doubtful - Loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high. 

Loans are generally assigned a category of &#8220; Pass &#8221; rating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrower&#8217;s financial performance. 

Commercial loans categorized as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are considered Criticized loans. Commercial loans categorized as Substandard or Doubtful are both considered Classified loans. 

For all classes within the consumer loan portfolios, loans are assigned pool level PD factors based on the FICO range within which the borrower&#8217;s credit bureau score falls. A credit bureau score is a credit score developed by FICO based on data provided by the credit bureaus. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher the credit bureau score, the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore, an indicator of higher credit quality. 

Huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics. The classifications described above, and also presented in the table below, represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes.

TDR Loans 

TDRs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered TDRs when the concessions provided would not otherwise be considered. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. See Note 5 &#8220;Loans / Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of TDRs. 

The following table presents, by class and modification type, the number of contracts, post-modification outstanding balance, and the financial effects of the modification for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

(1) Includes $ 234 million of TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses related to non-PCD loans and leases. 

(2) Includes $ 60 million from acquired unfunded lending commitments. 

(3) Relates to day one impact of the CECL adjustment as a result of the implementation of ASU 2016-13. 

At September 30, 2021, the ACL was $ 2.2 billion, an increase of $ 339 million from the December 31, 2020 balance of $ 1.9 billion. The increase was primarily related to the addition of $ 432 million of allowance for loans purchased with credit deterioration and the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $ 294 million ($ 234 million from non-PCD loans and leases and $ 60 million from acquired unfunded lending commitments), partially offset by improvement in the forecasted macroeconomic environment resulting from anticipated lower unemployment and higher GDP. 

The economic scenarios used in the September 30, 2021 ACL determination contained significant judgmental assumptions and the ultimate impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the September 30, 2021 ACL included a material general reserve component as well as additional industry specific risk profiles, including profiles relating to the commercial real estate portfolio, to capture economic uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve.

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Fair value, beginning of period $ 327 &#160; $ 172 &#160; $ 210 &#160; $ 7 &#160; Fair value election for servicing assets previously measured using the amortized method (1) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 205 &#160; Servicing assets obtained in acquisition &#8212; &#160; `` &#8212; &#160; 59 &#160; &#8212; &#160; New servicing assets created 31 &#160; 30 &#160; 103 &#160; 70 &#160; Change in fair value during the period due to: Time decay (2) ( 4 ) ( 2 ) ( 11 ) ( 6 ) Payoffs (3) ( 17 ) ( 13 ) ( 50 ) ( 29 ) Changes in valuation inputs or assumptions (4) 1 &#160; 4 &#160; 27 &#160; ( 56 ) Fair value, end of period $ 338 &#160; $ 191 &#160; $ 338 &#160; $ 191 &#160; Weighted-average life (years) 7.0 6.4 7.0 6.4 

(1) Prior to January 1, 2020, substantially all of Huntington&#8217;s MSR assets were recorded at amortized cost. 

(2) Represents decrease in value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled principal payments and partial loan paydowns. 

(3) Represents decrease in value associated with loans that paid off during the period. 

(4) Represents change in value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates. 

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Therefore, the fair value of MSRs is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of MSRs. MSR values are highly sensitive to movement in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be greatly impacted by the level of prepayments. 

A summary of key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR value to changes in these assumptions at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020 follows: 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Decline in fair value due to Decline in fair value due to (dollar amounts in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change

Total servicing, late fees and other ancillary fees included in mortgage banking income was $ 22 million and $ 16 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, total servicing, late fees and other ancillary fees included in mortgage banking income was $ 57 million and $ 47 million, respectively. 

The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans serviced for third parties was $ 30.6 billion and $ 23.5 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Red Iron provides U.S. distributors and dealers and select Canadian distributors of the Toro and Exmark branded products with sources of financing. Huntington and Toro maintain a 55 % and 45 % ownership interest, respectively, in Red Iron. As Huntington has a controlling financial interest in Red Iron, its financial results are consolidated in Huntington's financial statements. Toro's interest is reported as a non-controlling interest within equity. 

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock and impact of preferred stock redemption) available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units and awards, and distributions from deferred compensation plans. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive.

12. NONINTEREST INCOME 

Huntington earns a variety of revenue including interest and fees from customers as well as revenues from non-customers. Certain sources of revenue are recognized within interest or fee income and are outside of the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). Other sources of revenue fall within the scope of ASC 606 and are generally recognized within noninterest income. These revenues are included within various sections of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table shows Huntington&#8217;s total noninterest income segregated between contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606 and those within the scope of other GAAP Topics.

2021 3Q Form 10-Q 77 

Huntington generally provides services for customers in which it acts as principal. Payment terms and conditions vary amongst services and customers, and thus impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Some fees may be paid before any service is rendered and accordingly, such fees are deferred until the obligations pertaining to those fees are satisfied. Most Huntington contracts with customers are cancelable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended September 30, 2021 is expected to be earned within one year. Huntington does not have significant balances of contract assets or contract liabilities and any change in those balances during the reporting period ended September 30, 2021 was determined to be immaterial. 

13. FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

See Note 20 &#8220;Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are summarized in the following tables:

The following tables present a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, for financial instruments measured on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3. The classification of an item as Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 measurements may also include observable components of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. The amounts presented represent the fair value on the various measurement dates throughout the period. The gains (losses) represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. 

The amounts measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2021 were as follows:

Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans held for investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. Periodically, in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized in the form of a charge-off.

(1) Certain disclosures related to quantitative level 3 fair value measurements do not include those deemed to be immaterial. 

The following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. 

Credit loss estimates, such as probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve. 

Discount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values. 

Net market price and pull through percentages generally increase when market interest rates increase and decline when market interest rates decline. Higher net market price and pull through percentages generally result in higher fair values.

(1) Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties. 

(2) Excludes securities without readily determinable fair values. 

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include trading account securities, customers&#8217; acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, FHLB advances, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in banks, interest-bearing deposits at FRB, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under resale agreements. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington&#8217;s exposure to changes in customer credit quality. Accordingly, their carrying values, which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates, are reasonable estimates of fair value.

Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage servicing rights, deposit base, and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above. Accordingly, this fair value information is not intended to, and does not, represent Huntington&#8217;s underlying value. Many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates. 

14. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or a liability (in other assets or other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value. 

Derivative financial instruments can be designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses on the hedging instruments in the income statement line item where the gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated in an effective hedge relationship under GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur. 

The following table presents the fair values and notional values of all derivative instruments included in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Amounts in the table below are presented gross without the impact of any net collateral arrangements.

Derivatives used in asset and liability management activities 

Huntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity, principally for asset and liability management purposes. Balance sheet hedging activity is generally arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment that can be classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are executed to hedge changes in fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Cash flow hedges are executed to modify interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. 

The following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments. 

September 30, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Fair Value Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Economic Hedges Total Instruments associated with: Investment securities $ 7,372 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7,372 &#160; Loans &#8212; &#160; 7,925 &#160; 271 &#160; 8,196 &#160; Long-term debt 4,756 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,756 &#160; Total notional value at September 30, 2021 $ 12,128 &#160; $ 7,925 &#160; $ 271 &#160; $ 20,324 &#160; December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in millions) Fair Value Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Economic Hedges Total Instruments associated with: Investment securities $ 3,484 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,484 &#160; Loans &#8212; &#160; 17,375 &#160; 1,271 &#160; 18,646 &#160; Long-term debt 6,197 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,000 &#160; 11,197 &#160; Total notional value at December 31, 2020 $ 9,681 &#160; $ 17,375 &#160; $ 6,271 &#160; $ 33,327 &#160; 

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. Adjustments to interest income were also recorded for the amounts related to the amortization of floors and forward-starting floors that were excluded from the hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of economic hedges, as well as the amounts related to terminated hedges reclassified from AOCI. The net amounts resulted in an increase to net interest income of $ 61 million and $ 82 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, and 2020, the net amounts resulted in an increase to net interest income of $ 291 million and $ 151 million, respectively. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings and offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item. 

Huntington has designated $ 7.0 billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the last-of-layer method. This approach allows the Company to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value basis adjustment on our hedged mortgage-backed securities is included in available-for-sale securities on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Huntington has also designated $ 0.4 billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate corporate bonds.

As of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges. 

Amortized Cost Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment To Hedged Items (dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Assets Investment securities (1) $ 17,630 &#160; $ 6,637 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 3 &#160; Liabilities Long-term debt 4,882 &#160; 6,383 &#160; 135 &#160; 232 &#160; 

(1) Amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. As of September 30, 2021, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 17.2 billion, the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was $ 1 million, and the amounts of the designated hedging instruments were $ 7.0 billion. 

The cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments remaining for any hedged assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting has been discontinued was $( 35 ) million and $( 62 ) million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

At September 30, 2021, Huntington has $ 7.9 billion of interest rate floors, floor spreads and swaps. These are designated as cash flow hedges for variable rate commercial loans indexed to LIBOR. The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in OCI and is reclassified into income when the hedged item impacts earnings. The initial premium paid for the interest rate floor contracts represents the time value of the contracts and is not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness. Any change in fair value related to time value is recognized in OCI. The initial premium paid is amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to interest income over the contractual life of these contracts. 

Gains and (losses) on interest rate floors, floor spreads, and swaps recognized in other comprehensive income were $( 29 ) million and $( 40 ) million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, gains and losses on interest rate floors and swaps recognized in other comprehensive income were $( 102 ) million and $ 279 million, respectively. 

Net investment Hedges 

Huntington has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the value of the Company&#8217;s investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities. The total notional amount of forward foreign exchange contracts at September 30, 2021 was $ 209 million.

Derivatives used in mortgage banking activities 

Mortgage loan origination hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to economically hedging Huntington&#8217;s mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is committed or locked. Forward commitments to sell economically hedge the possible loss on interest rate lock commitments due to interest rate change. The net asset position of these derivatives at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $ 34 million and $ 26 million, respectively. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year . 

MSR hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR asset and to mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR asset, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, TBA securities, Treasury futures contracts, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps. 

The notional value of the derivative financial instruments, the corresponding net asset (liability) position recognized in other assets and/or other liabilities, and net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging activity is summarized in the following table: 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Notional value $ 1,153 &#160; $ 1,170 &#160; Trading assets 17 &#160; 43 &#160;

MSR hedging trading assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Trading gains (losses) are included in mortgage banking income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Derivatives used in customer related activities 

Various derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consist of commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange contracts. Huntington enters into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities. 

The interest rate or price risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Foreign currency derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. Transactions are primarily in liquid currencies with Canadian dollars and Euros comprising a majority of all transactions. Commodity derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of various commodities. Hedging of energy-related products and base metals comprise the majority of these transactions. 

The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were $ 53 million and $ 70 million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including offsetting derivatives, were $ 53 billion and $ 37 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Huntington&#8217;s credit risk from customer derivatives was $ 787 million and $ 882 million at the same dates, respectively.

Financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 

Huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 13 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221;. 

Derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Additionally, collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and Huntington&#8217;s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups. 

Huntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties, and routinely exchanges cash and high quality securities collateral. Huntington enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment and risk management needs. These types of transactions generally are low dollar volume. Huntington enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties; however, collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties. 

In addition to the customer derivative credit exposure, aggregate credit risk associated with broker-dealer and bank derivative transactions, net of collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty, was $ 113 million and $ 175 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The credit risk associated with derivatives is calculated after considering master netting agreements. 

At September 30, 2021, Huntington pledged $ 486 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged $ 264 million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral. 

The following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Trust-Preferred Securities 

Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as such, are not consolidated within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Each issue of the junior subordinated debentures has an interest rate equal to the corresponding trust securities distribution rate. Huntington has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time-to-time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the related debentures. During any such extension period, distributions to the trust securities will also be deferred and Huntington&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will be restricted. Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to trust securities are guaranteed by Huntington to the extent of funds held by the trusts. The guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as the junior subordinated debt. The guarantee does not place a limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by Huntington. 

Affordable Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. 

Huntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in other assets. Investments that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Investment losses related to these investments are included in noninterest income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table presents the balances of Huntington&#8217;s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

Commitments to extend credit 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these financial agreements at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were as follows: 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 

Contract amount representing credit risk 

Commitments to extend credit: 

Commercial 

$ 28,226 &#160; $ 20,701 &#160; Consumer 

18,982 &#160; 14,808 &#160; Commercial real estate 

2,576 &#160; 1,313 &#160; Standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds 904 &#160; 581 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 

15 &#160; 21 &#160; 

Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer&#8217;s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. Collateral to secure any funding of these commitments predominately consists of residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans. 

Standby letters-of-credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years . Since the conditions under which Huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize, the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was $ 6 million and $ 5 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Commercial letters-of-credit represent short-term, self-liquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days . The goods or cargo being traded normally secure these instruments. 

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings. 

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, Huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each matter may be. 

Huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. 

94 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

For certain matters, Huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In cases in which Huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is $ 0 to $ 15 million at September 30, 2021 in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent Huntington&#8217;s maximum loss exposure. 

Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Huntington. Further, management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address Huntington&#8217;s contingent liabilities. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond Huntington&#8217;s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to Huntington&#8217;s results of operations for any particular reporting period. 

17. SEGMENT REPORTING 

Huntington&#8217;s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. The Company has four major business segments: Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. For a description of our business segments, see Note 26 - Segment Reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Listed in the following tables is certain operating basis financial information reconciled to Huntington&#8217;s September 30, 2021, December 31, 2020, and September 30, 2020, reported results by business segment.
