 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Truist Financial Corporation 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Truist Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the allowance for credit losses in 2020. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Certain Commercial and Consumer Portfolios 

As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. The consolidated ACL balance was $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, including $2.9 billion for commercial portfolios and $2.6 billion for consumer portfolios. Estimates of expected future credit losses are determined by management using quantitative models and by applying qualitative adjustments to the modeled results. The models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default, and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The models are applied to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The macroeconomic forecast data used in the quantitative models is based on forecasted variables for a reasonable and supportable period. The qualitative adjustments incorporate management judgment and are used to account for limitations in modeled results related to current economic conditions and other risks in the portfolios. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the ACL for certain commercial and consumer portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the ACL quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence related to the quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the ACL estimation process for certain commercial and consumer portfolios, which included controls related to the quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining the ACL for certain commercial and consumer portfolios quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments, including evaluating the appropriateness of the quantitative models and management&#8217;s methodology, testing the data used in the estimate, and evaluating the reasonableness of judgments used by management in estimating certain qualitative adjustments. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of these quantitative models and the reasonableness of judgments used by management relating to certain qualitative adjustments.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Assessment - CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB Reporting Units 

As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s consolidated goodwill balance was $24.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. The goodwill associated with the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units was $15.8 billion and $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, respectively. Management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Management determines the fair value of reporting units using the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, management determines the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis by utilizing a multi-year financial forecast for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions including net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and required capital. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of these reporting units using the income approach, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence related to management&#8217;s discount rates and net interest margin assumptions used in the income approach, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining the fair value of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units, evaluating the appropriateness of management&#8217;s income approach, testing the data used in the income approach, and evaluating the discount rates and net interest margin assumptions used by management in the income approach. Evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions related to the discount rates and net interest margin involved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the reporting units and consistency with external market and industry data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the income approach and the discount rate assumption.

92 Truist Financial Corporation 

NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation 

Truist Financial Corporation is a purpose-driven financial services company committed to inspire and build better lives and communities. With the combined history of BB&#38;T and SunTrust, Truist has leading market share in many high-growth markets in the country. The Company offers a wide range of services including retail, small business and commercial banking; asset management; capital markets; commercial real estate; corporate and institutional banking; insurance; mortgage; payments; specialized lending; and wealth management. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist is the sixth-largest commercial bank in the U.S. The Company operates and measures business activity across three business segments: Consumer Banking and Wealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Insurance Holdings. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s business segments, see "Note 21. Operating Segments." 

General 

See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this Report for terms used herein. The accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Truist Financial Corporation and those subsidiaries that are wholly or majority owned by Truist or over which Truist exercises control. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of companies or assets acquired are included from the date of acquisition. Results of operations associated with entities or net assets sold are included through the date of disposition. 

Truist holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are legal entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to independently finance its activities, or as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 

Investments in VIEs are evaluated to determine if Truist is the primary beneficiary. This evaluation gives appropriate consideration to the design of the entity and the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along, the relative power of each party, and to Truist's obligation to absorb losses or receive residual returns of the entity. Truist has variable interests in certain entities that are not required to be consolidated, including affordable housing and other partnership interests. Refer to "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional disclosures regarding Truist's VIEs. 

Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financing decisions are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, adjusted to reflect the Company&#8217;s portion of income, loss, or dividends of the investee. Truist records its portion of income or loss in Other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These investments are periodically evaluated for impairment. 

The Company reports any noncontrolling interests in its subsidiaries in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and separately presents the income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of a consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts reported in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Truist Financial Corporation 93 

Business Combinations 

Truist accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. See "Note 2. Business Combinations" for further discussion of the Merger and its impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks that have original maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. Restricted cash was immaterial at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Securities Financing Activities 

The Company borrows securities and purchases securities under agreements to resell as part of its securities financing activities. On the acquisition date of these securities, the Company and related counterparty agree on the amount of collateral required to secure the principal amount loaned under these agreements. The Company monitors collateral values daily and calls for additional collateral to be provided as warranted under the respective agreements. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold, plus accrued interest within Short-term borrowings. 

Trading Activities 

Various trading assets and liabilities are used to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of the Company's clients. Product offerings to clients include debt securities, loans traded in the secondary market, equity securities, derivative contracts, and other similar financial instruments. The Company elects to apply fair value accounting to trading loans. Trading loans include: (i) loans held in connection with the Company's trading business primarily consisting of commercial and corporate leveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii) loans made or acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business. Other trading-related activities include acting as a market maker for certain debt and equity security transactions, derivative instrument transactions, and foreign exchange transactions. Trading assets and liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized within Noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income on trading account securities is included in Interest on other earning assets. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s trading activities, see "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" and "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures." 

Investment Securities 

The Company invests in various debt securities primarily for liquidity management purposes and as part of the overall ALM process to optimize income and market performance. Investments in debt securities that are not held for trading purposes are classified as AFS. 

Interest income on securities is recognized in income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the security. As prepayments are received, a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. 

AFS securities are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI, net of deferred income taxes, in the Shareholders' equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses realized from the sale of AFS securities are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income. 

An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated at the balance sheet date to determine whether such losses are credit-related. Credit losses are measured on an individual basis and recognized in an ACL. Changes in expected credit losses are recognized in the Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Municipal securities are evaluated for impairment using a municipal bond credit scoring tool that leverages historical municipal market data to estimate probability of default and loss given default at the issuer level. U.S. Treasury securities, government guaranteed securities, and other securities issued by GSEs are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the US government, are highly rated by rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. There was no ACL on the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities at December 31, 2020. 

94 Truist Financial Corporation 

Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, investment securities in an unrealized loss position were evaluated quarterly for OTTI. Truist considered such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the fair value was below amortized cost, long term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments, Truist's intent to sell and whether it was more-likely-than-not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis. 

The credit component of an OTTI loss was recognized in earnings and the non-credit component was recognized in AOCI, net of tax, in situations where Truist did not intend to sell the security and it was more-likely-than-not that Truist would have been required to sell the security prior to recovery. Subsequent to recognition of OTTI, an increase in expected cash flows was recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected life of the security based on an evaluation of the nature of the increase. 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities that are not classified as trading assets or liabilities are recorded in Other assets on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are considered marketable and measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized as a component of Noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable equity securities include mutual fund investments and other publicly traded equity securities. Dividends received from marketable equity securities and FHLB stock are recognized within Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity securities that are not accounted for under the equity method and that do not have readily determinable fair values are considered non-marketable and are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Any adjustments to the carrying value of these non-marketable equity securities are recognized in Other noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-marketable equity securities include FHLB stock and other equity investments. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s equity securities, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures." 

LHFS 

LHFS includes residential and commercial mortgage loans that management intends to sell in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. 

The Company elects to apply fair value accounting to substantially all residential and commercial mortgage loans that are originated with the intent to be sold in the secondary market. Direct loan origination fees associated with these loans are recorded as Residential mortgage and Commercial real estate related income. The majority of direct origination costs are recorded in Personnel expense. The fair value of these loans is derived from observable current market prices when available and includes loan servicing value. When observable market prices are not available, the Company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. 

First lien residential mortgage LHFS are transferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE securitization transactions, whereby the loans are exchanged for cash or securities that are readily redeemable for cash with servicing rights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale of residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at inception of the associated interest rate lock commitments and reflect the change in value of the loans resulting from changes in interest rates from the time the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with borrowers until the loans are sold, adjusted for pull through rates and excluding hedge transactions initiated to mitigate this market risk. Commercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and FHLMC and the Company also issues and sells GNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured loans. The loans and securities are exchanged for cash with servicing rights retained. Gains and losses on sales of residential and commercial mortgage loans are included in Residential mortgage and Commercial real estate income, respectively. 

LHFS also includes specifically identified loans where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. These loans are generally recorded at LOCOM. Origination fees and costs for such loans are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized losses resulting from changes in fair value and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the loans are classified as Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available, but may also incorporate consideration of other unobservable inputs such as indicative bids, broker price opinions or other information derived from internal or external data sources. 

In certain circumstances, the Company may transfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At the time of transfer, any credit losses are subject to charge-off in accordance with the Company&#8217;s policy and are recorded as a reduction in the ALLL. Any subsequent losses, including those related to interest rate or liquidity-related valuation adjustments are recorded as a component of Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s LHFS, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures." 

Truist Financial Corporation 95 

Loans and Leases 

The Company's accounting methods for loans differ depending on whether the loans are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since the date of origination such that at the date of acquisition there is more than an insignificant deterioration in credit. 

Originated Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest and fees on loans and leases includes certain loan fees and deferred direct costs associated with the lending process recognized over the contractual lives of the loans using the effective interest method. 

Purchased Loans 

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. 

Fair values for purchased loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions are informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate are determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of the underlying loans. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rates do not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. 

Beginning January 1, 2020, purchased loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either PCD, which indicates that the loan reflects more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, or non-PCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in connection with the identification of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality, including but not limited to risk grades, delinquency, nonperforming status, previous troubled debt restructurings or bankruptcies and other qualitative factors that indicate deterioration in credit quality since origination. 

For PCD loans, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment and recognized as an adjustment to the acquisition price of the asset; thus, the sum of the loans&#8217; purchase price and initial ALLL estimate represents the initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value is the non-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD loans, the difference between the fair value and the par value is considered the fair value mark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is recorded with a corresponding charge to the Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent changes in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD loans are recognized in the Provision for credit losses. 

The non-credit discount or premium related to PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans are amortized or accreted to Interest and fees on loans and leases over the contractual life of the loans using the effective interest method for amortizing loans, and using a straight-line approach for interest-only loans and loans associated with a revolving commitment. In the event of prepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums are recognized in Interest and fees on loans and leases. 

96 Truist Financial Corporation 

TDRs 

Modifications to a borrower's debt agreement are considered TDRs if a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties that otherwise would not be considered. TDRs are undertaken to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan and may take the form of modifications that result in the stated interest rate of the loan being lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in certain limited circumstances, forgiveness of principal or interest. A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, Truist implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. Payment relief assistance provided by Truist includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company adopted certain provisions of the CARES Act and other regulatory guidance that provide relief from the requirement to apply TDR accounting to (1) certain modifications of federally backed mortgages upon request from the borrower, and (2) certain modifications of other non-federally backed mortgages for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that were less than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019. In other circumstances the Company applied TDR relief provided by the regulatory agencies for borrowers who received short-term modifications as a result of COVID-19 and were less than 30 days past due at the time that the Company's COVID-19 loan modification program was implemented, or for federally backed loans, the modification was mandated by the government in response to COVID-19. 

TDRs can be classified as performing or nonperforming, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower and an evaluation as to whether the borrower will be able to repay the loan based on the modified terms. In circumstances where the TDR involves charging off a portion of the loan balance, Truist classifies these TDRs as nonperforming. 

The decision to maintain a commercial TDR on performing status is based on a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the modified terms. This evaluation includes consideration of the borrower's current capacity to pay, which among other things may include a review of the borrower's current financial statements, an analysis of cash flow available to pay debt obligations, and an evaluation of secondary sources of payment from the borrower and any guarantors. This evaluation also includes an evaluation of the borrower's current willingness to pay, which may include a review of past payment history, an evaluation of the borrower's willingness to provide information on a timely basis, and consideration of offers from the borrower to provide additional collateral or guarantor support. The credit evaluation may also include review of cash flow projections, consideration of the adequacy of collateral to cover all principal and interest and trends indicating improving profitability and collectability of receivables. 

The evaluation of mortgage and other consumer loans includes an evaluation of the client's debt-to-income ratio, credit report, property value and certain other client-specific factors that impact the clients&#8217; ability to make timely principal and interest payments on the loan. 

TDR classification may be removed due to the passage of time if the loan: (i) did not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (ii) has performed in accordance with the modified terms (generally a minimum of six months), (iii) was reported as a TDR over a year-end reporting period, and (iv) reflected an interest rate on the modified loan that was no less than a market rate at the date of modification. TDR classification may also be removed for an accruing loan upon the occurrence of a subsequent non-concessionary modification granted at market terms and within current underwriting guidelines. In connection with consumer TDRs, a NPL will be returned to accruing status when (i) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments, (ii) management concludes that all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment, and (iii) there is a sustained period of repayment performance, generally a minimum of six months. 

NPAs 

NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of clients' loan defaults. 

Truist Financial Corporation 97 

Truist's policies for placing loans on nonperforming status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due. Payment deferrals granted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic do not result in a loan becoming past due. The following table summarizes the delinquency thresholds that are a factor used in evaluating nonperforming classification and the timing of charge-off evaluations: 

##TABLE_START (number of days) Placed on Nonperforming (1) Evaluated for Charge-off Commercial: Commercial and industrial 90 (2) 90 (2) CRE 90 (2) 90 (2) Commercial construction 90 (2) 90 (2) Lease financing 90 (2) 90 (2) Consumer: Residential mortgage (3) 90 to 180 90 to 210 Residential home equity and direct (3) 90 to 120 90 to 180 Indirect auto (3) 90 120 Indirect other (3) 90 to 120 120 to 180 Student (4) (5) NA 120 to 180 Credit card (6) NA 90 to 180 ##TABLE_END

(1) Loans may be returned to performing status when (i) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments, (ii) management concludes that all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment, and (iii) there is a sustained period of repayment performance, generally a minimum of six months . 

(2) Or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, whichever occurs first. 

(3) Depends on product type, loss mitigation status, status of the government guaranty, if applicable, and certain other product-specific factors. 

(4) Student loans are not placed in nonperforming status, which reflects consideration of governmental guarantees or accelerated charge-off policies related to certain non-guaranteed portfolios. 

(5) Claims related to government guaranteed loans may be filed once the loans reach 270 days past due. The non-guaranteed balance, which ranges from 2-3%, is charged off once the claim proceeds related to the guaranteed portion have been received. 

(6) Credit cards are generally not placed on nonperforming status, but are fully charged off at specified delinquency dates consistent with regulatory guidelines. 

When commercial loans are placed on nonperforming status, a charge-off is recorded, as applicable, to decrease the carrying value of such loans to the estimated recoverable amount. Consumer and credit card loans are subject to charge-off at a specified delinquency date consistent with regulatory guidelines. 

Certain past due loans may remain on performing status if management determines that it does not have concern over the collectability of principal and interest. Generally, when loans are placed on nonperforming status, accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period and amortization of deferred loan fees and expenses for originated loans, and fair value marks for purchased loans, is suspended. For commercial loans and certain consumer loans, payments received for interest and lending fees thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as concern exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. Interest income on nonperforming loans is recognized after the principal has been reduced to zero. If and when borrowers demonstrate the ability to repay a loan classified as nonperforming in accordance with its contractual terms, the loan may be returned to performing status upon meeting all regulatory, accounting and internal policy requirements. 

Accrued interest is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued interest receivable balances are not considered in connection with the ACL estimation process, as such amounts are generally reversed against interest income when the loan is placed in nonperforming status. The Company has deferred interest income recognition on the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest on loans that were provided payment relief assistance in connection with the CARES Act. 

Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic revaluations of the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. Truist's policies require that valuations be updated at least annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than six months old, otherwise an update is required. Any subsequent changes in value as well as gains or losses from the disposition of these assets are recognized in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s loan and lease activities, see "Note 5. Loans and ACL." 

98 Truist Financial Corporation 

ACL 

The ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. The ALLL is a valuation account that is deducted from or added to the loans&#8217; amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on loans. The entire amount of the ACL is available to absorb losses on any loan category or lending-related commitment. Loan or lease balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off are incorporated into the ALLL estimate, with such amounts capped at the aggregate of amounts previously charged off. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to the Provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The RUFC is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Portfolio segments represent the level at which Truist develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. Truist&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio consists of three portfolio segments; commercial, consumer and credit card. The expected credit loss models are generally developed one level below the portfolio segment level. In certain instances, loans are further disaggregated by similar risk characteristics, such as business sector, client type, funding type, type of collateral, whether loan payments are interest-only and whether interest rates are fixed or variable. Larger loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics or that are considered collateral-dependent are individually evaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any. Such estimates may be based on current loss forecasts, an evaluation of the fair value of the underlying collateral or in certain circumstances the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest as described further below. The commercial portfolio segment models use a risk rating approach to estimate the ALLL. Truist may also consider specific environmental, social, and governance considerations in the risk rating methodology for commercial loans. The consumer and credit card models use a delinquency-based approach to estimate the ALLL. In addition to these quantitatively calculated components, the ALLL includes qualitatively calculated components. 

Truist maintains a collectively calculated ALLL for loans with similar risk characteristics. The collectively calculated ALLL is estimated using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Truist maintains quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses. The credit loss forecasting models use portfolio balances, macroeconomic forecast data, portfolio composition and loan attributes as the primary inputs. Loss estimates are informed by historical loss experience adjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and current and expected portfolio risk characteristics. Expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a TDR. 

The Scenario Committee provides guidance, selection, and approval for enterprise-sanctioned macroeconomic forecast data, including the macroeconomic forecast data for use in the ACL process. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic forecast data across scenarios adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years. Assumptions revert to long term historic averages gradually over a one year period. Macroeconomic forecast data used in estimating the expected losses vary by loan portfolio and include employment factors, estimated collateral values and market indicators as described by portfolio segment below. A qualitative allowance which incorporates management&#8217;s judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations with respect to expected credit losses. This allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions, and capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. These events may include, but are not limited to, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which Truist conducts business. 

The methodology for determining the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the funded component of the ALLL and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. 

The ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The ACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and may recommend adjustments where necessary based on portfolio performance and other items that may impact credit risk. 

Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the ACL represented management&#8217;s estimate of probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. The estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to 2020 did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts. 

The following provides a description of accounting policies, methodologies and credit quality indicators related to each of the portfolio segments: 

Truist Financial Corporation 99 

Commercial 

The majority of loans in the commercial lending portfolio are assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrower's ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing borrowers' financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower. Risk ratings are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently for many relationships based on the policy requirements regarding various risk characteristics. While this review is largely focused on the borrower's ability to repay the loan, Truist also considers the capacity and willingness of a loan's guarantors to support the loan as a secondary source of repayment. When a guarantor exhibits the documented capacity and willingness to support the loan, Truist may consider extending the loan maturity and/or temporarily deferring principal payments if the ultimate collection of both principal and interest is reasonably assured. In these cases, Truist may determine the loan is not impaired due to the documented capacity and willingness of the guarantor to repay the loan. Loans are considered impaired when the borrower (or guarantor in certain circumstances) does not have the cash flow capacity or willingness to service the debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that the borrower will continue to pay according to the contractual agreement. The following table summarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to monitor credit quality in its commercial portfolio: 

##TABLE_START Risk Rating Description Pass Loans not considered to be problem credits Special Mention Loans that have a potential weakness deserving management's close attention Substandard Loans for which a well-defined weakness has been identified that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk Nonperforming Loans for which full collection of principal and interest is not considered probable ##TABLE_END 

Loans are generally pooled one level below the portfolio segment for the collectively calculated ALLL based on factors such as business sector, project and property type, line of business, collateral, loan type, obligor exposure, and risk grade or score. Commercial loss forecasting models are expected loss frameworks that use macroeconomic forecast data across scenarios and current portfolio attributes as inputs. The models forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The primary macroeconomic drivers for the commercial portfolios include unemployment trends, U.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental rates and property values. 

Truist's policy is to review and individually evaluate the reserve for all nonperforming lending relationships and TDRs with an outstanding balance of $ 5 million or more, as such lending relationships do not typically share similar risk characteristics with others. Individually evaluated reserves are based on current forecasts, the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the value of collateral, which is generally based on appraisals, recent sales of foreclosed properties and/or relevant property-specific market information. Truist has elected to measure expected credit losses on collateral-dependent loans based on the fair value of the collateral. Loans are considered collateral dependent when it is probable that Truist will be unable to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the agreement and repayment is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or continued operation of the underlying collateral. Commercial loans are typically secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral. 

Consumer and Credit Card 

The majority of the ALLL related to the consumer and credit card lending portfolios is calculated on a collective basis. Loans are pooled one level below the portfolio segment for the collectively calculated ALLL based on factors such as collateral, loan type, line of business and sales channel. Consumer portfolio models are expected loss frameworks that use macroeconomic forecast data across scenarios and current portfolio attributes as inputs. The models forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The primary macroeconomic drivers for the consumer portfolios include unemployment trends, the primary 30-year mortgage rate, home price indices and used car prices. 

Residential mortgages and revolving home equity lines of credit are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. The indirect auto and indirect other portfolios include secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. The student loan portfolio is composed of government guaranteed student loans and certain private student loans. The government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. Private student loans were originated with a credit enhancement from a third-party which partially mitigates the Company&#8217;s credit exposure. During 2020, the Company discontinued new origination of private student loans. The credit card portfolio and other arrangements within the indirect other and residential home equity and direct portfolios are generally unsecured and are actively managed. 

Truist uses performing status to monitor credit quality in its consumer and credit card portfolios. Delinquency status is the primary factor considered in determining whether a loan should be classified as nonperforming. 

The ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is based on analyses capturing the expected credit losses and the impact of the concession over the remaining life of the asset. 

100 Truist Financial Corporation 

Expected recoveries for consumer and credit card loans are included in the estimation of the ALLL based on historical experience. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises, equipment, finance leases and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and is recorded within the corresponding Noninterest expense categories on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the improvements&#8217; estimated useful lives or the lease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived asset or asset group, including premises and equipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value based on the undiscounted cash flows. 

Lessee operating and finance leases 

Truist has operating and finance leases for data centers, corporate offices, branches, retail centers, and certain equipment, and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases with an original lease term in excess of one year are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Premises and equipment and Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease costs are recorded in Net occupancy expense or Equipment expense based on the underlying asset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate in determining the present value of lease payments when readily determinable, and a collateralized incremental borrowing rate when an implicit rate is not available. Lease terms consider options to extend or terminate based on the determination of whether such renewal or termination options are deemed reasonably certain. 

Lease agreements that contain non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component. Variable costs, such as maintenance expenses, property and sales taxes, association dues and index based rate increases, are expensed as they are incurred. 

The impairment policy for a ROU asset is discussed within the Premises and Equipment section above. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

Life insurance policies on certain current and former directors, officers and teammates, for which Truist is the owner and beneficiary are stated at the cash surrender value within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in cash surrender value and proceeds from insurance benefits are recorded in Income from bank-owned life insurance in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Income Taxes 

The Company&#8217;s provision for income taxes is based on income and expense reported for financial statement purposes after adjustments for permanent differences such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities, tax credits, and amortization expense related to qualified affordable housing investments. In computing the provision for income taxes, the Company evaluates the technical merits of its income tax positions based on current legislative, judicial, and regulatory guidance. The deferral method of accounting is used on investments that generate investment tax credits, such that the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related investment. Additionally, the Company recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies on employee share-based payments as a component of the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These tax effects, generally determined upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock, are treated as discrete items in the period in which they occur. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses and other income and expenses recorded in AOCI. For additional information related to the Company's unrealized gains and losses, see "Note 13. AOCI." 

DTAs and DTLs result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. These deferred assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to apply in the periods in which the DTAs or DTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these deferred assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the Provision for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. 

Truist Financial Corporation 101 

Interest and penalties related to the Company&#8217;s tax positions are recognized as a component of the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s activities related to income taxes, see "Note 14. Income Taxes." 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company records derivative contracts at fair value in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether or not it has been designated in a formal, qualifying hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized within Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This includes derivatives that the Company enters into in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions and as a risk management tool to economically hedge certain identified risks associated with assets carried at fair value such as MSRs, along with certain interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage and commercial loans that are a normal part of the Company&#8217;s operations. The Company also evaluates contracts, such as brokered deposits and debt, to determine whether any embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for as freestanding derivatives. 

Certain derivatives used as risk management tools are designated as accounting hedges and are used to mitigate the Company&#8217;s exposure to changes in interest rates or other identified market risks. The Company prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges of (i) changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge) attributable to a specified risk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness, along with support for management&#8217;s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. Methodologies related to hedge effectiveness include (i) statistical regression analysis of changes in the cash flows of the actual derivative and hypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical regression analysis of changes in the fair values of the actual derivative and the hedged item. 

For designated hedging relationships, the Company generally performs subsequent assessments of hedge effectiveness using a qualitative approach. 

Below is a summary of the cash flow and fair value hedge programs utilized by Truist: 

##TABLE_START Cash Flow Hedges Fair Value Hedges Risk exposure 

Variability in cash flows of interest payments on floating rate loans, overnight funding and various LIBOR and successor rate funding instruments. 

Changes in value on fixed rate long-term debt, FHLB advances, loans and AFS securities due to changes in interest rates. Risk management objective Hedge the variability in the interest payments and receipts on future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the first unhedged payments and receipts of variable interest due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. Convert the fixed rate paid or received to a floating rate, primarily through the use of swaps. Treatment during the hedge period Changes in value of the hedging instruments are recognized in AOCI until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. The amount reclassified to earnings is recorded in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Changes in value of both the hedging instruments and the assets or liabilities being hedged are recognized in the income statement line item associated with the asset or liability being hedged. Treatment if hedge ceases to be highly effective or is terminated Hedge is dedesignated. Changes in value recorded in AOCI before dedesignation are amortized to yield over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If hedged item remains outstanding, the basis adjustment that resulted from hedging is amortized into earnings over the designated hedged period or the maturity date of the instrument, and cash flows from terminated hedges are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item. Treatment if transaction is no longer probable of occurring during forecast period or within a short period thereafter Hedge accounting ceases and any gain or loss in AOCI is recognized in earnings immediately.

102 Truist Financial Corporation 

Derivatives expose the Company to risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract does not perform as expected. The Company manages its exposures to counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with defined exposure limits based on their credit quality and in accordance with established policies and procedures. All counterparties are reviewed regularly as part of the Company&#8217;s credit risk management practices and appropriate action is taken to adjust the exposure limits to certain counterparties as necessary. The Company&#8217;s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA agreements or other legally enforceable industry standard master netting agreements. In certain cases and depending on the nature of the underlying derivative transactions, bilateral collateral agreements are also utilized. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to OTC derivative clearing requirements, which require certain derivatives to be cleared through central clearing houses. These clearing houses require the Company to post initial and variation margin to mitigate the risk of non-payment, the latter of which is received or paid daily based on the net asset or liability of the contracts. The Company applies settlement to market treatment for the cash collateralizing derivative contracts with certain centrally cleared counterparties. Derivative balances with these counterparties are considered settled by the collateral, and the implementation of the settlement to market treatment was applied based on the effective date of rulebook changes made by the applicable counterparties. 

When the Company has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, and there exists a legal right of setoff with that counterparty, the Company considers its exposure to the counterparty to be the net fair value of its derivative positions with that counterparty. If the net fair value is positive, then the corresponding asset value also reflects cash collateral held. The Company offsets derivative transactions with a single counterparty as well as any cash collateral paid to and received from that counterparty for derivative contracts that are subject to ISDA or other legally enforceable netting arrangements and meet accounting guidance for offsetting treatment. 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivative activities, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures" and "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments." 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as business combinations. Truist allocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. 

The goodwill of each reporting unit is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. If, after assessing all relevant events or circumstances, Truist concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value, then an impairment test is required. Truist may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the impairment test. In the quantitative test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, then there is no impairment. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. The quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and the market approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. The market approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit. 

The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates and applicable valuation multiples based on comparable public company information. Truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of historic bank control premiums and the current market. 

CDI and other intangible assets include premiums paid for acquisitions of core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, are amortized over their useful lives, based upon the estimated economic benefits received. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s activities related to goodwill and other intangibles, see "Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." 

Truist Financial Corporation 103 

MSRs 

Truist has two classes of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. Both classes of MSRs are accounted for primarily at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Residential mortgage income and Commercial real estate related income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of servicing rights is impacted by a variety of factors, including prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually-specified servicing fees, servicing costs, and underlying portfolio characteristics. These risks are hedged with various derivative instruments that are intended to mitigate the income statement effect to changes in fair value. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties and comparisons to market transactions. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s servicing rights, see "Note 8. Loan Servicing." 

Fair Value Measurement 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value. The Company classifies inputs used in valuation techniques within the fair value hierarchy discussed in "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures." 

When measuring assets and liabilities at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis include trading securities, derivative instruments, AFS securities, and certain other equity securities. Assets and liabilities that the Company has elected to measure at fair value on a recurring basis include trading loans, loans originated to be sold and classified as LHFS, and residential and commercial MSRs. Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as when assets are evaluated for impairment, the basis of accounting is lower of cost or market, or for disclosure purposes. Examples of these non-recurring fair value measurements include certain LHFS and loans and leases held for investment, OREO, certain cost or equity method investments, and intangible and long-lived assets. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s valuation of assets and liabilities held at fair value, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures." 

Equity-Based Compensation 

Truist maintains various equity-based compensation plans that provide for the granting of RSAs, RSUs and PSUs to selected teammates and directors. Truist values share-based awards at the grant date fair value and recognizes the expense over the requisite service period taking into account retirement eligibility. Compensation expense is recognized in Personnel expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation plans, see "Note 15. Benefit Plans." 

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 

Truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. The discount rate assumption used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high quality corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plan such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests, adjusted for the weight of each asset class in the target mix. 

Revenue Recognition 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company recognizes two primary types of revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Income, Interest income and Noninterest income. The Company&#8217;s principal source of revenue is interest income from loans and securities, which is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. For information on the Company&#8217;s policies for recognizing interest income on loans and securities, see the "Loans and Leases," "LHFS," "Trading Activities," and "Investment Securities" sections within this Note. 

Noninterest income includes revenue from various types of transactions and services provided to clients. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers as performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligations are typically satisfied in one year or less. Truist elected the practical expedient to expense the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, remaining performance obligations consisted primarily of insurance and investment banking services for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 

104 Truist Financial Corporation 

Insurance income 

Insurance commissions are received on the sale of insurance products as agent or broker, and revenue is recognized at a point in time upon the placement date of the insurance policies, representing the Company&#8217;s related performance obligations. Payment is normally received within the policy period. In addition to placement, Truist also provides insurance policy related risk management services. The Company&#8217;s execution of these risk management services represents its performance obligations. Revenue is recognized over time as these services are provided. Performance-based commissions are recognized when received or earlier when, upon consideration of past results and current conditions, the revenue is deemed not probable of reversal. Insurance commissions are included in the IH operating segment. Refer to "Note 21. Operating Segments" for information on segment results. 

Transaction and service-based revenues 

Transaction and service-based revenues include Service charges on deposits, Wealth management income, Card and payment related fees, and Investment banking income. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the transactions occur or over time as services are performed over primarily monthly or quarterly periods. Payment is typically received in the period the transactions occur or, in some cases, within 90 days of the service period. Fees may be fixed or, where applicable, based on a percentage of transaction size or managed assets. These revenues, and their relationship to the Company&#8217;s operating segments, are further described by type below. Refer to "Note 21. Operating Segments" for information on segment results. 

Service charges on deposits include account maintenance, cash and treasury management, wire transfers, ATM, overdraft and other deposit-related fees. The Company&#8217;s execution of the services related to these fees represents its performance obligations. Each of these performance obligations are either satisfied over time or at a point in time as the services are provided to the client. The Company is the principal when rendering these services. Payments for services provided are either withdrawn from client accounts as services are rendered or in the billing period following the completion of the service. The transaction price for each of these fees is based on the Company&#8217;s predetermined fee schedules. Service charges on deposits are recognized in the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB operating segments. 

Wealth management income includes trust and investment management income, retail investment and brokerage services, and investment advisory and other specialty wealth management fees. The Company&#8217;s execution of these services represents its related performance obligations. The Company generally recognizes trust and investment management and advisory revenue over time as services are rendered based on either a percentage of the market value of the assets under management or advisement, or fixed based on the services provided to the client. Fees are generally swept from the client&#8217;s account either in advance of or in arrears based on the prior period&#8217;s asset balances under management or advisement. The Company also offers selling and distribution services and earns commissions through the sale of annuity and mutual fund products, acting as agent in these transactions and recognizing revenue at a point in time when the client enters into an agreement with the product carrier. The Company may also receive trailing commissions and 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and annuity products and recognizes this revenue in the period earned. Retail trade execution commissions are earned and recognized on the trade date with payment on the settlement date. Wealth management income is included in the CB&#38;W operating segment. 

Card and payment related fees include interchange fees from credit and debit cards, merchant acquirer revenue and other card related services. Interchange fees are earned by the Company each time a request for payment is initiated by a client at a merchant for which the Company transfers the funds on behalf of the client. Interchange rates are set by the payment network and are based on purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees are received daily and recognized at a point in time when the card transaction is processed, which represents the Company&#8217;s related performance obligation. The Company is considered an agent of the client and incurs costs with the payment network to facilitate the interchange with the merchant; therefore, the related payment network expense is recognized as a reduction of card fees. Truist also offers rewards and/or rebates to its client based on card usage. The costs associated with these programs are recognized as a reduction of card fees. Card and payment related fees are recognized in the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB operating segments. 

Investment banking and trading income includes securities underwriting fees, advisory fees, loan syndication fees, and trade execution services revenue. Underwriting fees are earned on the trade date when the Company, as a member of an underwriting syndicate, purchases the securities from the issuer and sells the securities to third party investors. Each member of the syndicate is responsible for selling its portion of the underwriting and is liable for the proportionate costs of the underwriting; therefore, the Company&#8217;s portion of underwriting revenue and expense is presented gross within noninterest income and noninterest expense. The transaction price is based on a percentage of the total transaction amount and payments are settled shortly after the trade date. Fees for merger and acquisition advisory services, including various activities such as business valuation, identification of potential targets or acquirers, and the issuance of fairness opinions, are generally earned and recognized by the Company when performance obligations are satisfied. The Company&#8217;s execution of the advisory services related to these fees represents its performance obligations. The Company is the principal when rendering these services. The transaction price is based on contractually specified terms agreed upon with the client for each advisory service. Loan syndication fees are typically recognized at the closing of a loan syndication transaction. Revenue related to corporate trade execution services is earned and recognized on the trade date with payment on the settlement date. Investment banking and trading income is included in the C&#38;CB operating segment. 

Truist Financial Corporation 105 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, plus common share equivalents calculated for stock options, warrants, and restricted stock outstanding using the treasury stock method. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s EPS, see "Note 20. Computation of EPS." 

Related Party Transactions 

The Company periodically enters into transactions with certain of its executive officers, directors, affiliates, trusts, and/or other related parties in its ordinary course of business. The Company is required to disclose material related party transactions, other than certain compensation and other arrangements entered into in the normal course of business. Information related to the Company&#8217;s relationships with VIEs and employee benefit plan arrangements is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Subsequent Events 

The Company evaluated events that occurred between December 31, 2020 and the date the accompanying financial statements were issued, and there were no material events, other than those already discussed, that would require recognition in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the accompanying Notes.

Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements 

##TABLE_START Standard / Adoption Date Description Effects on the Financial Statements Standards Adopted During the Current Year Credit Losses / January 1, 2020 Replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with an expected credit loss methodology and requires consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis are presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses. Purchased credit deteriorated loans receive an allowance for expected credit losses. Any credit impairment on AFS debt securities for which the fair value is less than cost is recorded through an allowance for expected credit losses. The standard also requires expanded disclosures related to credit losses and asset quality. Truist adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $3.1 billion increase to the ALLL and a $2.1 billion decrease to Retained earnings adjusted for deferred taxes and other impacts. A policy election was made to dissolve the existing PCI loan pools. The amortized cost basis of PCD assets was increased by $378 million at January 1, 2020, which reflects the initial estimate of credit losses for these assets. The remaining noncredit discount will be accreted to Interest and fee income on loans and leases over the contractual lives of the underlying assets using an effective interest method for amortizing loans and a straight-line approach for interest-only loans and loans with revolving privileges. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the AFS securities portfolio. Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment / January 1, 2020 Simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill, by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The standard requires an entity to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, with the loss limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard must be applied on a prospective basis. The standard does not currently have an impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements; however, if subsequent to adoption, the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value, the Company would be required to recognize an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. Reference Rate Reform / March 12, 2020 Provides optional expedients and exceptions regarding the accounting for contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The standard was issued March 12, 2020, is effective upon issuance and can be applied through December 31, 2022. 

The company elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to derivative contract modifications and discounting transition beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. This election did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Certain other practical expedients not yet elected by the Company may simplify the accounting for reference rate reform, if elected in the future.

NOTE 2. Business Combinations 

Effective December 6, 2019, the Company completed its Merger with SunTrust. The Merger was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the Merger date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. Fair value estimates related to the acquired assets and liabilities are subject to adjustment until all necessary information related to the valuation process has been received. Adjustments were finalized within one year of the closing date of the Merger. Immaterial amounts of the intangible assets recognized are deductible for income tax purposes. 

The following table sets forth the allocation of Merger consideration to the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of SunTrust as of December 6, 2019:

The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities. 

Cash and cash equivalents; Interest-bearing deposits with banks, and Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements: The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.

Trading assets and AFS Securities: Fair values for trading and AFS securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar instruments, quoted market prices that are not in an active market or other inputs that are observable in the market. In the absence of observable inputs, fair value is estimated based on pricing models and/or discounted cash flow methodologies. The majority of AFS securities were priced by third party vendors whereas trading securities are priced internally. All securities are subject to IPV. Trading loans are valued primarily using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third party pricing service. 

LHFS: The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted for servicing, interest rate risk and credit risk. 

Loans and leases: Fair values for loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions are informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate was determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rates do not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. All of the merged loans were marked to fair value as of the Merger date and therefore, there was no allowance related to these loans. 

CDI: This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships with certain deposit clients. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected client attrition rates, cost of the deposit base, reserve requirements, net maintenance cost attributable to client deposits and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources. The discount rates used for CDI assets are based on current market rates. The CDI is being amortized over 10 years based upon the estimated economic benefits received. 

MSRs: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Commercial MSRs are valued using a cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows. 

Deposits: The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the Merger date. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

Short-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings are reasonable estimates of fair value based on the short-term nature of these liabilities. The fair value of securities sold short is determined in the same manner as trading securities. 

Long-term debt : The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 

Preferred stock: The fair values of preferred stock are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instruments. 

Branch Divestitures 

In July 2020, Truist completed the divestiture of 30 branches to First Horizon Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of First Horizon National Corporation, to satisfy regulatory requirements in connection with the Merger. The branches were located in North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia. There were $ 425 million in loans and leases and $ 2.2 billion in deposits divested as part of this transaction. 

Acquisitions 

During 2020, Truist acquired several insurance companies, which resulted in $ 450 million of goodwill and $ 346 million of identifiable intangible assets in the IH segment. The intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average term of 15.4 years based upon the estimated economic benefits received. Goodwill of $ 171 million and identifiable intangible assets of $ 160 million are deductible for tax purposes.

NOTE 3. Securities Financing Activities 

Securities purchased under resale agreements are primarily collateralized by U.S. government or agency securities and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold, plus accrued interest. Securities borrowed are primarily collateralized by corporate securities. The Company borrows securities and purchases securities under agreements to resell as part of its securities financing activities. On the acquisition date of these securities, the Company and the related counterparty agree on the amount of collateral required to secure the principal amount loaned under these arrangements. The Company monitors collateral values daily and calls for additional collateral to be provided as warranted under the respective agreements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total market value of collateral held was $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.4 billion, of which $ 27 million and $ 135 million was repledged, respectively. The following table presents securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements: 

##TABLE_START December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 1,158 &#160; $ 986 &#160; Securities borrowed 587 &#160; 431 &#160; Total securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements $ 1,745 &#160; $ 1,417 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Company would be obligated to provide additional collateral in the event of a significant decline in fair value of the collateral pledged. This risk is managed by monitoring the liquidity and credit quality of the collateral, as well as the maturity profile of the transactions. Refer to "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information related to pledged securities. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as secured borrowings. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s related activity, by collateral type and remaining contractual maturity:

At December 31, 2020, no ACL was established for AFS securities. Substantially all of the unrealized losses on the securities portfolio were the result of changes in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers or underlying loans. The majority of the unrealized loss on states and political subdivisions securities was the result of fair value hedge basis adjustments that are a component of amortized cost.

NOTE 5. Loans and ACL 

The following tables present loans and leases HFI by aging category. Government guaranteed loans are not placed on nonaccrual status regardless of delinquency because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. The past due status of loans that received a deferral under the CARES Act is generally frozen during the deferral period. In certain limited circumstances, accommodation programs result in the delinquency status being reset to current.

The following table presents the carrying amount of loans by risk rating and performing status. Student loans are excluded as there is nominal risk of credit loss due to government guarantees or other credit enhancements. PCI loans were excluded because their related ALLL is determined by loan pool performance, and credit card loans were excluded as these loans are charged-off rather than reclassified as nonperforming:

(1) Includes amounts assumed in the Merger. 

(2) Balance is prior to the adoption of CECL. 

(3) Includes the adoption of CECL, the ALLL for PCD acquisitions and other activity. 

The adoption of CECL increased the ALLL $ 3.1 billion. The following discussion summarizes the changes in the factors that influenced Truist&#8217;s ACL estimate. 

The commercial ALLL increased $ 2.1 billion for year ended December 31, 2020. The increase reflects the adoption of CECL and a more pessimistic outlook with respect to future economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase also reflects specific consideration of the risks associated with exposures to certain industries most impacted by COVID-19, including oil and gas, hospitality, and lending to small businesses. 

The consumer ALLL increased $ 2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase reflects the impact of CECL and the more pessimistic outlook described above, with the largest increases seen in the unsecured portfolios and the non-prime auto lending portfolio. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in outstanding loans in the residential mortgage and residential home equity and direct portfolios. 

The ALLL for credit card increased $ 237 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase reflects the adoption of CECL and the more pessimistic outlook described above, which was partially offset by a reduction due to lower loan balances. 

The RUFC increased $ 24 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase reflects the adoption of CECL and the more pessimistic outlook described above. 

Truist&#8217;s ACL estimate represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded commitments, at the balance sheet date. This estimate incorporates both quantitatively-derived output, as well as qualitative components that represent expected losses not otherwise captured by the models. 

The quantitative models have been designed to estimate losses using macroeconomic forecast data over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, which management has determined to be two years, followed by a reversion to long-term historical loss conditions over a one-year period. These macroeconomic forecasts data include a number of key economic variables utilized in loss forecasting that include, but are not limited to, unemployment trends, US real GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental rates, property values, the primary 30-year mortgage rate, home price indices and used car prices. 

The primary economic forecast incorporates a third-party baseline forecast that is adjusted to reflect Truist&#8217;s interest rate outlook. Management also considered multiple third party macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to capture uncertainty in the economic environment. The economic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at December 31, 2020 included a GDP recovery to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 with a stable unemployment rate through the middle of 2021 followed by continued improvement through the remainder of the reasonable and supportable period. 

116 Truist Financial Corporation 

Quantitative models have certain limitations with respect to estimating expected losses in times of rapidly changing macroeconomic forecasts. As a result, management believes that the qualitative component of the ACL, which incorporates management&#8217;s expert judgment related to expected future credit losses, will continue to be a prominent factor in establishing the ACL for the foreseeable future. The December 31, 2020 ACL estimate includes qualitative adjustments to address limitations in modeled results with respect to forecasted economic conditions that are well outside of historic economic ranges used to develop the models and to give consideration to other risks in the portfolio, including the impact of government relief programs, stimulus and client accommodations, that are not directly considered in the quantitative models. 

PCD Loan Activity 

For PCD loans, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is recognized in the ALLL on the date of acquisition using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The following table provides a summary of purchased student loans with credit deterioration at acquisition:

NOTE 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Truist performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for its CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB and IH reporting units as of October 1, 2020. Based on the results of the impairment analyses, the Company concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceed their respective carrying values; therefore, there was no goodwill impairment. However, for the C&#38;CB reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of this reporting unit may be at risk of impairment. The Company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2020, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of December 31, 2020. See "Note 1. Basis of Presentation," for additional information regarding Truist&#8217;s goodwill accounting policy. 

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to operating segments are reflected in the table below. The adjustments for 2020 include measurement period adjustments to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and the reallocation of net assets to the underlying reporting units. The adjustments to CDI and other intangibles did not have a material impact to estimated amortization expense for the next five years. Adjustments to the reallocation of net assets to Truist's reporting units include updates to the estimated operating results and the finalization of corporate expense allocations. Refer to "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional information on the Merger and IH acquisitions, and "Note 21. Operating Segments" for additional information on segments.

NOTE 8. Loan Servicing 

The Company acquires servicing rights and retains servicing rights for certain of its sales or securitizations of residential mortgages and commercial loans. Servicing rights on residential and commercial mortgages are capitalized by the Company as MSRs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income earned by the Company on its residential MSRs is derived primarily from contractually specified mortgage servicing fees and late fees, net of curtailment costs. Income earned by the Company on its commercial mortgage servicing rights is derived primarily from contractually specified servicing fees and other ancillary fees.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the above table, the effect of an adverse variation in one assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the effect of the change. See "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures" for additional information on the valuation techniques used. 

Commercial Mortgage Activities 

The following table summarizes commercial mortgage servicing activities for the periods presented: 

##TABLE_START December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 UPB of CRE mortgages serviced for others $ 36,670 &#160; $ 70,404 &#160; CRE mortgages serviced for others covered by recourse provisions 9,019 &#160; 8,676 &#160; Maximum recourse exposure from CRE mortgages sold with recourse liability 2,624 &#160; 2,479 &#160; Recorded reserves related to recourse exposure 18 &#160; 13 &#160; CRE mortgages originated during the year-to-date period 6,739 &#160; 8,062 &#160; Commercial MSRs at fair value 245 &#160; 247 &#160; ##TABLE_END

In the third quarter of 2020, the Company transferred certain servicing activities involving cancellable servicing rights to third parties, resulting in a decrease in the UPB of CRE mortgages serviced for others. This transfer did not materially impact commercial MSRs.

Share Repurchase Activity 

In December 2020, Truist announced the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021 to optimize Truist's capital position. During 2018, the Company repurchased $ 1.2 billion of common stock, which represented 23.2 million shares, through a combination of open market and accelerated share repurchases. Repurchased shares revert to the status of authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase. 

Preferred Stock 

Dividends on the preferred stock are non-cumulative and payable when declared by the Company's Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board. The Company issued depositary shares, each of which represents a fractional ownership interest in a share of the Company's preferred stock. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption is solely at the option of the Company in whole or in part after the earliest redemption date at the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends. Prior to the redemption date, the Company has the option to redeem in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event.

Issuances 

During 2020, Truist issued a total of $ 3.5 billion in series O, series P, series Q and series R preferred stock to further strengthen its capital position. During 2019, the Company issued $ 1.7 billion of series N non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. 

Upon closing of the Merger, each outstanding share of SunTrust perpetual preferred stock was converted into the right to receive one share of an applicable newly issued series of Truist preferred stock having substantially the same terms as such share of SunTrust preferred stock. The Company issued series I, J, K, L and M non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a total par and fair value of $ 2.0 billion on the Merger closing date. Refer to the table below for additional details regarding the preferred shares and dividends and "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional information related to the Merger. 

Redemptions 

During 2020, the Company redeemed all 5,000 outstanding shares of its perpetual preferred stock series K and the corresponding depositary shares representing fractional interests in such series for $ 500 million plus any unpaid dividends. The preferred stock redemption was in accordance with the terms of the Company&#8217;s Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, effective as of December 6, 2019. 

During 2019, the Company redeemed all 23,000 outstanding shares of series D and 46,000 outstanding shares of series E non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the corresponding depositary shares representing fractional interests in each such series for $ 1.7 billion. Regular dividends on the redeemed shares were paid during the third quarter of 2019. In connection with the redemptions, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $ 46 million to recognize the difference in the redemption price and the carrying value. 

Subsequent Event 

Early in 2021, the Company announced the forthcoming redemption of all 18,000 outstanding shares of its perpetual preferred stock series F and the corresponding depositary shares representing fractional interests in such series for $ 450 million and all 20,000 outstanding shares of its perpetual preferred stock series G and the corresponding depositary shares representing fractional interests in such series for $ 500 million.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. DTAs and DTLs are measured using the enacted federal and state tax rates in the periods in which the DTAs or DTLs are expected to be realized. The net deferred income tax liability is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Significant DTAs and DTLs, net of the federal impact for state taxes, are presented in the following table.

The amount of UTBs that would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized, was $ 100 million and $ 99 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are recorded in the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company had a gross liability of $ 12 million and $ 11 million for interest and penalties related to its UTBs at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of gross expense related interest and penalties on UTBs was immaterial. 

The Company files U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns. The Company's federal income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by the IRS for taxable years prior to 2017. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2013. It is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $ 15 million during the next 12 months due to completion of tax authority examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitations. It is uncertain how much, if any, of this potential decrease will impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate.

NOTE 15. Benefit Plans 

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans 

Truist provides defined benefit retirement plans qualified under the IRC that cover most teammates. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employee's compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment. 

In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the IRC. Although technically unfunded plans, Rabbi Trusts and insurance policies on the lives of certain of the covered employees are available to finance future benefits. 

The Company's defined benefit plans obtained through the Merger were combined during 2020. 

The following tables present a summary of the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the qualified pension plan net asset is recorded as a component of Other assets and the nonqualified pension plans net liability is recorded as a component of Other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31.

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Truist considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data for each asset category, as well as historical actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long-term rate of return for the plan based on target asset allocations contained in the Company's Investment Policy Statement. For 2021, the expected rate of return on plan assets is 6.7 %.

The Company's primary total return objective is to achieve returns that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies the fiduciary requirements of the ERISA. The plan assets have a long-term time horizon that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon that extends well beyond a full market cycle, and can assume an above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard deviation of annual return. The investments are broadly diversified among economic sector, industry, quality and size in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Within approved guidelines and restrictions, investment managers have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments. 

Truist periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment policy and makes changes to its target asset allocation. Truist has established guidelines within each asset category to ensure the appropriate balance of risk and reward. The following table presents the fair values of the qualified pension plan assets by asset category:

(1) The plan may hold up to 10% of its assets in Truist common stock. 

International equity securities include a common/commingled fund that consists of assets from several accounts, pooled together, to reduce management and administration costs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, investments totaling $ 773 million and $ 341 million, respectively, have been excluded from the table above as valued based on net asset value as a practical expedient. 

Defined Contribution Plans 

Truist offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution plans that permit teammates to contribute up to 50 % of cash compensation. For full-time teammates who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, Truist makes matching contributions of up to 6 % of the employee's compensation. The Company's contribution expense for the 401(k) Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $ 272 million, $ 152 million and $ 141 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Certain teammates of subsidiaries participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan with different matching formulas. The Company's defined contribution plan obtained through the Merger was combined during 2020. 

Equity-Based Compensation Plans 

At December 31, 2020, RSAs, RSUs and PSUs were outstanding from equity-based compensation plans that have been approved by shareholders and plans assumed from acquired entities. Those plans are intended to assist the Company in recruiting and retaining teammates, directors and independent contractors and to align the interests of eligible participants with those of Truist and its shareholders. 

The majority of outstanding awards and awards available to be issued relate to plans that allow for accelerated vesting of awards for holders who retire and have met all retirement eligibility requirements or in connection with certain other events. Until vested, certain of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the common stock price on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends that will be foregone during the vesting period. Substantially all awards are granted in February of each year. Grants to non-executive teammates primarily consist of RSUs.

Other Benefits 

There are various other employment contracts, deferred compensation arrangements and non-compete covenants with selected members of management and certain retirees. These plans and their obligations are not material to the financial statements. 

NOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies 

Truist utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to risks. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees and derivatives. Truist also has commitments to fund certain affordable housing investments and contingent liabilities related to certain sold loans. 

Tax Credit and Certain Equity Investments 

The Company invests in certain affordable housing projects throughout its market area as a means of supporting local communities. Truist receives tax credits related to these investments, for which the Company typically acts as a limited partner and therefore does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. Truist typically provides financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. Tax credits are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level. Truist's maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity, exclusive of any potential tax recapture associated with the investments. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as the Company's other loans and are generally secured. 

Additionally, the Company invests in other community development entities as a limited partner and/or a lender. The Company receives tax credits for its limited partner investments. The Company has determined that the majority of the related partnerships are VIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these investments. Truist uses the equity method of accounting for these investments. 

The Company also invests in entities that promote renewable energy sources as a limited partner. Tax credits received for these investments are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of these investments. The Company has determined that these renewable energy tax credit partnerships are VIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' financial performance and therefore, it is not required to consolidate these VIEs. The Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss related to these investments is limited to its equity investments in these partnerships and any additional unfunded equity commitments. 

Truist Financial Corporation 133 

Truist has investments in and future funding commitments related to private equity and certain other equity method investments. The risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and future funding commitments made.

Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees 

Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit are primarily lines of credit to businesses and consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse change clauses, which allow Truist to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers' creditworthiness. The fair values of commitments are estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated based on the counterparties' creditworthiness and average default rates for loan products with similar risks. Consumer lending and revolving credit commitments have an immaterial fair value as Truist typically has the unconditional ability to cancel such commitments. Refer to "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures" for additional disclosures on the RUFC. 

Truist has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain recourse provisions. These provisions generally require Truist to reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred after the disposal of the property. Truist also issues standard representations and warranties related to mortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for additional disclosures related to these exposures. 

Letters of credit and financial guarantees are unconditional commitments issued by Truist to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and, as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. 

The following is a summary of selected notional amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments:

134 Truist Financial Corporation 

Derivatives 

Truist enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates. For additional information on derivative instruments, see "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments." 

Total Return Swaps 

The Company facilitates matched book TRS transactions on behalf of clients, whereby a VIE purchases reference assets identified by a client and the Company enters into a TRS with the VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the client. The Company provides senior financing to the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund the purchase of the reference assets. The TRS contracts pass through interest and other cash flows on the reference assets to the third party clients, along with exposing those clients to decreases in value on the assets and providing them with the rights to appreciation on the assets. The terms of the TRS contracts require the third parties to post initial margin collateral, as well as ongoing margin as the fair values of the underlying reference assets change. 

The Company concluded that the associated VIEs should be consolidated because the Company has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses, and the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant. At December 31, 2020, the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected $ 1.3 billion of assets and $ 41 million of other liabilities of the VIEs. At December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected $ 2.7 billion of assets and $ 116 million of other liabilities of the VIEs. Assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 include $ 1.3 billion and $ 2.6 billion in trading loans, respectively. The activities of the VIEs are restricted to buying and selling the reference assets and the risks/benefits of any such assets owned by the VIEs are passed to the third party clients via the TRS contracts. For additional information on TRS contracts and the related VIEs, see "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments." 

Other Commitments 

Truist holds public funds in certain states that do not require 100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting uncollateralized deposit shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon the public deposits held by each bank within the respective state) by the remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that state. Truist monitors deposits levels relative to the total public deposits held by all depository institutions within these states. The likelihood that the Company would have to perform under this guarantee is dependent on whether any financial institutions holding public funds default, as well as the adequacy of collateral coverage. 

In the ordinary course of business, Truist indemnifies its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from pending litigation. Truist also issues standard representations and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnification arrangements provide similar indemnifications to Truist. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, Truist does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of Truist. 

As a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock. The board of directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase Truist's investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future investments in the FLHB stock are not determinable. 

The Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation for trade comparisons, netting and settlement of fixed income securities. As a Government Securities Division netting member, the Company has a commitment to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation to meet its financial obligations as a central counterparty clearing house in the event the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation has insufficient liquidity recourses through a potential committed liquidity resource repurchase transaction. Any commitment would be based on the Company&#8217;s share of its liquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Truist does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of Truist. 

Truist Financial Corporation 135 

Pledged Assets 

Certain assets were pledged to secure municipal deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, certain derivative agreements, and borrowings or borrowing capacity, as well as for other purposes as required or permitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable asset discounts when determining borrowing capacity. The Company obtains secured financing and letters of credit from the FRB and FHLB. The Company&#8217;s letters of credit from the FHLB can be used to secure various client deposits, including public fund relationships. Excluding assets related to employee benefit plans, the majority of the agreements governing the pledged assets do not permit the other party to sell or repledge the collateral. Additional assets were pledged to the FRB of Richmond in the first quarter of 2020 following the Merger. The following table provides the total carrying amount of pledged assets by asset type.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

Truist and/or its subsidiaries are routinely parties to numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigation and regulatory investigations, arising from the ordinary conduct of its regular business activities. The matters range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with multiple class members and can involve claims for substantial amounts. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation and may consist of a variety of claims, including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims, and the ultimate resolution of any proceeding is uncertain and inherently difficult to predict. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows of Truist. 

In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, Truist establishes accruals for legal matters when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals for legal matter are based on management&#8217;s best judgment after consultation with counsel and others, as warranted. 

The Company&#8217;s estimate of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued, ranges from zero to approximately $ 200 million as of December 31, 2020. This estimated range is based upon currently available information and involves considerable judgment, given that claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete, and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated, among other factors. In addition, the matters underlying this estimated range will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from this estimate. As a result, the Company does not believe that an estimate of reasonably possible losses can be made for certain matters. Such matters are not reflected in the range provided here. 

The following is a description of certain legal proceedings in which Truist is involved: 

Bickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank 

This class action case was filed in the Fulton County State Court on July 12, 2010, and an amended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010. Plaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees charged to his account which related to debit card and ATM transactions are actually interest charges and therefore subject to the usury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought claims for violations of civil and criminal usury laws, conversion, and money had and received. On October 6, 2017, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification and defined the class as "Every Georgia citizen who had or has one or more accounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or debit card transaction (the "Transaction"); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a refund of those Fees" and the granting of a certified class was affirmed on appeal. On April 8, 2020, the Company filed a motion seeking to narrow the scope of this class and on May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed motion to compel arbitration of the claims of some of the class members. On February 9, 2021, the trial court denied both motions as premature but held that the issues could be raised again after the conclusion of discovery, which is currently underway. The Company believes that the claims are without merit.

NOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions 

Truist Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain "well-capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations. 

Truist is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Truist's capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Truist is in full compliance with these requirements. Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for IDIs: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Truist and Truist Bank were classified as "well-capitalized," and management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to year end that would change this designation. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Truist to maintain minimum ratios of CET1 ratio of 4.5 %, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 %, Total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0 %, Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio) of 4.0 % and supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 %. Truist is subject to a 2.7 % SCB that became applicable on October 1, 2020. Truist Bank is subject to a 2.5 % capital conservation buffer. The SCB and capital conservation buffer are amounts above the minimum levels designed to ensure that banks remain well-capitalized, even in adverse economic scenarios. 

Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

As an approved seller/servicer, Truist Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of capital, as specified by various agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Truist Bank's capital was above all required levels.

NOTE 18. Fair Value Disclosures 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level measurement hierarchy: 

&#8226; Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 

&#8226; Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets

(1) Refer to "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments" for additional discussion on netting adjustments. 

At December 31, 2020, investments totaling $ 314 million have been excluded from the table above as valued based on net asset value as a practical expedient. 

The following discussion focuses on the valuation techniques and significant inputs for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Available for Sale and Trading Securities: Securities accounted for at fair value include both the available-for-sale and trading portfolios. The Company uses prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to estimate the fair value of securities. The majority of AFS securities were priced by third party vendors whereas trading securities are priced internally. The AFS securities and trading securities are subject to IPV. Management independently evaluates the fair values of AFS Securities and trading securities through comparisons to external pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the pricing service and other third party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on any security sales to the pricing information received from the pricing service. Fair value measurements for trading securities are derived from observable market-based information including, but not limited to, overall market conditions, recent trades, comparable securities, broker quotes and FINRA&#8217;s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine data when determining the value of a position. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon the sale of a security. 

As described by security type below, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. 

Truist Financial Corporation 139 

Trading loans: The Company has elected to measure trading loans at fair value. Trading loans are valued primarily using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third party pricing service. Trading loans include: 

&#8226; loans held in connection with the Company's trading business primarily consisting of commercial and corporate leveraged loans; 

&#8226; SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government; and 

&#8226; loans made or acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business. 

U.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities are valued using quoted prices in active over-the-counter markets. 

GSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities consist of debt obligations issued by HUD, the FHLB, and other agencies, as well as securities collateralized by loans that are guaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Agency MBS includes pass-through securities and CMO issued by GSEs and U.S. government agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by the issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including benchmark TBA security pricing and yield curves that were estimated based on U.S. Treasury yields and certain floating rate indices. The pricing matrices for these securities may also give consideration to pool-specific data supplied directly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using market-based pricing matrices that are based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above. 

States and political subdivisions: The Company&#8217;s investments in U.S. states and political subdivisions include obligations of county and municipal authorities and agency bonds, which are general obligations of the municipality or are supported by a specified revenue source. Holdings are geographically dispersed, with no significant concentrations in any one state or municipality. Additionally, all municipal obligations are highly rated or are otherwise collateralized by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. These securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer spreads, material event notices and benchmark yield curves. 

Non-agency MBS: No non-agency MBS were held as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, Non-agency MBS in the trading portfolio included purchased interests in third party securitizations that have a high investment grade rating, and the pricing matrices for these securities were based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above; as such, these securities were classified as level 2. Non-agency MBS in the AFS securities portfolio included investments in Re-REMIC trusts that primarily hold U.S. Treasury securities and non-agency MBS, which were valued based on broker pricing models that use baseline securities yields and tranche-level yield adjustments to discount cash flows using market convention prepayment speed and default assumptions. These investments were classified as level 3. 

Corporate and other debt securities: These securities consist primarily of corporate bonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds are senior and subordinated debt obligations of domestic corporations. The Company acquires commercial paper that is generally short-term in nature and highly rated. These securities are valued based on a review of quoted market prices for similar assets as well as through the various other inputs discussed previously. 

LHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are originated to be sold to investors are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted for servicing, interest rate risk, and credit risk. The changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage LHFS. 

MSRs: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios and then are discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, other observable market data. Commercial MSRs are valued using a cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows. The Company considers actual and expected loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors that are determined based on current market conditions. Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for additional discussion. 

140 Truist Financial Corporation 

Derivative assets and liabilities: The Company holds derivative instruments for both trading and risk management purposes. These include exchange-traded futures or option contracts, OTC swaps, options, forwards and interest rate lock commitments. The fair values of derivatives are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable assumptions for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity and credit. The fair values of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as Level 3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that are not expected to fund and include the value attributable to the net servicing fees. Funding rates are based on the Company&#8217;s historical data. The fair value attributable to servicing is based on discounted cash flows, and is impacted by prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually-specified servicing fees, servicing costs and underlying portfolio characteristics. 

Equity securities: Equity securities primarily consist of exchange-traded securities and are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 

Private equity investments: In many cases there are no observable market values for these investments and therefore management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating performance of the investee to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant judgment, and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated. 

Securities sold short: Securities sold short represent debt securities sold short that are entered into as a hedging strategy for the purposes of supporting institutional and retail client trading activities. The fair value of securities sold short is determined in the same manner as trading securities. 

Activity for Level 3 assets and liabilities is summarized below:

Truist Financial Corporation 141 

During 2020, Truist sold non-agency MBS previously categorized as Level 3 that represented ownership interests in various tranches of Re-REMIC trusts. The Re-REMIC tranches did not have an active market and therefore were categorized as Level 3. 

During 2020, as a result of a change in control of the funds&#8217; manager, the Company deconsolidated certain SBIC funds for which it had previously concluded that it was the primary beneficiary. Following the deconsolidation, the investments in SBIC funds are valued based on net asset value per unit, as provided by the fund manager as a practical expedient, which approximates the fair value, and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The SBIC funds in which the Company invests primarily focus on equity and subordinated debt investments in privately-held middle market companies. The majority of these VIE investments are not redeemable and distributions are received as the underlying assets of the funds liquidate. The timing of distributions, which are expected to occur on various dates over the next 10 years, is uncertain and dependent on various events such as recapitalizations, refinance transactions and ownership changes among others. As of December 31, 2020, restrictions on the ability to sell the investments include, but are not limited to, consent of a majority of members or general partner approval for transfer of ownership. These investments are spread over numerous privately-held middle market companies, and thus the sensitivity to a change in fair value for any single investment is limited. 

Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for additional information on valuation techniques and inputs for MSRs. 

Fair Value Option 

The following table details the fair value and UPB of LHFS that were elected to be measured at fair value. Trading loans, included in other trading assets, were also elected to be measured at fair value.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

The following table provides information about certain assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The carrying values represent end of period values, which approximate the fair value measurements that occurred on the various measurement dates throughout the period. The valuation adjustments represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. These assets are considered to be Level 3 assets (2019 excludes PCI).

LHFS with valuation adjustments in the table above consisted primarily of residential mortgages and commercial loans that were valued using market prices and measured at the lower of cost or market. LHFS as of December 31, 2020 includes the small ticket loan and lease portfolio. The table above excludes $ 125 million of LHFS carried at cost at December 31, 2020 that did not require a valuation adjustment during the period. The remainder of LHFS is carried at fair value. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the Company held $ 5 million in nonperforming LHFS at December 31, 2020 and $ 107 million of nonperforming LHFS at December 31, 2019. LHFS that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest were not material at December 31, 2020. Loans and leases are primarily collateral dependent and may be subject to liquidity adjustments. Refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for additional discussion of individually evaluated loans and leases. Other includes foreclosed real estate, other foreclosed property, ROU assets, premises and equipment and OREO, and consists primarily of residential homes, commercial properties, vacant lots and automobiles. ROU assets are measured based on the fair value of the assets, which considers the potential for future sublease income. The remaining assets are measured at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 

For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, estimates of fair value are based on relevant market data and information about the instruments. Values obtained relate to trading without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership, possible tax ramifications, estimated transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various instruments. 

An active market does not exist for certain financial instruments. Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions and interest rate risk characteristics, loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates. Financial assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value are summarized below:

Credit Derivative Instruments 

As part of the Company&#8217;s corporate investment banking business, the Company enters into contracts that are, in form or substance, written guarantees; specifically, credit default swaps, risk participations and TRS. The Company accounts for these contracts as derivatives. 

The Company has entered into TRS contracts on loans. To mitigate its credit risk, the Company typically receives initial margin from the counterparty upon entering into the TRS and variation margin if the fair value of the underlying reference assets deteriorates. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s TRS contracts, see "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies." 

Truist has entered into risk participation agreements to share the credit exposure with other financial institutions on client-related interest rate derivative contracts. Under these agreements, the Company has guaranteed payment to a dealer counterparty in the event the counterparty experiences a loss on the derivative due to a failure to pay by the counterparty&#8217;s client. The Company manages its payment risk on its risk participations by monitoring the creditworthiness of the underlying client through the normal credit review process that the Company would have performed had it entered into a derivative directly with the obligors. At December 31, 2020, the remaining terms on these risk participations ranged from less than one year to 10 years. The potential future exposure represents the Company&#8217;s maximum estimated exposure to written risk participations, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments based on scenario simulations and assuming 100% default by all obligors on the maximum value.

Additionally, OT&#38;C houses intercompany eliminations, including intersegment net referral fees and residual interest rate risk after segment allocations have taken place.

Truist emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client service, sales effectiveness and relationship management along with an organizational focus on referring clients between businesses. The objective is to provide Truist&#8217;s entire suite of products to its clients with the end goal of providing clients the best financial experience in the marketplace. To promote revenue growth, revenues of certain products and services are reflected in the results of the segment providing those products and services and are also allocated to CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB. These allocated revenues between segments are reflected as net referral fees in noninterest income and eliminated in OT&#38;C. 

The segment results are presented based on internal management methodologies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The performance of the segments is not comparable with Truist&#8217;s consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships between the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 

Because business segment results are presented based on management accounting practices, the transition to the consolidated results prepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain differences, which are reflected as residuals in OT&#38;C. Business segment reporting conventions include, but are not limited to, the items as detailed below. 

Segment net interest income reflects matched maturity funds transfer pricing, which ascribes credits or charges based on the economic value or cost created by assets and liabilities of each segment. Residual differences between these credits and charges are captured in OT&#38;C. 

Noninterest income includes inter-segment referral fees, as well as federal and state tax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax equivalent basis, related primarily to certain community development investments. Recoveries for these allocations are reported in OT&#38;C. 

Corporate expense allocations, including overhead or functional expenses that are not directly charged to the segments, are allocated to segments based on various drivers (number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan balances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for these allocations are reported in OT&#38;C. 

Provision for credit losses represents net charge-offs by segment combined with an allocation to the segments for the provision attributable to each segment&#8217;s quarterly change in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes is calculated using a blended income tax rate for each segment and includes reversals of the noninterest income tax adjustments described above. The difference between the calculated provision for income taxes at the segment level and the consolidated provision for income taxes is reported in OT&#38;C. 

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is an active process and undergoes periodic enhancements. The implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the results disclosed for each segment, with no impact on consolidated results. If significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is revised, when practicable.
