 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, other information contained in this document, as well as with Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Regulatory Considerations 

The regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Truist is subject to banking laws and regulations, and various other laws and regulations, which affect the operations and management of Truist and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. Truist and its subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. Refer to Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional disclosures with respect to significant laws and regulations affecting Truist. 

The descriptions below summarize updates since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 to state and federal laws to which Truist is subject. These descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations, and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions. 

On March 19, 2021, the FRB announced the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at the FRB from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio will expire as scheduled on March 31, 2021; this temporary relief added 24 basis points to the Company&#8217;s supplementary leverage ratio as of March 31, 2021. The FRB also announced plans to propose several potential modifications to the supplementary leverage ratio to ensure that the supplementary leverage ratio remains effective in an environment of higher reserves, though such proposal had not been published as of the date of this report.

Supporting Communities 

In February 2021, Truist issued its first social bond for $1.3 billion, becoming the first U.S. regional bank to issue a social bond. Truist also became the lead investor for Greenwood, an innovative digital banking platform designed for Black and Latinx consumers and business owners. In addition, Truist received an &#8216;Outstanding&#8217; CRA rating for its community development efforts and continued to make great progress towards the Company&#8217;s $60 billion Community Benefits Plan, after ending 2020 at 114 percent of the annual target. 

Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2021 totaled $1.3 billion, up 35.3 percent, compared with the first quarter last year. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the first quarter of 2021 were $0.98, an increase of $0.25 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Truist&#8217;s results of operations for the first quarter of 2021 produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.17 percent and an annualized return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 8.69 percent compared to prior year returns of 0.90 percent and 6.58 percent, respectively. Results for the first quarter of 2021 included merger-related and restructuring charges of $141 million ($108 million after-tax), incremental operating expenses related to the Merger of $175 million ($134 million after-tax), and an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges of $36 million ($28 million after-tax). Results for the first quarter of 2020 included $107 million ($82 million after-tax) of merger-related and restructuring charges and $74 million ($57 million after-tax) of incremental operating expenses related to the Merger. 

Truist&#8217;s revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $5.5 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was also $5.5 billion for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $138 million compared to the same period in 2020, reflecting a decrease of $374 million in TE net interest income, and an increase of $236 million in noninterest income. 

NIM was 3.01 percent for the first quarter of 2021, down 57 basis points compared to the prior year. Average earning assets increased $30.4 billion, as average securities increased $46.5 billion, partially offset by a decline in average loans and leases of $8.2 billion, and average other earning assets of $6.3 billion. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $7.8 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $35.4 billion. The annualized TE yield on the total loan portfolio for the first quarter of 2021 was 4.09 percent, down 89 basis points compared to the prior year. The annualized TE yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.45 percent, down 117 basis points compared to the prior year. The average costs of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.28 percent, down 74 basis points compared to the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $48 million compared to $893 million for the first quarter of 2020. The earlier quarter included an increase to the ACL for the significant uncertainty of the economic impacts resulting from the onset of the pandemic. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2021 totaled $238 million compared to $272 million in the earlier quarter. The net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.33 percent was down three basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2021 increased $236 million compared to the earlier quarter, driven by increases in insurance income of $77 million, and investment banking and trading income of $222 million. Other income increased $76 million primarily due to income from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by higher personnel expense. Other income also includes a $37 million gain from the divestiture of certain businesses, which was mostly offset by gains from credit default swaps recorded in the earlier quarter. Lending related fees increased $33 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in residential mortgage income of $145 million, as well as a decline in service charges on deposits of $47 million. 

Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2021 was up $179 million compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $34 million and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $101 million. The current quarter also includes $36 million of expense associated with an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges. Excluding the items mentioned above, changes in amortization of intangibles, and a small gain from debt extinguishment, adjusted noninterest expense was up $32 million compared to the earlier quarter. Additionally, increases in personnel expense of $170 million were partially offset by declines in net occupancy expense, marketing and customer development, and operating lease depreciation. 

The provision for income taxes was $351 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $224 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 of 19.2 percent, compared to 17.4 percent for the earlier quarter. The higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and discrete tax expenses resulting from the divestiture of certain businesses in the current year. 

Truist&#8217;s total assets at March 31, 2021 were $517.5 billion, an increase of $8.3 billion compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in total assets was primarily a result of an increase of $13.2 billion in interest-bearing deposits driving higher balances held at the Federal Reserve and an increase of $3.0 billion in AFS securities. These increases were partially offset by an $8.6 billion decline in total loans and leases. 

Truist Financial Corporation 37 

Total deposits at March 31, 2021 were $395.6 billion, an increase of $14.5 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Deposit growth was strong for the first quarter of 2021 driven by growth resulting from additional government stimulus programs and pandemic-related client behavior, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits primarily due to the maturity of wholesale negotiable certificates of deposit and higher-cost personal accounts. 

Asset quality ratios were stable at March 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, nonperforming assets were 0.25 percent of total assets. The allowance for loan and lease loss coverage ratio was 4.84x nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 4.39x at December 31, 2020. 

Truist maintained strong capital and liquidity. As of March 31, 2021, the CET1 ratio was 10.1 percent and the average LCR was 111 percent. During the first quarter of 2021, Truist completed $506 million of share repurchases and also redeemed $950 million of preferred stock. The Company issued $1.3 billion of senior long-term debt. In connection with the redemptions of preferred stock, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $26 million to recognize the difference between the redemption price and the carrying value. Truist declared common dividends of $0.45 per share during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in dividend and total payout ratios for the first quarter of 2021 of 45.4 percent and 83.3 percent, respectively. In April 2021, Truist declared common dividends of $0.45 per share for the second quarter of 2021. Additionally in April 2021, the Company announced the redemption of $465 million in preferred stock for Series H. 

Analysis of Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income and NIM 

First Quarter 2021 compared to First Quarter 2020 

Net interest margin was 3.01 percent, down 57 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The yield on the total loan portfolio for the first quarter of 2021 was 4.09 percent, down 89 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases and lower purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.45 percent, down 117 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to lower yields on new purchases. 

The average cost of total deposits was 0.05 percent, down 46 basis points compared to the earlier quarter and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.07 percent, down 63 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 0.82 percent, down 94 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 1.57 percent, down 77 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. 

As of March 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits, and long-term debt were $2.1 billion, $15 million, and $196 million, respectively. The remaining unamortized fair value mark on loans and leases consists of $1.1 billion for consumer loans and leases, and $978 million for commercial loans and leases. These amounts will be recognized over the remaining contractual lives of the underlying instruments or as paydowns occur. 

The major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.

Provision for Credit Losses 

First Quarter 2021 compared to First Quarter 2020 

The provision for credit losses was $48 million, compared to $893 million for the earlier quarter. The earlier quarter included the significant uncertainty of the economic impacts resulting from the onset of the pandemic. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2021 totaled $238 million compared to $272 million in the earlier quarter. The net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.33 percent was down three basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist&#8217;s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist&#8217;s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates. 

Table 2: Noninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) % Change 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Insurance income $ 626 $ 549 14.0 % Wealth management income 341 332 2.7 Service charges on deposits 258 305 (15.4) Residential mortgage income 100 245 (59.2) Investment banking and trading income 340 118 188.1 Card and payment related fees 200 187 7.0 Lending related fees 100 67 49.3 Operating lease income 68 77 (11.7) Commercial real estate related income 43 44 (2.3) Income from bank-owned life insurance 50 44 13.6 Securities gains (losses) &#8212; (2) NM Other income (loss) 71 (5) NM Total noninterest income $ 2,197 $ 1,961 12.0 

First Quarter 2021 compared to First Quarter 2020 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2021 increased $236 million compared to the earlier quarter. Investment banking and trading income increased $222 million due to the impact from CVA recoveries in the current period compared to losses in the earlier quarter and strong investment banking income from equity originations, loan syndications, and asset securitization transactions. Insurance income increased $77 million due to new business and higher retention, as well as acquisitions. Other income increased $76 million primarily due to income from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which was primarily offset by higher personnel expense. Other income also includes a $37 million gain from the divestiture of certain businesses, which was mostly offset by gains from credit default swaps recorded in the earlier quarter. Lending related fees increased $33 million due to gains from the sale of finance leases. Residential mortgage banking income decreased $145 million primarily due to lower production related revenues as a result of lower gain on sale margins and volumes, as well as lower servicing income due to a reduction in the third-party servicing portfolio as a result of prepayments. Service charges on deposits decreased $47 million due to reduced overdraft incident rates.

Noninterest Expense 

The following table provides a breakdown of Truist&#8217;s noninterest expense: 

Table 3: Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) % Change 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Personnel expense $ 2,142 $ 1,972 8.6 % Professional fees and outside processing 350 247 41.7 Net occupancy expense 209 221 (5.4) Software expense 210 210 &#8212; Amortization of intangibles 144 165 (12.7) Equipment expense 113 116 (2.6) Marketing and customer development 66 84 (21.4) Operating lease depreciation 50 71 (29.6) Loan-related expense 54 62 (12.9) Regulatory costs 25 29 (13.8) Merger-related and restructuring charges 141 107 31.8 Loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt (3) &#8212; NM Other expense 109 147 (25.9) Total noninterest expense $ 3,610 $ 3,431 5.2 

First Quarter 2021 compared to First Quarter 2020 

Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2021 was up $179 million compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $34 million and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $101 million, primarily reflected in professional fees and outside processing. The current quarter also includes $36 million of expense associated with an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges. Excluding the items mentioned above and changes in amortization of intangibles and a small gain from debt extinguishment, adjusted noninterest expense was up $32 million compared to the earlier quarter. Personnel expense increased $170 million primarily due to higher incentive expenses due to improved performance, higher equity-based compensation expense, higher other employee benefits, partially offset by lower salaries due to fewer FTEs. Other expense also includes decreases of $42 million for non-service-related pension cost components and $20 million for teammate travel. There was also a decrease of $51 million from net occupancy expense, marketing and customer development and operating lease depreciation. 

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges

CB&#38;W net income was $803 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $128 million compared to the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income decreased $119 million primarily due to a decline in the funding credit provided on liabilities and lower purchase accounting accretion. Noninterest income decreased $145 million driven by lower residential mortgage income due to lower gain on sale margins and volumes, partially offset by gains from the divestiture of certain businesses. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $337 million reflecting an allowance build during the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the deteriorating economic outlook caused by the onset of the pandemic, as well as a benefit from lower charge offs in the auto portfolios compared to the prior year. Noninterest expense decreased $94 million primarily due to lower amortization of intangibles, merger-related expenses, and occupancy expenses in the current quarter. 

CB&#38;W average loans held for investment decreased $6.4 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the earlier quarter, primarily driven by lower residential mortgage lending due to elevated prepayments and home equity lending, partially offset by increased mortgage warehouse lending and indirect auto lending. Average total deposits increased $30.6 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to the impact of the government stimulus programs and lower consumer spending.

Noninterest expense decreased $87 million primarily due to lower personnel related expenses, merger-related expenses, and operating lease depreciation in the current quarter. 

C&#38;CB average loans held for investment decreased $418 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the earlier quarter, primarily due to reduced dealer floor plan and commercial real estate lending as well as lower utilization rates for corporate client lines offset by growth in commercial and industrial loans through the PPP.

Other, Treasury &#38; Corporate 

Net income in OT&#38;C can vary due to the changing needs of the Corporation, including the size of the investment portfolio, the need for wholesale funding and variability associated with derivatives used to hedge the balance sheet. 

OT&#38;C generated a net loss of $369 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $138 million in the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income decreased $127 million primarily due to lower net funding charges to other segments due to lower market rates, partially offset by lower interest expense on borrowings. Noninterest income increased $68 million primarily due to income from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $74 million due to changes in the reserve for unfunded commitments and an allowance build in the earlier quarter resulting from the onset of the pandemic. Noninterest expense increased $321 million primarily due to higher incremental operating expenses related to the Merger and higher merger-related charges in the current quarter. The benefit for income taxes increased $75 million primarily due to a higher pre-tax loss in the current quarter.

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Activities 

The securities portfolio totaled $123.8 billion at March 31, 2021, compared to $120.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to a $3.0 billion increase in Agency MBS, reflecting the redeployment of excess liquidity associated with deposit inflows during the quarter. 

As of March 31, 2021, approximately 1.6 percent of the securities portfolio was variable rate, compared to 1.9 percent as of December 31, 2020. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 6.0 years at March 31, 2021, compared to 4.0 years at December 31, 2020. 

U.S. Treasury, GSE, and Agency MBS represented 99.6 percent of the total securities portfolio as of March 31, 2021, unchanged compared to the prior year end.

Average loans and leases held for investment for the first quarter of 2021 were $294.7 billion, down $8.2 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Average commercial loans decreased $4.5 billion primarily due to a $1.8 billion decrease in average PPP loans, an $819 million decrease in average CRE loans, a $647 million decrease due to the transfer of $1.0 billion of certain loans and leases to held for sale late in the fourth quarter of 2020, and continued paydowns on revolving credit lines. 

Average consumer loans decreased $3.6 billion primarily due to refinance activity resulting in a decline in residential mortgages and residential home equity and direct loans. This was partially offset by an increase in indirect auto loans.

COVID-19 Lending Activities 

The CARES Act created the PPP, which has temporarily expanded the Small Business Administration&#8217;s business loan guarantee program. The carrying value of PPP loans was $10.1 billion as of March 31, 2021. The CARES Act additionally includes provisions that were designed to encourage financial institutions to support borrowers impacted by COVID-19. These modifications are generally not considered a TDR. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional disclosures related to modifications and TDRs.

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.3 billion at March 31, 2021, down $88 million compared to December 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.42 percent of total loans and leases, down two basis points compared to December 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment decreased $159 million, primarily in the commercial and industrial portfolio, while nonperforming loans held for sale increased $67 million as a portfolio of residential mortgage loans was transferred to held for sale during the quarter. 

Performing TDRs were up $178 million during the first quarter primarily in the residential mortgage and commercial and industrial portfolios. The increase in residential mortgage was driven by modifications of loans that were not eligible for relief in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. The increase in commercial and industrial loan modifications was driven by an increase in the volume of loans entering workout agreements. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2021, up $64 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily in residential mortgage loans due to the repurchase of delinquent government guaranteed loans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.71 percent at March 31, 2021, up four basis points from the prior quarter. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.04 percent at March 31, 2021, unchanged from December 31, 2020. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2021, down $432 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily in consumer loans for residential mortgage and indirect automobile due to seasonality and consumers receiving stimulus funds. The ratio of loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.61 percent at March 31, 2021 down, 13 basis points from the prior quarter. 

Problem loans include NPLs and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in Table 10. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to &#8220;Note 4. Loans and ACL&#8221; for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. As a result, Truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on a loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES Act, Truist implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. Payment relief assistance provided by Truist includes forbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company adopted certain provisions of the CARES Act and other regulatory guidance that provide relief from the requirement to apply TDR accounting to (1) certain modifications of federally backed mortgages upon request from the borrower, and (2) certain modifications of other non-federally backed mortgages for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that were less than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the policies related to TDRs and COVID-19 loan modifications. 

TDRs identified by SunTrust prior to the Merger date are not included in Truist&#8217;s TDR disclosure because all such loans were recorded at fair value and a new accounting basis was established as of the Merger date. Subsequent modifications are evaluated for potential treatment as TDRs in accordance with Truist&#8217;s accounting policies.

At March 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses was $6.0 billion and includes $5.7 billion for loans and leases and $349 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 1.94 percent of loans and leases held for investment compared to 1.95 percent at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan and lease losses covered nonperforming loans and leases held for investment 4.84 times compared to 4.39 times at December 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 5.87 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 7.15 times at December 31, 2020. 

Net charge-offs during the first quarter totaled $238 million, up $33 million compared to the prior quarter. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.33 percent, up six basis points compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily in the indirect auto portfolio due to seasonality. 

The following table presents an allocation of the ALLL. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. Truist estimates second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of March 31, 2021, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 30.2 percent of its second lien positions.

Funding Activities 

Deposits 

The following table presents average deposits: 

Table 18: Average Deposits 

Three Months Ended 

(Dollars in millions) 

Mar 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2020 Sep 30, 2020 Jun 30, 2020 Mar 31, 2020 Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 128,579 $ 127,103 $ 123,966 $ 113,875 $ 93,135 Interest checking 104,744 99,866 96,707 97,863 85,008 Money market and savings 129,303 124,692 123,598 126,071 120,936 Time deposits 20,559 23,605 27,940 33,009 35,570 Total average deposits $ 383,185 $ 375,266 $ 372,211 $ 370,818 $ 334,649 

Average deposits for the first quarter of 2021 were $383.2 billion, an increase of $7.9 billion compared to the prior quarter. Average interest checking and money market and savings deposit growth was strong for the first quarter of 2021 driven by growth resulting from additional government stimulus programs and pandemic-related client behavior. Average noninterest bearing deposits grew 4.7 percent compared to the prior quarter and represented 33.6 percent of total deposits for the first quarter of 2021, compared to 33.9 percent for the prior quarter. 

Average time deposits decreased primarily due to the maturity of wholesale negotiable certificates of deposit and higher-cost personal accounts. 

The cost of average total deposits was 0.05 percent for the first quarter, down two basis points compared to the prior quarter. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 0.07 percent for the first quarter, down four basis points compared to the prior quarter. 

Borrowings 

At March 31, 2021, short-term borrowings totaled $5.9 billion, a decrease of $203 million compared to December 31, 2020, due primarily to a decrease of $649 million in short-term FHLB advances, partially offset by an increase of $272 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 

Average short-term borrowings were $6.7 billion or 1.6 percent of total funding for the first quarter of 2021, as compared to $18.9 billion or 4.7 percent for the prior year. Average short-term borrowings decreased as a percentage of funding sources due to strong deposit growth. Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $37.8 billion at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.8 billion compared to December 31, 2020. During 2021, $3.0 billion of senior notes matured. These maturities were partially offset by issuances of $1.3 billion of senior notes with an interest rate of 1.27 percent maturing in 2027. FHLB advances represented 2.3 percent of total outstanding long-term debt at March 31, 2021, compared to 2.2 percent at December 31, 2020. The average cost of long-term debt was 1.57 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2021, down 77 basis points compared to the same period in 2020. 

In April 2021, Truist redeemed $1.3 billion of fixed rate senior notes due in May 2021. In May 2021, Truist redeemed $250 million of floating rate senior notes due in June 2021. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $67.9 billion at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.0 billion from December 31, 2020. This decrease includes a decrease of $2.2 billion in AOCI, redemptions of $950 million in preferred stock for Series F and G, $722 million in dividends and $506 million in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $1.5 billion in net income available to common shareholders. Truist&#8217;s book value per common share at March 31, 2021 was $45.17, compared to $46.52 at December 31, 2020. 

In connection with the redemptions of preferred stock, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $26 million to recognize the difference between the redemption price and the carrying value. Refer to &#8220;Note 9. Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; for additional disclosures related to preferred stock redemptions. 

Truist has approximately $1.5 billion authorization remaining under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in December 2020. 

In April 2021, the Company announced the redemption of $465 million in preferred stock for Series H.

Risk Management 

Truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner, and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. The risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables Truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the Company faces, both presently and in the future, and the Company&#8217;s position on managing risk to acceptable levels. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Compensation decisions take into account a teammate&#8217;s adherence to and successful implementation of Truist&#8217;s risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company&#8217;s compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage BB&#38;T and heritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive Leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities. 

Refer to Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional disclosures under the section titled &#8220;Risk Management.&#8221; 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices. 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist&#8217;s strategic financial objectives. Truist&#8217;s most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in Truist&#8217;s BUs. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk). 

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

Interest Rate Market Risk 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities. Truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities, and mix, with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible. Truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates. 

Truist Financial Corporation 53 

The Company&#8217;s simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments, and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. These assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to Truist&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The model also considers Truist&#8217;s current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes, and projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance. 

Deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. Truist applies an average deposit beta (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) of approximately 50 percent to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. Truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position. The predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk. 

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below. 

Table 19: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis Interest Rate Scenario Annualized Hypothetical Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Linear Change in Prime Rate (bps) Prime Rate Mar 31, 2021 Mar 31, 2020 Mar 31, 2021 Mar 31, 2020 Up 100 4.25 % 4.25 % 3.74 % 2.56 % Up 50 3.75 3.75 2.92 2.00 No Change 3.25 3.25 &#8212; &#8212; Down 25 (1) 3.00 3.00 (1.32) (2.11) Down 50 (1) 2.75 2.75 (1.75) (3.86) 

(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect Down 25 and 50 basis points for all rate indices. 

Rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods, primarily driven by increased deposits as a result of government stimulus programs. 

Management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. Much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Consistent with the industry, Truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. The behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of Truist. A decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of Truist&#8217;s balance sheet because the Company would increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source. 

The following table shows the results of Truist&#8217;s interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. For purposes of this analysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100 percent. 

Table 20: Deposit Mix Sensitivity Analysis Linear Change in Rates (bps) Base Scenario at March 31, 2021 (1) Results Assuming a Decrease in Noninterest-Bearing Demand Deposits $20 Billion $40 Billion Up 100 3.74 % 2.92 % 2.09 % Up 50 2.92 2.32 1.72 

(1) The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at March 31, 2021 as presented in the preceding table. 

Truist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on longer-term projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. This measure allows Truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments. The difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as EVE. 

54 Truist Financial Corporation 

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on EVE: 

Table 21: EVE Simulation Analysis Change in Interest Rates (bps) Hypothetical Percentage Change in EVE Mar 31, 2021 Mar 31, 2020 Up 100 (2.2) % 4.8 % No Change &#8212; &#8212; Down 100 (1.9) (10.7) 

Truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs, and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt, and other funding sources. Truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. As of March 31, 2021, Truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $311.6 billion, with an associated net fair value of $2.2 billion. See &#8220;Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; for additional disclosures. 

LIBOR in its current form was anticipated to no longer be available after 2021. For most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the administrator of LIBOR is extending publication until June 30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently by Truist, including one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR, are still anticipated to cease publication at December 31, 2021, based on this new guidance. Truist has U.S. dollar LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023. To prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management has formed a cross-functional project team to address the LIBOR transition. The project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR to a new index. The project team provides updates to Executive Leadership and the Board. 

Contract fallback language for existing loans and leases is under review and certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition. Current fallback language used for new, renewed, and modified contracts is generally consistent with ARRC recommendations. Updates to current fallback language will be evaluated according to new regulatory guidance for the extension of timelines for the transition and expectations for production of U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts during 2021. Truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness for the transition. Market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition. For a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of LIBOR and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled &#8220;Item1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, Truist began offering SOFR-based lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients and entered into SOFR-based derivative contracts. Truist expects SOFR to become a more commonly-used pricing benchmark across the industry. Truist continues to evaluate SOFR for additional product offerings and other alternative reference rates as replacements for LIBOR. 

Market risk from trading activities 

As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with Truist&#8217;s risk appetite. 

Truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule. 

Covered Trading Positions 

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the Company&#8217;s clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies and methodologies exist for all covered positions. Additionally, trading positions are subject to independent price verification. See &#8220;Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; &#8220;Note 14. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies. 

Truist Financial Corporation 55 

Securitizations 

As of March 31, 2021, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule was $30 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation Trading Positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of March 31, 2021. 

VaR-Based Measures 

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99 percent confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99 percent confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits. 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Heightened market volatility experienced during March 2020 significantly impacted the year-over-year comparison. 

Table 22: VaR-based Measures Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 (Dollars in millions) 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period VaR-based Measures: Maximum $ 68 $ 16 $ 30 $ 10 Average 39 10 10 3 Minimum 3 3 3 1 Period-end 5 3 19 8 VaR by Risk Class: Interest Rate Risk 2 5 Credit Spread Risk 4 4 Equity Price Risk 1 8 Foreign Exchange Risk &#8212; &#8212; Portfolio Diversification (5) (9) Period-end 3 8 

For most of the first quarter of 2021, the rolling 12-month VaR historic look-back window incorporated the peak March 2020 volatility, which contributed to the increase in Average and Maximum VaR. VaR as of March 31, 2021 declined compared to March 31, 2020 as this volatile period in March 2020 aged out of the 12-month VaR look-back window, partially offset by the normalization of inventory levels in March 2021 compared to March 2020. 

56 Truist Financial Corporation 

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99 percent confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company&#8217;s trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures: 

Table 23: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Maximum $ 72 $ 65 Average 54 33 Minimum 26 16 Period-end 64 19 

The increase from the prior year in stressed VaR-based measures was due to inclusion of volatility levels from March 2020 in the 12-month Stressed VaR window and normalization of market making inventory levels in March 2021 compared to March 2020 when inventory levels were lower due to the market volatility. 

Specific Risk Measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR Model Backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, there were no Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. The total number of Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.

Model Risk Management 

MRM is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRM policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress Testing 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company&#8217;s comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist&#8217;s funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Truist&#8217;s liquid asset buffer, as a percent of total assets, was 23.2 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively. 

The LCR rule directs large U.S. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, as defined under the LCR rule. As of January 1, 2020, Truist is subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist&#8217;s average LCR was 111 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2021, well above the regulatory minimum of 100 percent. 

The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies&#8217; views of the Parent Company&#8217;s and Truist Bank&#8217;s credit quality, liquidity, capital, and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. There were no changes to the ratings of Truist or Truist Bank by the major rating agencies during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. See the &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; section of MD&#38;A in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding credit ratings. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company&#8217;s assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. 

See &#8220;Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Parent Company had 40 months and 43 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 22 months at each such date when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Truist Bank 

Truist carefully manages liquidity risk at Truist Bank. Truist Bank&#8217;s primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. At March 31, 2021, Truist Bank had $203.4 billion of available secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 10.7 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. In addition to secured borrowing sources, Truist had excess eligible cash at the Federal Reserve Bank of $26.8 billion at March 31, 2021. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Refer to Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for discussion with respect to Truist&#8217;s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about its fixed and determinable contractual obligations. Truist&#8217;s commitments include investments in affordable housing projects throughout its market area, renewable energy credits, private equity funds, derivative contracts to manage various financial risks, as well as other commitments. Refer to &#8220;Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; &#8220;Note 14. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; in this Form 10-Q, and &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these commitments. 

Capital 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist&#8217;s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist&#8217;s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. 

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company&#8217;s capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management&#8217;s overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; minimums. Management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist&#8217;s capital plan.

While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the Company temporarily falling below its operating targets for one or more of these ratios, it is management&#8217;s intent to return to these operating targets within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. Such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of Truist&#8217;s overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period. 

Truist has approximately $1.5 billion authorization remaining under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in December 2020. Management&#8217;s intention is to maintain an approximate 10 percent Common Equity Tier 1 ratio after considering strategic actions such as non-bank acquisitions or stock repurchases, as well as changes in risk-weighted assets. For the second quarter of 2021, Truist intends to execute share repurchases consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital restrictions announced on March 25, 2021. In addition to these restrictions, any future stock repurchase activity will be informed by economic and regulatory considerations, as well as Truist&#8217;s capital position, dividends, earnings outlook, and capital deployment priorities. 

Truist&#8217;s capital ratios are presented in the following table: 

Table 25: Capital Ratios - Truist Financial Corporation (Dollars in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands) Mar 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2020 Risk-based: (preliminary) &#160; CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.1 % 10.0 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 12.0 12.1 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 14.3 14.5 Leverage ratio 9.4 9.6 Supplementary leverage ratio 8.3 8.7 Non-GAAP capital measure (1): &#160; &#160; Tangible common equity per common share $ 25.53 $ 26.78 Calculation of tangible common equity (1): &#160; &#160; Total shareholders&#8217; equity $ 67,876 $ 70,912 Less: &#160; &#160; Preferred stock 7,124 8,048 Noncontrolling interests &#8212; 105 Goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred taxes 26,413 26,629 Tangible common equity $ 34,339 $ 36,130 Risk-weighted assets $ 378,522 $ 379,153 Common shares outstanding at end of period 1,344,845 1,348,961 

(1) Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist&#8217;s management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Capital ratios remained strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks. Truist declared common dividends of $0.45 per share during the first quarter of 2021 and completed $506 million of share repurchases. The dividend and total payout ratios for the first quarter of 2021 were 45.4 percent and 83.3 percent, respectively. Truist also redeemed $950 million of preferred stock during the quarter to optimize the Company&#8217;s capital position. In connection with the redemptions of preferred stock, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $26 million to recognize the difference between the redemption price and the carrying value.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist&#8217;s financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations, and related disclosures. The more critical policies include accounting for the ACL, determining fair value of financial instruments, intangible assets, income taxes, and benefit obligations associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans. Understanding Truist&#8217;s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&#38;A in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additional disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in the &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; included herein. Except for the item noted below, there have been no other changes to the significant accounting policies during 2021. 

Intangible Assets 

The Company performed a qualitative assessment of current events and circumstances during the first quarter of 2021, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Truist specific performance indicators, and a comparison of management&#8217;s forecast and assumptions to those used in its October 1, 2020 quantitative impairment test, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of March 31, 2021, and therefore no triggering event occurred that required a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If economic conditions deteriorate, or the pandemic&#8217;s effects prolong or worsen, it may be more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of Truist&#8217;s reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount, which would require a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
