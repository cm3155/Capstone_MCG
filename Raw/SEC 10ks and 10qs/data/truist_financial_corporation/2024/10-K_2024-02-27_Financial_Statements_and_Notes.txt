 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Truist Financial Corporation 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Truist Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Certain Commercial, Consumer, and Credit Card Portfolios 

As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected future credit losses related to loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s consolidated ACL balance was $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, including $2.2 billion for commercial portfolios, $2.2 billion for consumer portfolios, and $0.4 billion for credit card. As disclosed by management, estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management&#8217;s judgment. The ACL estimation process includes both quantitatively calculated components as well as qualitative components. Quantitative models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default, and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The models are generally applied to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The macroeconomic forecast data used in the quantitative models is based on forecasted variables for a reasonable and supportable period. The qualitative components of the ACL incorporate management&#8217;s judgment in determining qualitative adjustments where model outputs are inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations with respect to expected credit losses. The qualitative components are used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to current economic conditions, and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the ACL for certain commercial, consumer, and credit card portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company&#8217;s ACL estimation process for certain commercial, consumer, and credit card portfolios, which included controls related to the quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining the ACL for certain commercial, consumer, and credit card portfolios quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments, which included evaluating the appropriateness of the quantitative models and management&#8217;s methodology, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in determining the quantitative model results and certain qualitative adjustments, and evaluating the reasonableness of judgments used by management in determining certain qualitative adjustments. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the quantitative models and (ii) the reasonableness of judgments used by management in determining certain qualitative adjustments. 

Goodwill Impairment Analyses &#8211; CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB Reporting Units 

As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s consolidated goodwill balance was $20.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. The goodwill associated with the Consumer Banking and Wealth (CB&#38;W) and Corporate and Commercial Banking (C&#38;CB) reporting units was $13.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As disclosed by management, management performs a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. The quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and a market based approach. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and required capital. The market based approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable. 

88 Truist Financial Corporation 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment analyses of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value estimate of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units using the income approach and market based approach; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to net interest margin, noninterest expense, and the discount rates used in the income approach and the key valuation multiples and market control premiums used in the market based approach; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s goodwill impairment analyses, which included controls related to the valuation of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining the fair value estimate of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units, which included evaluating the appropriateness of management&#8217;s income approach and market based approach, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the income approach and market based approach, and evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to net interest margin, noninterest expense, and the discount rates used in the income approach and the key valuation multiples and market control premiums used in the market based approach. Evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions related to net interest margin and noninterest expense involved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units and (ii) the consistency with external data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the income approach and the market based approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the net interest margin and discount rate assumptions used in the income approach and the key valuation multiples and market control premium assumptions used in the market based approach.

NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation 

Truist Financial Corporation is a purpose-driven financial services company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. As a leading U.S. commercial bank, Truist has leading market share in many of the high-growth markets across the country. Truist offers a wide range of products and services through our wholesale and consumer businesses, including consumer and small business banking, commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, insurance, wealth management, payments, and specialized lending businesses. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist is a top-10 commercial bank. In 2023, the Company operated and measured business activity across three business segments: Consumer Banking and Wealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Insurance Holdings. These segments are being realigned in the first quarter of 2024. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s business segments and their realignment, see &#8220;Note 21. Operating Segments.&#8221; 

General 

See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this Report for terms used herein. The accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Truist Financial Corporation and those subsidiaries that are wholly or majority owned by Truist or over which Truist has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of companies and net assets acquired are included from the date of acquisition. Results of operations associated with entities or net assets sold are included through the date of disposition. 

Truist holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are legal entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to independently finance its activities, or as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 

Investments in VIEs are evaluated to determine if Truist is the primary beneficiary. This evaluation gives appropriate consideration to the design of the entity and the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along, the relative power of each party, and to Truist&#8217;s obligation to absorb losses or receive residual returns of the entity. For changes in facts and circumstances, Truist re-assesses whether or not it is a primary beneficiary of a VIE. Truist has variable interests in certain entities that are not required to be consolidated. Refer to &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional disclosures regarding Truist&#8217;s VIEs. 

Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financing decisions are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, adjusted to reflect the Company&#8217;s portion of income, loss, or dividends of the investee. Truist records its portion of income or loss in Other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These investments are periodically evaluated for impairment. 

The Company reports any noncontrolling interests in its subsidiaries in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and separately presents the income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of a consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Reclassifications 

In 2023, Truist reclassified certain portfolios within the consumer portfolio segment to delineate home equity from other consumer portfolios. Additionally, Truist realigned Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation, which includes AFCO Credit Corporation and CAFO Holding Company, into the C&#38;CB segment from the IH segment. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the current presentation. 

In 2023, Truist updated its segment cost allocation methodology. Results for 2023 have been revised to conform to the current presentation. Management concluded the impact to 2022 was not material. 

Certain other amounts reported in prior periods&#8217; consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

Truist Financial Corporation 95 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACL; determination of fair value for securities, MSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative assets and liabilities; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and pension and postretirement benefit obligations. 

Business Combinations 

Truist accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks that have original maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. Restricted cash was immaterial at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Securities Financing Activities 

Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were borrowed or purchased. On the acquisition date of these securities, the Company and related counterparty agree on the amount of collateral required to secure the principal amount loaned under these agreements. The Company monitors collateral values daily and calls for additional collateral to be provided as warranted under the respective agreements. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold. The Company monitors collateral values daily and pledges collateral as warranted under the respective agreements. 

Trading Activities 

Various trading assets and liabilities are used to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of the Company&#8217;s clients. Product offerings to clients include debt securities, loans traded in the secondary market, equity securities, derivative contracts, and other similar financial instruments. The Company elects to apply fair value accounting to trading loans. Trading loans include: (i) loans held in connection with the Company&#8217;s trading business primarily consisting of commercial and corporate leveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii) loans made or acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business. Other trading-related activities include acting as a market maker for certain debt and equity security transactions, derivative instrument transactions, and foreign exchange transactions. Trading assets and liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized within Noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income on trading account securities is included in Interest on other earning assets. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s trading activities, see &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; and &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

Investment Securities 

The Company invests in various debt securities primarily for liquidity management purposes and as part of the overall ALM process to optimize income and market performance. Investments in debt securities that are not held for trading purposes are classified as HTM or AFS. 

Interest income on securities is recognized in income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the security. As prepayments are received, a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. 

Debt securities are classified as HTM when Truist has both the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. HTM securities are reported at amortized cost. AFS securities are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI, net of deferred income taxes, in the Shareholders&#8217; equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses realized from the sale of AFS securities are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income. 

96 Truist Financial Corporation 

An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated at the balance sheet date to determine whether such losses are credit-related. Credit related losses are measured on an individual basis and recognized in an ACL. Changes in expected credit losses are recognized in the Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Municipal securities are evaluated for impairment using a municipal bond credit scoring tool that leverages historical municipal market data to estimate probability of default and loss given default at the issuer level. U.S. Treasury securities, government guaranteed securities, and other securities issued by GSEs are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Non-agency MBS in the portfolio reflect recent issuances that are highly rated, include excess collateral and are collateralized by loans to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan to value ratios. Truist utilizes cash flow modeling for the evaluation of potential credit impairment on non-agency securities in an unrealized loss position. Cash flow modeling incorporates a variety of factors that impact the long-term expectation of collateral performance. Impairment is attributable to factors other than credit when there continues to be an expectation of the collection of all contractual principal and interest. 

Related to any unrealized losses reported in AOCI, Truist considers any intent to sell and whether it was more-likely-than-not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis as of the reporting date. 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities that are not classified as trading assets or liabilities are recorded in Other assets on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are considered marketable and measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized as a component of Other noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable equity securities include mutual fund investments and other publicly traded equity securities. Dividends received from marketable equity securities and FHLB stock are recognized within Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity securities that are not accounted for under the equity method and that do not have readily determinable fair values are considered non-marketable and are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Any adjustments to the carrying value of these non-marketable equity securities are recognized in Other noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-marketable equity securities include FHLB stock and other equity investments. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s equity securities, see &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

LHFS 

LHFS includes primarily residential mortgage and commercial mortgage loans that management intends to sell in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS also includes specifically identified loans where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. 

The Company elects to apply fair value accounting to residential and commercial mortgage loans that are originated with the intent to be sold in the secondary market. Direct loan origination fees associated with these loans are recorded as Mortgage banking income. The majority of direct origination costs are recorded in Personnel expense. The fair value of these loans is derived from observable current market prices when available and includes loan servicing value. When observable market prices are not available, the Company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. 

First lien residential mortgage LHFS are transferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE securitization transactions, whereby the loans are exchanged for cash or securities that are readily redeemable for cash with servicing rights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale of residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at inception of the associated interest rate lock commitments and reflect the change in value of the loans resulting from changes in interest rates from the time the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with borrowers until the loans are sold, adjusted for pull through rates and excluding hedge transactions initiated to mitigate this market risk. Commercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and FHLMC and the Company also issues and sells GNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured loans. The loans and securities are exchanged for cash with servicing rights retained. Gains and losses on sales of residential and commercial mortgages are included in Mortgage banking income and gains and losses on sales of other consumer loans are included in Other income. 

In certain circumstances, the Company may transfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At the time of transfer, the loans are recorded at LOCOM and charge-offs are recorded as necessary at the transfer date. Subsequent to the initial transfer to LHFS these assets are revalued at each subsequent reporting date, and any resulting adjustments are reported as changes to a valuation allowance, which is recorded as a component of Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s LHFS, see &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

Truist Financial Corporation 97 

Specifically identified LHFS, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale, are recorded at LOCOM. Origination fees and costs for such loans are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized losses resulting from changes in fair value and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the loans are classified as Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available, but may also incorporate consideration of other unobservable inputs such as indicative bids, broker price opinions or other information derived from internal or external data sources. 

Loans and Leases 

The Company&#8217;s accounting methods for loans differ depending on whether the loans are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since the date of origination such that at the date of acquisition there is more than an insignificant deterioration in credit. 

Unearned income, discounts, and net deferred loan fees and costs include direct costs associated with loan origination as well as premiums and discounts from origination or purchase, which are deferred and amortized over the respective loan terms. 

Originated Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest and fees on loans and leases includes certain loan fees and deferred direct costs associated with the lending process recognized over the contractual lives of the loans using the effective interest method for amortizing loans or straight-line method for loans with interest-only repayment terms or revolving privileges. 

Purchased Loans 

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. Purchased loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either PCD, which indicates that the loan reflects more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, or non-PCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in connection with the identification of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality, including but not limited to risk grades, delinquency, nonperforming status, previous reportable loan modifications, bankruptcies, and other qualitative factors that indicate deterioration in credit quality since origination. 

Fair values for purchased loans in a business combination are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers credit loss expectations, market interest, rates, and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions are informed by comparable internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate are determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of the underlying loans. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rates do not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. 

For PCD loans, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment and recognized as an adjustment to the acquisition price of the asset; thus, the sum of the loans&#8217; purchase price and initial ALLL estimate represents the initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value is the non-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD loans, the difference between the fair value and the par value is considered the fair value mark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is recorded with a corresponding charge to the Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent changes in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD loans are recognized in the Provision for credit losses. 

The non-credit discount or premium related to PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans are amortized or accreted to Interest and fees on loans and leases over the contractual life of the loans using the effective interest method for amortizing loans, and using a straight-line approach for loans with interest-only repayment terms or revolving privileges. In the event of prepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums are recognized in Interest and fees on loans and leases.

Loan Modifications 

In certain circumstances, the Company enters into agreements to modify the terms of loans to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. The scope of these loan modifications varies from portfolio to portfolio but generally falls into one of the following categories: 

&#8226; Renewals: represent the renewal of a loan where the Company has concluded that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Commercial renewals result in an extension of the maturity date of the loan (or in some cases a contraction of the loan term), and other significant terms of the loan (e.g., interest rate, collateral, guarantor support, etc.) are re-evaluated in connection with the renewal event. 

&#8226; Term extensions: represent an adjustment to the maturity date of the loan that typically results in a reduction to the borrower&#8217;s scheduled payment over the remainder of the loan. 

&#8226; Capitalizations: represents the capitalization of forborne loan payments and/or other amounts advanced on behalf of the borrower into the principal balance of a residential mortgage loan. 

&#8226; Payment delays: provide the borrower with a temporary postponement of loan payments that is considered other-than-insignificant, which has been defined as a payment delay that exceeds 90 days, or three payment cycles, over a rolling 12-month period. These postponed loan payments may result in an extension of the ultimate maturity date of the loan or may be capitalized into the principal balance of the loan in certain circumstances. 

&#8226; Combinations: in certain circumstances more than one type of a modification is provided to a borrower (e.g., interest rate reduction and term extension). 

&#8226; Other: represents other types of loan modifications that are not considered significant for disclosure purposes. 

The Company has identified borrowers that are included in the Loan Modifications disclosures in &#8220;Note 5. Loans and ACL&#8221; as follows: 

&#8226; Commercial: the Company evaluates all modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are rated substandard or worse and includes the modifications in its disclosure to the extent that the modification is considered other-than-insignificant. 

&#8226; Consumer and credit card: loan modifications to consumer and credit card borrowers are generally limited to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. As a result, the Company evaluates all modifications of consumer and credit card loans and includes them in the disclosure to the extent that they are considered other-than insignificant. 

TDRs 

Prior to January 1, 2023, modifications to a borrower&#8217;s debt agreement were considered TDRs if a concession was granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties that otherwise would not be considered. TDRs were undertaken to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan and took the form of modifications that result in the stated interest rate of the loan being lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in certain limited circumstances, forgiveness of principal or interest. A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant was not considered an economic concession. 

TDRs were classified as performing or nonperforming, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower and an evaluation as to whether the borrower was able to repay the loan based on the modified terms. In circumstances where the TDR involved charging off a portion of the loan balance, Truist classified these TDRs as nonperforming. 

The decision to maintain commercial TDRs on performing status was based on a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrowers&#8217; financial condition and prospects for repayment under the modified terms. This evaluation included consideration of the borrower&#8217;s current capacity to pay, which among other things may include a review of the borrower&#8217;s current financial statements, an analysis of cash flow available to pay debt obligations, and an evaluation of secondary sources of payment from the borrower and any guarantors. This evaluation also included an evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s willingness to pay, which could include a review of past payment history, an evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s willingness to provide information on a timely basis, and consideration of offers from the borrower to provide additional collateral or guarantor support. The credit evaluation could also include review of cash flow projections, consideration of the adequacy of collateral to cover all principal and interest and trends indicating improving profitability and collectability of receivables. 

The evaluation of mortgage and other consumer loans included an evaluation of the client&#8217;s debt-to-income ratio, credit report, property value and certain other client-specific factors that impact the clients&#8217; ability to make timely principal and interest payments on the loan.

NPAs 

NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of clients&#8217; loan defaults. Truist&#8217;s policies for placing loans on nonperforming status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due. The following table summarizes the delinquency thresholds that are a factor used in evaluating nonperforming classification and the timing of charge-off evaluations: ##TABLE_START (number of days) Placed on Nonperforming (1)(2)

(1) Loans may be returned to performing status when (i) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments, (ii) management concludes that all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment, and (iii) there is a sustained period of repayment performance, generally a minimum of six months . 

(2) The timing of nonaccrual and charge-off evaluations are accelerated in circumstances where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. 

(3) Or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, whichever occurs first. 

(4) Depends on product type, loss mitigation status, status of the government guaranty, if applicable, and certain other product-specific factors. 

(5) Student loans are not placed in nonperforming status, which reflects consideration of governmental guarantees or accelerated charge-off policies related to certain non-guaranteed portfolios. 

(6) Government guaranteed loans are considered to be in default once they reach 270 days past due and claims are generally filed once the loans reach 365 days past due. The non-guaranteed balance, which ranges from 2-3%, is charged off once the claim proceeds related to the guaranteed portion have been received, which typically occurs no later than 365 days past due. 

(7) Credit cards are generally not placed on nonperforming status, but are fully charged off at specified delinquency dates consistent with regulatory guidelines. 

When commercial loans are placed on nonperforming status, management evaluates whether a charge-off must be recorded. For collateral-dependent loans, this evaluation is based on a comparison of the loan&#8217;s carrying value to the value of the related collateral, while for non-collateral dependent loans, this evaluation reflects management&#8217;s conclusions with regard to whether any portion of the loan is considered uncollectible. Consumer and credit card loans are subject to charge-off at a specified delinquency date consistent with regulatory guidelines. 

Certain past due loans may remain on performing status if management determines that it does not have concern over the collectability of principal and interest. Generally, when loans are placed on nonperforming status, accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period and amortization of deferred loan fees and expenses for originated loans, and fair value marks for purchased loans, is suspended. For commercial loans and certain consumer loans, payments received for interest and lending fees thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as concern exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. Interest income on nonperforming loans is recognized after the principal has been reduced to zero. If and when borrowers demonstrate the ability to repay a loan classified as nonperforming in accordance with its contractual terms, the loan may be returned to performing status upon meeting all regulatory, accounting and internal policy requirements. 

Accrued interest is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued interest receivable balances are not considered in connection with the ACL estimation process, as such amounts are generally reversed against interest income when the loan is placed in nonperforming status. 

Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated cost to sell, and subsequently carried at LOCOM. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic revaluations of the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. Truist&#8217;s policies require that valuations be updated at least annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than 12 months old, otherwise an update is required. Any subsequent changes in value as well as gains or losses from the disposition of these assets are recognized in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s loan and lease activities, see &#8220;Note 5. Loans and ACL.&#8221;

ACL 

The ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected future credit losses related to loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. The ALLL represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected future credit losses related to its loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s ALLL estimation process gives consideration to relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This estimation process includes both quantitatively calculated components as well as qualitative components. Loss estimates are informed by historical loss experience that includes losses incurred on loans that were previously modified by the Company. As a result, the Company has concluded that aside from the limited circumstances where principal forgiveness is granted to a borrower, the financial effect of loan modifications is already inherently included in the ALLL. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off are incorporated into the ALLL estimate, with such amounts capped at the aggregate of amounts previously charged off. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to the Provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The RUFC is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Portfolio segments represent the level at which Truist develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. Truist&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio consists of three portfolio segments: commercial, consumer, and credit card. The expected credit loss models are generally developed one level below the portfolio segment level. In certain instances, loans and leases are further disaggregated by similar risk characteristics, such as business sector, client type, funding type, and type of collateral. Larger loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics or that are considered collateral-dependent are individually evaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any. Such estimates may be based on current loss forecasts, an evaluation of the fair value of the underlying collateral or in certain circumstances the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate as described further below. 

Truist maintains a collectively calculated ALLL for loans with similar risk characteristics. The collectively calculated ALLL is estimated using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Truist maintains quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses. The credit loss forecasting models use portfolio balances, macroeconomic forecast data, portfolio composition and loan attributes as the primary inputs. Loss estimates are informed by historical loss experience adjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and current and expected portfolio risk characteristics. Expected losses are estimated through the contractual maturity of the loan unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable. In circumstances where an obligation is in a default state, the best estimate of the expected loss at the balance sheet date may be based on modeled losses that occur after the contractual maturity date of the obligation. Prior to January 1, 2023, the loss forecasting models captured losses after the maturity date of the loan for loans that were reasonably expected to be modified as a TDR. 

The Scenario Committee provides guidance, selection, and approval for Company-sanctioned macroeconomic forecast data, including the macroeconomic forecast data for use in the ACL process. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third-party macroeconomic forecast data across scenarios adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years. Assumptions revert to long term historic averages gradually over a one-year period. Macroeconomic forecast data used in estimating the expected losses vary by loan portfolio and include employment factors, estimated collateral values, and market indicators as described by portfolio segment below. 

The qualitative components of the ALLL estimation process incorporate management judgement in determining qualitative adjustments for circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations with respect to expected credit losses. The qualitative components are used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions, and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models. 

The methodology for determining the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the funded component of the ALLL and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. 

The ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The ACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and may recommend adjustments where necessary based on portfolio performance and other items that may impact credit risk. 

The following provides a description of accounting policies, methodologies, and credit quality indicators related to each of the portfolio segments: 

Truist Financial Corporation 101 

Commercial 

The majority of loans in the commercial lending portfolio are assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing borrowers&#8217; financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower. Risk ratings are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently for many relationships based on the policy requirements regarding various risk characteristics. While this review is largely focused on the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, Truist also considers the capacity and willingness of a loan&#8217;s guarantors to support the loan as a secondary source of repayment. When a guarantor exhibits the documented capacity and willingness to support the loan, Truist may consider extending the loan maturity and/or temporarily deferring principal payments if the ultimate collection of both principal and interest is reasonably assured. In these cases, Truist may determine the loan is not impaired due to the documented capacity and willingness of the guarantor to repay the loan. Loans are considered impaired when the borrower (or guarantor in certain circumstances) does not have the cash flow capacity or willingness to service the debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that the borrower will continue to pay according to the contractual agreement. The following table summarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to monitor credit quality in its commercial portfolio: ##TABLE_START Risk Rating Description Pass Loans not considered to be problem credits Special Mention Loans that have a potential weakness deserving management&#8217;s close attention Substandard Loans for which a well-defined weakness has been identified that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk Nonperforming Loans for which full collection of principal and interest is not considered probable ##TABLE_END 

Loans are generally pooled one level below the portfolio segment for the collectively calculated ALLL based on factors such as business sector, project and property type, line of business, collateral, loan type, obligor exposure, and risk grade or score. Commercial loss forecasting systems of models use macroeconomic forecast data across scenarios and current portfolio attributes as inputs. The models forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The primary macroeconomic drivers for the commercial portfolios include unemployment trends, U.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads, and property values. 

Truist&#8217;s policy is to review and individually evaluate the reserve for all lending relationships where non-performing exposure exceeds $ 5 million. Prior to January 1, 2023, Truist included TDRs, whether performing or non-performing, to the extent that they exceeded $ 5 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, Truist only includes non-performing loans greater than $ 5 million or more, as such lending relationships do not typically share similar risk characteristics with others. Individually evaluated reserves are based on current forecasts, the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, or the value of collateral, which is generally based on appraisals, recent sales of foreclosed properties and/or relevant property-specific market information. Truist has elected to measure expected credit losses on collateral-dependent loans based on the fair value of the collateral. Loans are considered collateral dependent when it is probable that Truist will be unable to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the agreement and repayment is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or continued operation of the underlying collateral. Commercial loans are typically secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories, and other types of collateral. 

Consumer and Credit Card 

The ALLL related to the consumer and credit card lending portfolios is generally calculated on a collective basis. Loans are pooled one level below the portfolio segment for the collectively calculated ALLL based on factors such as collateral, loan type, line of business, and sales channel. Consumer portfolio models use macroeconomic forecast data across scenarios and current portfolio attributes as inputs. The models forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The primary macroeconomic drivers for the consumer portfolios include unemployment trends, home price indices, and used car prices. 

Residential mortgages and revolving home equity lines of credit are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. The indirect auto and other consumer portfolios include secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. The student loan portfolio was composed of government guaranteed student loans and certain private student loans. The government guarantee mitigated substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. The credit card portfolio and certain other consumer payment solution businesses within the other consumer portfolios are generally unsecured and are actively managed. 

Truist uses delinquency status to monitor credit quality in its consumer and credit card portfolios. Delinquency status is the primary factor considered in determining whether a loan should be classified as nonperforming. 

102 Truist Financial Corporation 

Prior to January 1, 2023 the ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is based on analyses capturing the expected credit losses and the impact of the concessions over the remaining life of the assets. 

Expected recoveries for loans are included in the estimation of the ALLL based on historical experience. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises, equipment, finance leases, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and are recorded within the corresponding Noninterest expense categories on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the improvements&#8217; estimated useful lives or the lease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived asset or asset group, including premises and equipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. 

Lessee operating and finance leases 

Truist has operating and finance leases for data centers, corporate offices, branches, retail centers, and certain equipment. Operating leases with an original lease term in excess of one year are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Premises and equipment and Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease costs are recorded in Net occupancy expense or Equipment expense based on the underlying asset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate in determining the present value of lease payments when readily determinable, and a collateralized incremental borrowing rate when an implicit rate is not available. Lease terms consider options to extend or terminate based on the determination of whether such renewal or termination options are deemed reasonably certain. 

Lease agreements that contain non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component. Variable costs, such as maintenance expenses, property and sales taxes, association dues and index-based rate increases, are expensed as they are incurred. 

The impairment policy for a ROU asset is discussed within the Premises and Equipment section above. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

Life insurance policies on certain current and former directors, officers and teammates, for which Truist is the owner and beneficiary are stated at the cash surrender value within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in cash surrender value and proceeds from insurance benefits are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These policies provide the Company an efficient form of funding for retirement and other employee benefits costs. See &#8220;Note 9. Other Assets and Liabilities&#8221; for additional information. 

Income Taxes 

The Company&#8217;s provision for income taxes is based on income and expense reported for financial statement purposes after adjustments for permanent differences such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities, tax credits, and amortization expense related to qualified tax credit investments. In computing the provision for income taxes, the Company evaluates the technical merits of its income tax positions based on current legislative, judicial, and regulatory guidance. The proportional amortization method of accounting is used on affordable housing and other qualified tax credit investments, such that the initial cost of the investment giving rise to tax credits is amortized in proportion to the allocation of tax credits and other income tax benefits in each period as a component of the provision for income taxes. Truist includes the initial investment cash flows and subsequent credits within operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additionally, the Company recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies on employee share-based payments as a component of the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These tax effects, generally determined upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of equity compensation awards, are treated as discrete items in the period in which they occur. For additional information related to the Company&#8217;s unrealized gains and losses, see &#8220;Note 13. AOCI.&#8221; 

DTAs and DTLs result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. These deferred assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to apply in the periods in which the DTAs or DTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these deferred assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the Provision for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. 

Truist Financial Corporation 103 

Interest and penalties related to the Company&#8217;s tax positions are recognized in the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s activities related to income taxes, see &#8220;Note 14. Income Taxes.&#8221; 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company records derivative contracts at fair value in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether or not it has been designated in a formal, qualifying hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized within Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This includes derivatives that the Company enters into in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions and as a risk management tool to economically hedge certain identified risks associated with assets carried at fair value such as MSRs, along with certain interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage and commercial loans that are a normal part of the Company&#8217;s operations. The Company also evaluates its financial contracts to determine whether any embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for as freestanding derivatives. 

Certain derivatives used as risk management tools are designated as accounting hedges and are used to mitigate the Company&#8217;s exposure to changes in interest rates or other identified market risks. The Company prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges of (i) changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge) attributable to a specified risk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item, and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness, along with support for management&#8217;s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. Methodologies related to hedge effectiveness include (i) statistical regression analysis of changes in the cash flows of the actual derivative and hypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical regression analysis of changes in the fair values of the actual derivative and the hedged item. 

For designated hedging relationships, the Company generally performs subsequent assessments of hedge effectiveness using a qualitative approach. 

Below is a summary of the cash flow and fair value hedge programs utilized by Truist: ##TABLE_START Cash Flow Hedges Fair Value Hedges Risk exposure 

Variability in cash flows of interest payments on floating rate loans, overnight funding, and various SOFR and other funding instruments. 

Changes in value on fixed rate long-term debt, FHLB advances, loans and AFS securities due to changes in interest rates. Risk management objective Hedge the variability in the interest payments and receipts on future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the first unhedged payments and receipts of variable interest due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. Convert the fixed rate paid or received to a floating rate, primarily through the use of swaps. Treatment during the hedge period Changes in value of the hedging instruments are recognized in AOCI until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. The amount reclassified to earnings is recorded in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Changes in value of both the hedging instruments and the assets or liabilities being hedged are recognized in the income statement line item associated with the asset or liability being hedged. Treatment if hedge ceases to be highly effective or is terminated Hedge is dedesignated. Changes in value recorded in AOCI before dedesignation are amortized to yield over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If hedged item remains outstanding, the basis adjustment that resulted from hedging is amortized into earnings through the maturity date of the instrument, and cash flows from terminated hedges are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item. Treatment if transaction is no longer probable of occurring during forecast period or within a short period thereafter Hedge accounting ceases and any gain or loss in AOCI is recognized in earnings immediately. Not applicable ##TABLE_END

104 Truist Financial Corporation 

Derivatives expose the Company to risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract does not perform as expected. The Company manages its exposures to counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with defined exposure limits based on their credit quality and in accordance with established policies and procedures. All counterparties are reviewed regularly as part of the Company&#8217;s credit risk management practices and appropriate action is taken to adjust the exposure limits to certain counterparties as necessary. The Company&#8217;s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA agreements or other legally enforceable industry standard master netting agreements. In certain cases and depending on the nature of the underlying derivative transactions, bilateral collateral agreements are also utilized. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to OTC derivative clearing requirements, which require certain derivatives to be cleared through central clearing houses. These clearing houses require the Company to post initial and variation margin to mitigate the risk of non-payment, the latter of which is received or paid daily based on the net asset or liability of the contracts. The Company applies settlement to market treatment for the cash collateralizing derivative contracts with certain centrally cleared counterparties. 

When the Company has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, and there exists a legal right of setoff with that counterparty, the Company considers its exposure to the counterparty to be the net fair value of its derivative positions with that counterparty. If the net fair value is positive, then the corresponding asset value also reflects cash collateral held. The Company offsets derivative transactions with a single counterparty as well as any cash collateral paid to and received from that counterparty for derivative contracts that are subject to ISDA or other legally enforceable netting arrangements and meet accounting guidance for offsetting treatment. 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivative activities, see &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; and &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.&#8221; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as business combinations. Truist allocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. 

The goodwill of each reporting unit is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. If, after assessing all relevant events or circumstances, Truist concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value, then a quantitative impairment test is required. Truist may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, then there is no impairment. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. 

The quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income and market-based approaches. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions. The market based approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable. Truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of historic bank control premiums and the current market. 

CDI and other intangible assets include premiums paid for acquisitions of core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, are amortized over their useful lives, based upon the estimated economic benefits received. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s activities related to goodwill and other intangibles, see &#8220;Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#8221; 

Truist Financial Corporation 105 

Loan Servicing Rights 

Truist has three classes of servicing rights for which it separately manages the economic risks: residential MSRs, commercial MSRs, and other loan servicing rights. Loan servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Mortgage banking income and Other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of servicing rights is impacted by a variety of factors, including prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually specified servicing fees, servicing costs, and underlying portfolio characteristics. These risks are hedged with various derivative instruments that are intended to mitigate the income statement effect to changes in fair value. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties and comparisons to market transactions. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s servicing rights, see &#8220;Note 8. Loan Servicing.&#8221; 

Fair Value Measurement 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value. The Company classifies inputs used in valuation techniques within the fair value hierarchy discussed in &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

When measuring assets and liabilities at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis include trading securities, derivative instruments, AFS securities, and certain other equity securities. Assets and liabilities that the Company has elected to measure at fair value on a recurring basis include trading loans, loans originated to be sold and classified as LHFS, and loan servicing rights. Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as when assets are evaluated for impairment, and subsequently carried at LOCOM. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s valuation of assets and liabilities held at fair value, see &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

Equity-Based Compensation 

Truist maintains various equity-based compensation plans that provide for the granting of RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs to selected teammates and directors. Truist values share-based awards at the grant date fair value and recognizes the expense over the requisite service period taking into account retirement eligibility. Compensation expense is recognized in Personnel expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation plans, see &#8220;Note 15. Benefit Plans.&#8221; 

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 

Truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an AA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests, adjusted for the weight of each asset class in the target mix. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, see &#8220;Note 15. Benefit Plans.&#8221; 

Revenue Recognition 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company recognizes two primary types of revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Income, Interest income, and Noninterest income. The Company&#8217;s principal source of revenue is Interest income from loans and securities, which is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. For information on the Company&#8217;s policies for recognizing Interest income on loans and securities, see the &#8220;Loans and Leases,&#8221; &#8220;LHFS,&#8221; &#8220;Trading Activities,&#8221; and &#8220;Investment Securities&#8221; sections within this Note. 

Noninterest income includes revenue from various types of transactions and services provided to clients. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers as performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligations are typically satisfied in one year or less. Truist elected the practical expedient to expense the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, remaining performance obligations consisted primarily of insurance and investment banking services for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Insurance income 

Insurance commissions are received on the sale of insurance products as agent or broker, and revenue is recognized at a point in time upon the placement date of the insurance policies, representing the Company&#8217;s related performance obligations. Payment is normally received within the policy period. In addition to placement, Truist also provides insurance policy related risk management services. The Company&#8217;s execution of these risk management services represents its performance obligations. Revenue is recognized over time as these services are provided. Performance-based commissions are recognized when received or earlier when, upon consideration of past results and current conditions, the revenue is deemed not probable of reversal. Insurance commissions are included in the IH operating segment. Refer to &#8220;Note 21. Operating Segments&#8221; for information on segment results. 

Transaction and service-based revenues 

Transaction and service-based revenues include Wealth management income, Investment banking income, Service charges on deposits, and Card and payment related fees. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the transactions occur or over time as services are performed primarily over monthly or quarterly periods. Payment is typically received in the period the transactions occur or, in some cases, within 90 days of the service period. Fees may be fixed or, where applicable, based on a percentage of transaction size or managed assets. These revenues, and their relationship to the Company&#8217;s operating segments, are further described by type below. Refer to &#8220;Note 21. Operating Segments&#8221; for information on segment results. 

Wealth management income includes trust and investment management income, retail investment and brokerage services, and investment advisory and other specialty wealth management fees. The Company&#8217;s execution of these services represents its related performance obligations. The Company generally recognizes trust and investment management and advisory revenue over time as services are rendered based on either a percentage of the market value of the assets under management or advisement, or fixed based on the services provided to the client. Fees are generally swept from the client&#8217;s account either in advance of or in arrears based on the prior period&#8217;s asset balances under management or advisement. The Company also offers selling and distribution services and earns commissions through the sale of annuity and mutual fund products, acting as agent in these transactions and recognizing revenue at a point in time when the client enters into an agreement with the product carrier. The Company may also receive trailing commissions and 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and annuity products and recognizes this revenue in the period earned. Retail trade execution commissions are earned and recognized on the trade date with payment on the settlement date. Wealth management income is included in the CB&#38;W operating segment. 

Investment banking and trading income includes securities underwriting fees, advisory fees, loan syndication fees, structured real estate income, and trade execution services revenue. Underwriting fees are earned on the trade date when the Company, as a member of an underwriting syndicate, purchases the securities from the issuer and sells the securities to third-party investors. Each member of the syndicate is responsible for selling its portion of the underwriting and is liable for the proportionate costs of the underwriting; therefore, the Company&#8217;s portion of underwriting revenue and expense is presented gross within noninterest income and noninterest expense. The transaction price is based on a percentage of the total transaction amount and payments are settled shortly after the trade date. Fees for merger and acquisition advisory services, including various activities such as business valuation, identification of potential targets or acquirers, and the issuance of fairness opinions, are generally earned and recognized by the Company when performance obligations are satisfied. The Company&#8217;s execution of the advisory services related to these fees represents its performance obligations. The Company is the principal when rendering these services. The transaction price is based on contractually specified terms agreed upon with the client for each advisory service. Loan syndication fees are typically recognized at the closing of a loan syndication transaction. Structured real estate income is recognized when an existing build-to-suit or sale-leaseback asset is sold. The proceeds, net of closing costs, are reduced by the carrying value of the underlying leased asset. Revenue related to corporate trade execution services is earned and recognized on the trade date with payment on the settlement date. Investment banking and trading income is included in the C&#38;CB operating segment. 

Service charges on deposits include account maintenance, cash and treasury management, wire transfers, ATM, overdraft, and other deposit-related fees. The Company&#8217;s execution of the services related to these fees represents its performance obligations. Each of these performance obligations are either satisfied over time or at a point in time as the services are provided to the client. The Company is the principal when rendering these services. Payments for services provided are either withdrawn from client accounts as services are rendered or in the billing period following the completion of the service. The transaction price for each of these fees is based on the Company&#8217;s predetermined fee schedules. Service charges on deposits are recognized in the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB operating segments. 

Truist Financial Corporation 107 

Card and payment related fees include interchange fees from credit and debit cards, merchant acquirer revenue, and other card related services. Interchange fees are earned by the Company each time a request for payment is initiated by a client at a merchant for which the Company transfers the funds on behalf of the client. Interchange rates are set by the payment network and are based on purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees are received daily and recognized at a point in time when the card transaction is processed, which represents the Company&#8217;s related performance obligation. The Company is considered an agent of the client and incurs costs with the payment network to facilitate the interchange with the merchant; therefore, the related payment network expense is recognized as a reduction of card fees. Truist also offers rewards and/or rebates to its client based on card usage. The costs associated with these programs are recognized as a reduction of card fees. Card and payment related fees are recognized in the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB operating segments. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, plus common share equivalents calculated for stock options, warrants, and restricted stock outstanding using the treasury stock method, except in a net loss where diluted EPS is equal to basic. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s EPS, see &#8220;Note 20. Computation of EPS.&#8221; 

Related Party Transactions 

The Company periodically enters into transactions with certain of its executive officers, directors, affiliates, trusts, and/or other related parties in its ordinary course of business. The Company is required to disclose material related party transactions, other than certain compensation and other arrangements entered into in the normal course of business. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s related party activities, see &#8220;Note 2. Business Combinations, Divestitures, and Noncontrolling Interests,&#8221; &#8220;Note 15. Benefit Plans,&#8221; and &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies.&#8221; 

Subsequent Events 

The Company evaluated events that occurred between December 31, 2023 and the date the accompanying financial statements were issued, and there were no material events, other than those already discussed, that would require recognition in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the accompanying Notes. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s subsequent events, see &#8220;Note 2. Business Combinations, Divestitures, and Noncontrolling Interests.&#8221;

Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements 

##TABLE_START Standard / Adoption Date Description Effects on the Financial Statements Standards Adopted During the Current Year Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures January 1, 2023 Eliminates TDRs, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, requires disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. 

Truist adopted this standard on a modified-retrospective basis. Upon adoption, the Company eliminated the separate ACL estimation process for loans classified as TDRs. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements. The Company&#8217;s revised disclosures in accordance with the new standard are included in &#8220;Note 5. Loans and ACL.&#8221; 

Fair Value Hedging &#8211; Portfolio Layer Method January 1, 2023 

Introduces the portfolio layer method, which expands the current single-layer method to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio. Additionally, expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable assets, specifies eligible hedging instruments in a single-layer hedge, provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method and specifies how hedge basis adjustments should be considered when determining credit losses for the assets included in the closed portfolio. 

The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s active last-of-layer hedges. Investments in Tax Credit Structures January 1, 2023 Allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. Previously, reporting entities were only permitted to apply the proportional amortization method to qualifying equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. 

Truist adopted this standard early on a modified-retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements. Refer to &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional information regarding tax credit investments. 

Standards Not Yet Adopted Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures January 1, 2025 

Improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. 

Truist is evaluating the impact of this standard on its disclosures. This standard relates to footnote disclosures only. Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures December 31, 2024 

Improves reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

Divestitures and Noncontrolling Interest 

On April 3, 2023, the Company completed its sale of a 20 % stake of the common equity in TIH, which was previously wholly owned by Truist, to an investor group led by Stone Point Capital, LLC for $ 1.9 billion, with the proceeds, net of tax, recognized as an increase to shareholders&#8217; equity. In connection with the transaction, the noncontrolling interest holder received profits interest representing 3.75 % coverage on TIH&#8217;s fully diluted equity value at transaction close, and certain consent and exit rights commensurate with a noncontrolling investor. Including these profits interests, the noncontrolling interest holder is allocated approximately 23 % of TIH pretax net income. Also in conjunction with the same transaction, TIH granted certain event-vested profits interests and appreciation units, representing 4.50 % coverage on TIH&#8217;s fully diluted equity value at grant, to various TIH employees and officers in the second quarter of 2023. These awards, subject to continued employment through the applicable event or date, will vest either upon, or from six months to two years following, a change in control of TIH, depending on the nature of the change in control. 

On February 20, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the remaining 80 % stake of the common equity in TIH to an investor group led by Stone Point Capital LLC for a purchase price that implies an enterprise value for TIH of $ 15.5 billion, and is expected to result in cash proceeds to Truist of approximately $ 10.1 billion after-tax, reflecting certain closing adjustments for cash, debt and debt-like items, including the settlement of certain previously granted TIH awards, working capital, transaction expenses and an investor return amount associated with the originally sold 20 % stake. The transaction improves Truist&#8217;s relative capital position and allows Truist to maintain strategic flexibility. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon closing, the transaction will result in a full deconsolidation of the TIH subsidiary from Truist, and an expected gain equal to the excess of after-tax cash proceeds over Truist&#8217;s approximate $ 5.4 billion investment in its TIH subsidiary.

NOTE 3. Securities Financing Activities 

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are primarily collateralized by U.S. government or agency securities and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold, plus accrued interest. Securities borrowed are primarily collateralized by corporate securities. The Company borrows securities and purchases securities under agreements to resell as part of its securities financing activities. On the acquisition date of these securities, the Company and the related counterparty agree on the amount of collateral required to secure the principal amount loaned under these arrangements. The Company monitors collateral values daily and calls for additional collateral to be provided as warranted under the respective agreements. The following table presents securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Securities purchased under agreements to resell $ 1,168 &#160; $ 2,415 &#160; Securities borrowed 1,210 &#160; 766 &#160; Total securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell $ 2,378 &#160; $ 3,181 &#160; Fair value of collateral permitted to be resold or repledged $ 2,175 &#160; $ 3,058 &#160; Fair value of securities resold or repledged 12 &#160; 864 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Company would be obligated to provide additional collateral in the event of a significant decline in fair value of the collateral pledged. This risk is managed by monitoring the liquidity and credit quality of the collateral, as well as the maturity profile of the transactions. Refer to &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional information related to pledged securities.

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no ACL was established for AFS or HTM securities. Substantially all of the unrealized losses on the securities portfolio, including non-agency MBS, were the result of changes in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers or underlying loans. HTM debt securities consist of residential agency MBS. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to incur any credit losses on investment securities.

In the first quarter of 2023, the Company adopted the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures accounting standard. Certain newly required disclosures in this footnote are presented as of and for the period ended December 31, 2023 only as the adoption of this guidance did not impact the prior periods. As such, disclosures were provided related to TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 under prior accounting standards. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for additional information. 

The following tables present loans and leases HFI by aging category. Government guaranteed loans are not placed on nonperforming status regardless of delinquency because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. Truist sold its student loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2023, which had a carrying value of $ 4.7 billion. The year ended December 31, 2023 includes $ 98 million of charge-offs related to the sale, which was previously provided for in the allowance. ##TABLE_START Accruing December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Current 30-89 Days Past Due 90 Days Or More Past Due (1)

(2) Truist sold its student loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Charge-offs include $ 98 million related to the sale. 

The commercial ALLL increased $ 515 million and the consumer ALLL decreased $ 119 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in the commercial ALLL primarily reflects an increase in reserves related to the CRE and commercial construction portfolios. The decrease in the consumer ALLL for the year-to-date period primarily reflects the sale of the student loan portfolio in the second quarter, as well as impacts associated with the adoption of the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosure accounting standard in the first quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase related to the other consumer portfolio that was primarily driven by loan growth.

The quantitative models have been designed to estimate losses using macro-economic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years, followed by a reversion to long-term historical loss conditions over a one-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic variables used in loss forecasting include, but are not limited to, unemployment trends, U.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads, property values, home price indices, and used car prices. 

The overall economic forecast incorporates a third-party baseline forecast that is adjusted to reflect Truist&#8217;s interest rate outlook. Management also considers optimistic and pessimistic third-party macro-economic forecasts in order to capture uncertainty in the economic environment. These forecasts, along with the primary economic forecast, are weighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30% pessimistic in the December 31, 2023 ACL, unchanged since December 31, 2022. While the scenario weightings were unchanged, the forecast scenario reflected deterioration in certain economic variables (e.g., GDP) over the reasonable and supportable forecast period when compared to the prior year. The overall economic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at December 31, 2023 included GDP growth in the low-single digits and an unemployment rate near mid-single digits. 

Quantitative models have certain limitations with respect to estimating expected losses, particularly in times of rapidly changing macro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a result, management believes that the qualitative component of the ACL, which incorporates management&#8217;s expert judgment related to expected future credit losses, will continue to be an important component of the ACL for the foreseeable future. The December 31, 2023 ACL estimate includes adjustments to consider the impact of current and expected events or risks not captured by the loss forecasting models, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models.

The tables above exclude trial modifications totaling $ 47 million as of December 31, 2023. Such modifications will be included in the modification activity disclosure if the borrower successfully completes the trial period and the loan modification is finalized. 

As of December 31, 2023, Truist had $ 702 million in unfunded lending commitments related to the modified obligations summarized in the tables above. 

Upon Truist&#8217;s determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount.

NOTE 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The Company performed quantitative goodwill impairment analyses for its CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB, and IH reporting units as of October 1, 2023. Based on the results of the impairment analyses, the Company concluded that the carrying values of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units exceed their respective fair values, resulting in a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The fair value of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units were estimated using the income approach and a market-based approach, weighted 50% and 50%, respectively. The goodwill impairment was primarily due to the continued impact of higher interest rates and discount rates on the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units, and a sustained decline in the banking industry share prices, including Truist&#8217;s. The goodwill impairment has no impact on Truist&#8217;s liquidity, regulatory capital ratios, or Truist&#8217;s ability to pay its common dividend and service its clients&#8217; financial needs. The Company monitored events and circumstances during the period from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Truist specific performance indicators, a comparison of management&#8217;s forecast and assumptions to those used in its October 1, 2023 quantitative impairment test, and the sensitivity of the October 1, 2023 quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through December 31, 2023. Based on these considerations, the Company concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of December 31, 2023. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for additional information. 

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to operating segments are reflected in the table below. Activity during 2023 includes the aforementioned impairments and the realignment of Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation into the C&#38;CB segment from the IH segment.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the above table, the effect of an adverse variation in one assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the effect of the change. See &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; for additional information on the valuation techniques used.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. DTAs and DTLs are measured using the enacted federal and state tax rates in the periods in which the DTAs or DTLs are expected to be realized. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, a net deferred income tax asset is recorded in Other assets and a net deferred income tax liability is recorded in Other liabilities. Significant DTAs and DTLs, net of the federal impact for state taxes, are presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START

The DTAs include state NOLs and other state carryforwards that will expire, if not utilized, in varying amounts from 2024 to 2043. The Company had a valuation allowance recorded against certain state NOL carryforward DTAs of $ 105 million and $ 106 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The following table provides a rollforward of the Company&#8217;s gross federal and state UTBs, excluding interest and penalties: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Balance, January 1 $ 97 &#160; $ 104 &#160; Increases in UTBs related to prior years 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Decreases in UTBs related to prior years ( 12 ) ( 2 ) Increases in UTBs related to the current year 10 &#160; 9 &#160; Decreases in UTBs related to settlements ( 2 ) ( 4 ) Decreases in UTBs related to lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations ( 15 ) ( 12 ) Balance, December 31 $ 80 &#160; $ 97 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The amount of UTBs that would favorably affect the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate, if recognized, was $ 66 million and $ 80 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are recorded in the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company had a gross liability of $ 13 million and $ 11 million for interest and penalties related to its UTBs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of gross expense related to interest and penalties on UTBs was immaterial. 

The Company files U.S. federal, state, and local income tax returns. The Company&#8217;s federal income tax returns are no longer subject to assessment by the IRS for taxable years prior to 2020. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to assessment by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2018. It is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $ 34 million during the next 12 months due to completion of tax authority examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitations. It is uncertain how much, if any, of this potential decrease will impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate.

NOTE 15. Benefit Plans 

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans 

Truist provides defined benefit retirement plans qualified under the IRC. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employee&#8217;s compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment. In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the IRC. Although technically unfunded plans, Rabbi Trusts, and insurance policies on the lives of certain of the covered employees are available to finance future benefits. 

The following tables present a summary of the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the qualified pension plan net asset is recorded as a component of Other assets and the nonqualified pension plan net liability is recorded as a component of Other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31. ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) Location 2023 2022 2021 Net periodic pension cost: &#160; &#160; &#160; Service cost Personnel expense $ 341 &#160; $ 548 &#160; $ 612 &#160; Interest cost Other expense 446 &#160; 351 &#160; 319 &#160; Estimated return on plan assets Other expense ( 909 ) ( 1,078 ) ( 998 ) Net amortization and other Other expense 78 &#160; 35 &#160; 35 &#160; Net periodic benefit cost (income) ( 44 ) ( 144 ) ( 32 ) Pre-tax amounts recognized in OCI: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net actuarial loss (gain) ( 567 ) 1,949 &#160; ( 1,012 ) Net amortization ( 78 ) ( 35 ) ( 35 ) Net amount recognized in OCI ( 645 ) 1,914 &#160; ( 1,047 ) Total net periodic pension costs (income) recognized in total comprehensive income, pre-tax

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Truist considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data for each asset category, as well as historical actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long-term rate of return for the plan based on target asset allocations contained in the Company&#8217;s Investment Policy Statement. For 2024, the expected rate of return on plan assets is 6.8 %. 

Activity in the projected benefit obligation is presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) Qualified Plan Nonqualified Plans 2023 2022 2023 2022 Projected benefit obligation, January 1 $ 7,924 &#160; $ 10,461 &#160; $ 655 &#160; $ 740 &#160; Service cost 308 &#160; 503 &#160; 33 &#160; 45 &#160; Interest cost 411 &#160; 327 &#160; 35 &#160; 25 &#160; Actuarial (gain) loss (1)

(1) For the qualified plan, the 2023 loss is primarily due to decreases in the assumed discount rate, net of the impact of actual plan experience. For the nonqualified plans, the 2023 gain is primarily due to impact of plan experience. For the qualified plan, the 2022 gains are primarily due to increases in the assumed discount rate, net of the impact of actual plan experience. For the nonqualified plans, the 2022 gain is primarily due to an increase in the assumed discount rate. 

(2) In 2023, the Company entered into a transaction to sell a portion of the pension obligations to a third party for certain participants in the qualified defined benefit plan.

Truist has historically made contributions to the qualified pension plan in amounts between the minimum required for funding and the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. Truist does not currently expect contributions for 2024. For the nonqualified plans, employer contributions are based on benefit payments. 

The following table reflects the estimated benefit payments for the periods presented: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Qualified Plan Nonqualified Plans 2024 $ 342 &#160; $ 31 &#160; 2025 348 &#160; 37 &#160; 2026 364 &#160; 34 &#160; 2027 383 &#160; 35 &#160; 2028 402 &#160; 36 &#160; 2029-2033 2,321 &#160; 203 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The Company&#8217;s primary total return objective is to achieve returns that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies the fiduciary requirements of ERISA. The plan assets have a long-term time horizon that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon that extends well beyond a full market cycle and can assume an above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard deviation of annual return. The investments are broadly diversified among economic sector, industry, quality, and size in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Within approved guidelines and restrictions, investment managers have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments. 

Truist periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment policy and makes changes to its target asset allocation. Truist has established guidelines within each asset category to ensure the appropriate balance of risk and reward. The following table presents the fair values of the qualified pension plan assets by asset category: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Target Allocation December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Min Max Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2

Defined Contribution Plans 

Truist offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution plans that permit teammates to contribute up to 50 % of cash compensation. For full-time teammates who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, Truist made matching contributions of up to 6 % of the employee&#8217;s compensation through December 31, 2023. Beginning on January 1, 2024, Truist will make a match up to 4 % of the employee&#8217;s compensation and may provide an additional discretionary matching contribution. The Company&#8217;s contribution expense for the 401(k) Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $ 264 million, $ 257 million and $ 272 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain teammates of subsidiaries participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan with different matching formulas. 

Equity-Based Compensation Plans 

At December 31, 2023, RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs were outstanding from equity-based compensation plans that have been approved by shareholders and plans assumed from acquired entities. Those plans are intended to assist the Company in recruiting and retaining teammates, directors, and independent contractors and to align the interests of eligible participants with those of Truist and its shareholders. 

The majority of outstanding awards and awards available to be issued relate to plans that allow for accelerated vesting of awards for holders who retire and have met all retirement eligibility requirements or in connection with certain other events. Until vested, certain of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the common stock price on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends that will be foregone during the vesting period. Substantially all awards are granted in February of each year. Grants to non-executive teammates primarily consist of RSUs.

Truist Financial Corporation 133 

NOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies 

Truist utilizes a variety of financial instruments to mitigate exposure to risks and meet the financing needs and provide investment opportunities for clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees, derivatives, and other investments. Truist also has commitments to fund certain affordable housing investments and contingent liabilities related to certain sold loans. 

Tax Credit and Certain Equity Investments 

The Company invests in certain affordable housing projects throughout its market area as a means of supporting local communities. Truist receives tax credits related to these investments, for which the Company typically acts as a limited partner and therefore does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. Truist typically provides financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. Tax credits are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level. Truist&#8217;s maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity, exclusive of any potential tax recapture associated with the investments. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as the Company&#8217;s other loans and are generally secured. 

The Company invests as a limited partner in certain projects through the New Market Tax Credit program, which is a Federal financial program aimed to stimulate business and real estate investment in underserved communities via a Federal tax credit. Following the first quarter of 2023 adoption of the Investments in Tax Credit Structures accounting standard, these tax credits, referred to as &#8220;Other qualified tax credits&#8221; below, qualify for the proportional amortization method. The Company also applied the proportional amortization method to investments through the Production Tax Credits program. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for additional information. 

The Company also invests in entities that promote renewable energy sources as a limited partner. The Company has determined that these renewable energy tax credit partnerships are VIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs&#8217; financial performance and therefore, it is not required to consolidate these VIEs. The Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss related to these investments is limited to its equity investments in these partnerships and any additional unfunded equity commitments. 

Truist has investments in and future funding commitments related to private equity and certain other equity method investments. The risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and future funding commitments made.

(1) In the first quarter of 2023, the Company adopted the Investments in Tax Credit Structures accounting standard. As a result, amortization related to these tax credits started being recognized in the Provision for income taxes as of the adoption of this standard. This activity was previously recognized in Other income. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for additional information. 

Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees 

In the normal course of business, Truist utilizes certain financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to risks. Such financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial guarantee arrangements. 

Commitments to extend, originate, or purchase credit are primarily lines of credit to businesses and consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse change clauses, which allow Truist to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers&#8217; creditworthiness. The fair values of commitments are estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated based on the counterparties&#8217; creditworthiness and average default rates for loan products with similar risks. Consumer lending and revolving credit commitments have an immaterial fair value as Truist typically has the unconditional ability to cancel such commitments. Refer to &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; for additional disclosures on the RUFC. 

Truist has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain recourse provisions. These provisions generally require Truist to reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred after the disposal of the property. Truist also issues standard representations and warranties related to mortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to &#8220;Note 8. Loan Servicing&#8221; for additional disclosures related to these exposures. 

Letters of credit and financial guarantees are unconditional commitments issued by Truist to guarantee the performance of a client to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and, as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. 

The following is a summary of selected notional amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Commitments to extend, originate, or purchase credit and other commitments $ 207,285 &#160; $ 216,838 &#160; Residential mortgage loans sold with recourse 173 &#160; 200 &#160; CRE mortgages serviced for others covered by recourse provisions 9,661 &#160; 9,955 &#160; Other loans serviced for others covered by recourse and other provisions 1,032 &#160; 723 &#160; Letters of credit 6,239 &#160; 6,030 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Derivatives 

Truist enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index, or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates. For additional information on derivative instruments, see &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.&#8221;

Total Return Swaps 

The Company facilitates matched book TRS transactions on behalf of clients, whereby a VIE purchases reference assets identified by a client and the Company enters into a TRS with the VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the client. The Company provides senior financing to the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund the purchase of the reference assets. Reference assets are typically fixed income instruments primarily composed of syndicated bank loans. The TRS contracts pass through interest and other cash flows on the reference assets to the third-party clients, along with exposing those clients to decreases in value on the assets and providing them with the rights to appreciation on the assets. The terms of the TRS contracts require the third parties to post initial margin collateral, as well as ongoing margin as the fair values of the underlying reference assets change. The following table provides a summary of the TRS transactions with VIE purchases. VIE assets include trading loans and bonds: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Total return swaps: VIE assets $ 1,641 &#160; $ 1,830 &#160; Trading loans and bonds 1,572 &#160; 1,790 &#160; VIE liabilities 50 &#160; 163 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

The Company concluded that the associated VIEs should be consolidated because the Company has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits, which could potentially be significant. The activities of the VIEs are restricted to buying and selling the reference assets, and the risks/benefits of any such assets owned by the VIEs are passed to the third-party clients via the TRS contracts. For additional information on TRS contracts and the related VIEs, see &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.&#8221; 

Other Commitments 

Truist holds public funds in certain states that do not require 100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting uncollateralized deposit shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon the public deposits held by each bank within the respective state) by the remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that state. Truist monitors deposit levels relative to the total public deposits held by all depository institutions within these states. The likelihood that the Company would have to perform under this guarantee is dependent on whether any financial institutions holding public funds default, as well as the adequacy of collateral coverage. 

In the ordinary course of business, Truist indemnifies its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from pending litigation. Truist also issues standard representations and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnification arrangements provide similar indemnifications to Truist. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, Truist does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of Truist. 

As a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock. The board of directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase Truist&#8217;s investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future investments in the FHLB stock are not determinable. 

The Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation for trade comparisons, netting, and settlement of fixed income securities. As a Government Securities Division netting member, the Company has a commitment to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation to meet its financial obligations as a central counterparty clearing house in the event the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation has insufficient liquidity resources through a potential committed liquidity resource repurchase transaction. Any commitment would be based on the Company&#8217;s share of its liquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Truist does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of Truist.

Pledged Assets 

Certain assets were pledged to secure municipal deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, certain derivative agreements, and borrowings or borrowing capacity, as well as to fund certain obligations related to nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable asset discounts when determining borrowing capacity. The Company has capacity for secured financing from both the FRB and FHLB and letters of credit from the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s letters of credit from the FHLB can be used to secure various client deposits, including public fund relationships. Excluding assets related to nonqualified benefit plans, the majority of the agreements governing the pledged assets do not permit the other party to sell or repledge the collateral. The following table provides the total carrying amount of pledged assets by asset type: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Pledged securities $ 41,270 &#160; $ 38,012 &#160; Pledged loans: FRB 73,898 &#160; 71,234 &#160; FHLB 67,748 &#160; 68,988 &#160; Unused borrowing capacity: FRB 55,252 &#160; 49,250 &#160; FHLB 24,712 &#160; 20,770 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

Legal Proceedings and Other Matters 

Truist and its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in or parties to numerous actual or threatened legal proceedings and other matters and are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with them. The legal proceedings and other matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Claims may be based in law or equity&#8212;such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, antitrust, tax, employment, and other laws&#8212;and some present novel legal theories, allegations of substantial or indeterminate damages, demands for injunctive or similar relief, and requests for fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in Truist&#8217;s business practices. Our legal proceedings and other matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. 

The course and outcome of legal proceedings and other matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when actual or threatened legal proceedings and other matters will be resolved and what losses may be incrementally and ultimately incurred. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, including those described below, if unfavorable, may be material to the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause significant reputational consequences. 

Truist establishes accruals for legal proceedings and other matters when potential losses become probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are evaluated each quarter and may be adjusted, upward or downward, based on our best judgment after consultation with counsel and others. No assurance exists that our accruals will not need to be adjusted in the future. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued, possibly to a significant degree. 

The Company estimates reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to approximately $ 350 million as of December 31, 2023. This estimate does not represent Truist&#8217;s maximum loss exposure, and actual losses may vary significantly. Also, the outcome of a particular matter may be one that the Company did not take into account in its estimate because the Company judged the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. In addition, the matters underlying this estimate may change from time to time. Estimated losses, like accruals, are based upon currently available information and involve considerable uncertainties and judgment. 

For certain matters, Truist may be unable to estimate the loss or range of loss, even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible, until developments in the matter provide additional information sufficient to support such an estimate. These matters are not accrued for and are not reflected in the estimate of reasonably possible losses.

The following is a description of certain legal proceedings and other matters in which Truist is involved: 

Bickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank 

This class action case was filed in the Fulton County State Court on July 12, 2010, and an amended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010. Plaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees charged to his account which related to debit card and ATM transactions are actually interest charges and therefore subject to the usury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint asserts claims for violations of civil and criminal usury laws, conversion, and money had and received, and seeks damages on a class-wide basis, including refunds of challenged overdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On October 6, 2017, the trial court granted plaintiff&#8217;s motion for class certification and defined the class as &#8220;Every Georgia citizen who had or has one or more accounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or debit card transaction (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a refund of those Fees,&#8221; and the granting of a certified class was affirmed on appeal. On behalf of the certified class as currently defined, Plaintiff seeks a return of up to $ 452 million in paid overdraft fees from the 2006 to 2017 period above, plus prejudgment interest which, based on the amount of claimed fees, was estimated to be approximately $ 400 million as of December 31, 2023. On October 31, 2023, Truist filed motions to amend the class definition to narrow the scope of the class, to compel arbitration against certain class members, and for summary judgment, which were heard by the court on February 14, 2024, and are pending. A court-ordered mediation is scheduled for February 28, 2024, and trial is presently set to commence on April 29, 2024. The Company continues to believe that it has substantial defenses against the underlying claims. 

Recordkeeping Matters 

The SEC and CFTC have requested information from various subsidiaries of the Company that conduct broker-dealer, investment adviser, and swap dealer activities regarding compliance with applicable recordkeeping requirements for business-related electronic communications. The Company has cooperated with these requests and is in advanced discussions regarding resolutions of these matters with the agencies though there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. The SEC and CFTC have been conducting similar investigations of other financial institutions regarding business-related communications sent over unapproved electronic messaging channels and have entered into a number of resolutions with various institutions to date. 

Investigation Regarding Trusts 

In 2016 and 2018, the Civil Division of the U.S. DOJ issued subpoenas to a corporate predecessor of Truist Bank under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act. These subpoenas requested documents and other information related to specified trusts for which Truist Bank serves as trustee. U.S. DOJ has recently requested additional information, and Truist Bank is continuing to cooperate in the investigation. 

FDIC Special Assessment 

In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. The assessment is based on an insured depository institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022. The special assessment for Truist is $ 507 million, which was recognized in Q4 2023 and will be paid in eight quarterly installments beginning in 2024. The ultimate amount of expenses associated with the special assessment will also be impacted by the finalization of the losses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which could result in additional expense.

NOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions 

Truist Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action regulations. 

Truist is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Truist&#8217;s capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Truist is in full compliance with these requirements. Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for IDIs: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Truist and Truist Bank were classified as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; and management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to year end that would change this designation. 

Quantitative measures are established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Truist to maintain minimum capital ratios. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. The following table provides additional detail on regulatory capital ratios: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Minimum Capital (1)

(1) Truist is subject to an SCB requirement of 2.9 % applicable to Truist as of December 31, 2023. Truist&#8217;s SCB requirement, received in the 2023 CCAR process, is effective from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Truist Bank is subject to a CCB requirement of 2.5 %. The SCB and CCB are amounts above the minimum levels designed to ensure that banks remain well-capitalized, even in adverse economic scenarios. 

As an approved seller/servicer, Truist Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of capital, as specified by various agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC, and FNMA. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Truist Bank&#8217;s capital was above all required levels.

NOTE 18. Fair Value Disclosures 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three-level measurement hierarchy: 

&#8226; Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 

&#8226; Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets 

&#8226; Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable

(1) Refer to &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; for additional discussion on netting adjustments. 

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, investments totaling $ 459 million and $ 385 million, respectively, have been excluded from the table above as they are valued based on net asset value as a practical expedient. These investments primarily consist of certain SBIC funds. 

The following discussion focuses on the valuation techniques and significant inputs for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Available for Sale and Trading Securities: Securities accounted for at fair value include both the available-for-sale and trading portfolios. The Company uses prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes, or recent trades to estimate the fair value of securities. The majority of AFS securities were priced by third-party vendors whereas trading securities are priced internally. The AFS securities and trading securities are subject to IPV. Management independently evaluates the fair values of AFS Securities and trading securities through comparisons to external pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on any security sales to the pricing information received from the pricing service. Fair value measurements for trading securities are derived from observable market-based information including, but not limited to, overall market conditions, recent trades, comparable securities, broker quotes and FINRA&#8217;s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine data when determining the value of a position. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon the sale of a security. As described by security type below, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. 

Trading loans: The Company has elected to measure trading loans at fair value. Trading loans are valued primarily using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third-party pricing service. Trading loans include: 

&#8226; loans held in connection with the Company&#8217;s trading business primarily consisting of commercial and corporate leveraged loans; 

&#8226; loans made or acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business; and 

&#8226; SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government for December 31, 2022 only. 

Truist Financial Corporation 141 

U.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities are valued using quoted prices in active over-the-counter markets. 

GSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities consist of debt obligations issued by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FHLB, and other agencies, as well as securities collateralized by loans that are guaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Agency MBS includes pass-through securities and CMOs issued by GSEs and U.S. government agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by the issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including benchmark TBA security pricing and yield curves that were estimated based on U.S. Treasury yields and certain floating rate indices. The pricing matrices for these securities may also give consideration to pool-specific data supplied directly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using market-based pricing matrices that are based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above. 

States and political subdivisions: The Company&#8217;s investments in U.S. states and political subdivisions include obligations of county and municipal authorities and agency bonds, which are general obligations of the municipality or are supported by a specified revenue source. Holdings are geographically dispersed, with no significant concentrations in any one state or municipality. Additionally, all municipal obligations are highly rated or are otherwise collateralized by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. These securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer spreads, material event notices and benchmark yield curves. 

Non-agency MBS: Non-agency MBS included purchased interests in third-party securitizations that have a high investment grade rating, and the pricing matrices for these securities were based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above. 

Corporate and other debt securities: These securities consist primarily of corporate bonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds are senior and subordinated debt obligations of domestic corporations. The Company acquires commercial paper that is generally short-term in nature and highly rated. These securities are valued based on a review of quoted market prices for similar assets as well as through the various other inputs discussed previously. 

LHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are originated to be sold to investors are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted for servicing, interest rate risk, and credit risk. The changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage LHFS. 

Loans and leases: Fair values for loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss expectations, market interest rates, and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. The probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions are informed by inter nal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate was determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. 

Loan servicing rights: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios and then are discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and other observable market data. Commercial MSRs and other loan servicing rights are valued using a cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows. The Company considers actual and expected loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors that are determined based on current market conditions. Refer to &#8220;Note 8. Loan Servicing&#8221; for additional information on valuation techniques and inputs for loan servicing rights. 

Derivative assets and liabilities: The Company holds derivative instruments for both trading and risk management purposes. These include exchange-traded futures or option contracts, OTC swaps, options, forwards, and interest rate lock commitments. The fair values of derivatives are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable assumptions for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair values of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as Level 3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that are not expected to fund and include the value attributable to the net servicing fees. Funding rates are based on the Company&#8217;s historical data. The fair value attributable to servicing is based on discounted cash flows, and is impacted by prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually specified servicing fees, servicing costs, and underlying portfolio characteristics.

Equity securities: Equity securities primarily consist of exchange-traded securities and are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 

Private equity investments: In many cases there are no observable market values for these investments, and therefore, management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating performance of the investee to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant judgment, and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated. 

Securities sold short: Securities sold short represent debt securities sold short that are entered into as a hedging strategy for the purposes of supporting institutional and retail client trading activities. The fair value of securities sold short is determined in the same manner as trading securities. 

Activity for Level 3 assets and liabilities is summarized below: ##TABLE_START &#160; (Dollars in millions) Loans and Leases Loan Servicing Rights Net Derivatives Balance at January 1, 2021 $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2,023 &#160; $ 172 &#160; Total realized and unrealized gains (losses): Included in earnings ( 1 ) 233 &#160; ( 96 ) Purchases &#8212; &#160; 355 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Issuances &#8212; &#160; 715 &#160; 305 &#160; Sales &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 741 ) ( 393 ) Acquisitions 24 &#160; 49 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Balance at December 31, 2021 23 &#160; 2,633 &#160; ( 12 ) Total realized and unrealized gains (losses): &#160; Included in earnings &#8212; &#160; 801 &#160; ( 323 ) Purchases &#8212; &#160; 321 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Issuances &#8212; &#160; 482 &#160; 2 &#160; Sales &#8212; &#160; ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; Settlements ( 5 ) ( 470 ) 297 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 18 &#160; 3,758 &#160; ( 36 ) Total realized and unrealized gains (losses): Included in earnings &#8212; &#160; 86 &#160; ( 36 ) Purchases &#8212; &#160; 123 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Issuances &#8212; &#160; 270 &#160; 29 &#160; Sales &#8212; &#160; ( 531 ) &#8212; &#160; Settlements ( 3 ) ( 328 ) 24 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2023 $ 15 &#160; $ 3,378 &#160; $ ( 19 ) Change in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings for the period, attributable to assets and liabilities still held at December 31, 2023 $ &#8212; &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ ( 24 ) Primary income statement location of realized gains (losses) included in earnings

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

The following table provides information about certain assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis still held as of period end. The carrying values represent end of period values, which approximate the fair value measurements that occurred on the various measurement dates throughout the period. These assets are considered to be Level 3 assets. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Carrying value: LHFS $ 19 &#160; $ 271 &#160; Loans and leases 840 &#160; 500 &#160; Other 454 &#160; 120 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The following table provides information about valuation adjustments for certain assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The valuation adjustments represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Valuation adjustments: LHFS $ ( 58 ) $ ( 9 ) $ ( 27 ) Loans and leases ( 894 ) ( 420 ) ( 455 ) Other ( 305 ) ( 159 ) ( 178 ) ##TABLE_END

LHFS with valuation adjustments in the table above consisted primarily of residential mortgages and commercial loans that were valued using market prices and measured at LOCOM. The table above excludes $ 409 million and $ 108 million of LHFS carried at cost at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, that did not require a valuation adjustment during the period. Additionally, the table above excludes $ 98 million of charge-offs related to the student loan portfolio sale that occurred in the second quarter of 2023, which was previously provided for. The remainder of LHFS is carried at fair value. 

Loans and leases consist of larger commercial loans and leases that are collateral-dependent and other secured loans and leases that have been charged-off to the fair value of the collateral. Valuation adjustments for loans and leases are primarily recorded in the Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for additional discussion of individually evaluated loans and leases. 

Other includes foreclosed real estate, other foreclosed property, ROU assets, premises and equipment, OREO, and held for sale operating leases, and consists primarily of residential homes, commercial properties, vacant lots, and automobiles. ROU assets are measured based on the fair value of the assets, which considers the potential for sublease income. The remaining assets are measured at LOCOM, less costs to sell. 

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 

For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, estimates of fair value are based on relevant market data and information about the instruments. Values obtained relate to trading without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership, possible tax ramifications, estimated transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various instruments. 

An active market does not exist for certain financial instruments. Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions and interest rate risk characteristics, loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates. Financial assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value are summarized below: ##TABLE_START December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value Hierarchy Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Financial assets: HTM securities Level 2 $ 54,107 &#160; $ 44,630 &#160; $ 57,713 &#160; $ 47,791 &#160; Loans and leases HFI, net of ALLL Level 3 307,248 &#160; 300,830 &#160; 321,596 &#160; 308,738 &#160; Financial liabilities: &#160; &#160; Time deposits Level 2 43,561 &#160; 43,368 &#160; 23,474 &#160; 23,383 &#160; Long-term debt Level 2 38,918 &#160; 38,353 &#160; 43,203 &#160; 40,951 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Credit Derivative Instruments 

As part of the Company&#8217;s corporate and investment banking business, the Company enters into contracts that are, in form or substance, written guarantees; specifically, risk participations, TRS, and credit default swaps. The Company accounts for these contracts as derivatives. 

Truist has entered into risk participation agreements to share the credit exposure with other financial institutions on client-related interest rate derivative contracts. Under these agreements, the Company has guaranteed payment to a dealer counterparty in the event the counterparty experiences a loss on the derivative due to a failure to pay by the counterparty&#8217;s client. The Company manages its payment risk on its risk participations by monitoring the creditworthiness of the underlying client through the normal credit review process that the Company would have performed had it entered into a derivative directly with the obligors. At December 31, 2023, the remaining terms on these risk participations ranged from less than one year to 14 years. The potential future exposure represents the Company&#8217;s maximum estimated exposure to written risk participations, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments based on scenario simulations and assuming 100% default by all obligors on the maximum value. 

The Company has also entered into TRS contracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its credit risk, the Company typically receives initial margin from the counterparty upon entering into the TRS and variation margin if the fair value of the underlying reference assets deteriorates. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s TRS contracts, see &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies.&#8221; 

The Company enters into credit default swaps to hedge credit risk associated with certain loans and leases. The Company accounts for these contracts as derivatives, and accordingly, recognizes these contracts at fair value.

(1) For the year ended December 31, 2023, outstanding equity-based awards were deemed anti-dilutive and therefore, excluded from the Company&#8217;s diluted EPS calculation. 

NOTE 21. Operating Segments 

In 2023, Truist operated and measured business activity across three segments: CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB, and IH, with functional activities included in OT&#38;C. These segments have been realigned for 2024 as described below. The Company&#8217;s business segment structure is based on the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management as well as the products and services provided or the type of client served. 

In conjunction with the Company&#8217;s April 3, 2023 sale of a 20 % stake of the common equity in TIH, TIH issued $ 5.0 billion of 8.25 % mandatorily redeemable preferred units to the Company, with the related interest expense, which is fully allocable to the Company, reported in Net intersegment interest income (expense). TIH is the principal legal entity of the IH segment. 

Also related to the same transaction, TIH recapitalized from a corporate entity to an LLC, such that each partner is allocated its share of TIH&#8217;s income before taxes, and beginning in the second quarter of 2023 the Company recognizes its associated income tax provision through OT&#38;C. The Company elected not to restate prior periods for this change based on TIH&#8217;s previous status as a corporate entity. The Company recognized $ 110 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 of tax provision related to IH in OT&#38;C. IH continues to recognize taxes for certain state jurisdictions that impose income taxes on partnerships and LLCs. 

Consumer Banking and Wealth 

The CB&#38;W segment is made up of two primary businesses: 

&#8226; Consumer &#38; Small Business Banking provides banking, borrowing, investing, insurance solutions, and advice through Retail Banking, Premier Banking, and Small Business Banking to individuals and small business clients through an extensive network of branches and ATMs, digital channels, and contact centers. Financial products and services offered include deposits and payments, credit cards, loans, mortgages, brokerage and investment advisory services and insurance solutions. Consumer and Small Business Banking also serves as an entry point for clients and services for other businesses. It includes Indirect Lending Services, providing a comprehensive set of technology-enabled consumer lending solutions including point-of-sale offerings through Sheffield, Service Finance, Recreational Lending, and Dealer Retail Services. It also includes Mortgage Banking, which offers residential mortgage products nationally through its retail and correspondent channels, digital and by telephone. These products are either sold in the secondary market, typically with servicing rights retained, or held in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Mortgage Banking services loans held in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as well as those held by third-party investors. Mortgage also includes Mortgage Warehouse Lending, which provides short-term lending solutions to finance first-lien residential mortgage LHFS by independent mortgage companies. 

&#8226; Wealth provides a full array of wealth management and banking products and professional services to individuals and institutional clients, including trust, brokerage, professional investment advisory, business transition advice, loans and deposits services to clients seeking active management of their financial resources. Institutional clients are served by the Institutional Investment Management Group. Full service and online/discount brokerage products are offered to individual clients; additionally, investment advisory products and services are offered to clients through an SEC registered investment advisor. Wealth also provides family office services, Truist Center for Family Legacy, to clients and their families to help them manage and sustain wealth across multiple generations, including family meeting facilitation, consolidated reporting, expense management, and specialty asset management, as well as other wealth management disciplines. 

150 Truist Financial Corporation 

Corporate and Commercial Banking 

The C&#38;CB segment is made up of five primary businesses: 

&#8226; Corporate and Investment Banking delivers a comprehensive range of strategic advisory, capital raising, risk management, financing, liquidity and investment solutions, with the goal of serving the needs of both public and private companies in the C&#38;CB segment. Investment Banking and Corporate Banking teams within CIB serve clients across the nation, offering a full suite of traditional banking and investment banking products and services. Clients across diversified industry sectors including consumer and healthcare, energy, technology, financial services, industrials, and media and communications are provided a unique, high touch advisory approach by industry experts on the CIB team based on client size, complexity, and frequency of capital markets issuance. 

&#8226; Commercial Community Banking offers an array of traditional banking products, including lending, deposits, cash management and investment banking solutions via CIB to commercial clients, including not-for-profit organizations, governmental entities, healthcare and aging services and auto dealer financing (floor plan inventory financing). Local teams deliver these solutions along with the Company&#8217;s industry expertise to commercial clients to help them achieve their goals. 

&#8226; Commercial Real Estate provides a range of credit and deposit services as well as fee-based product offerings to developers, operators, and investors in commercial real estate properties through its National Banking Division. Additionally, Commercial Real Estate offers tailored financing and equity investment solutions for community development and affordable housing projects, with particular expertise in Low Income Housing Tax Credits and New Market Tax Credits. Real Estate Corporate and Investment Banking delivers banking, capital markets, and strategic advisory solutions to REIT, fund, and public home-builder clients. It also includes Grandbridge Real Estate Capital LLC, a fully integrated commercial mortgage investment banking company that originates commercial and multi-family real estate loans, services loan portfolios, and provides asset and portfolio management. 

&#8226; Wholesale Payments provides treasury, merchant services, and commercial card solutions to Truist&#8217;s business clients, ranging from small businesses to large corporate institutions. 

&#8226; Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation, AFCO Credit Corporation, and CAFO Holding Company are insurance premium finance subsidiaries that provide funding to businesses in the U.S. and Canada for the purchase of commercial insurance policies. 

Insurance Holdings 

Truist&#8217;s IH segment is one of the largest insurance agency / brokerage networks, providing property and casualty, employee benefits and life insurance to businesses and individuals. It also provides small business and corporate services, such as workers compensation and professional liability, as well as surety coverage and title insurance. 

Other, Treasury &#38; Corporate 

OT&#38;C includes management of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio, long-term debt, derivative instruments used for balance sheet hedging, short-term liquidity and funding activities, balance sheet risk management and most real estate assets, as well as the Company&#8217;s functional activities such as finance, enterprise risk, legal, enterprise technology and management, among others. Additionally, OT&#38;C houses intercompany eliminations, including intersegment net referral fees and residual interest rate risk after segment allocations have taken place. 

Truist emphasizes revenue growth through the Company&#8217;s Integrated Relationship Management approach, which is designed to deepen client relationships and bring the full breadth and depth of Truist&#8217;s products and services to meet clients&#8217; financial needs. The objective is to provide Truist&#8217;s entire suite of products to its clients with the end goal of providing clients the best financial experience in the marketplace. To promote revenue growth, revenues of certain products and services are reflected in the results of the segment providing those products and services and are also allocated to CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB. These allocated revenues between segments are reflected as net referral fees in noninterest income and eliminated in OT&#38;C. 

The segment results are presented based on internal management methodologies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The performance of the segments is not comparable with Truist&#8217;s consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships between the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 

Because business segment results are presented based on management accounting practices, the transition to the consolidated results prepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain differences, which are reflected as residuals in OT&#38;C. Business segment reporting conventions include, but are not limited to, the items as detailed below. 

Segment net interest income reflects matched maturity funds transfer pricing, which ascribes credits or charges based on the economic value or cost created by assets and liabilities of each segment. Residual differences between these credits and charges are captured in OT&#38;C. 

Truist Financial Corporation 151 

Noninterest income includes inter-segment referral fees, as well as federal and state tax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax equivalent basis, related primarily to certain community development investments. Recoveries for these allocations are reported in OT&#38;C. 

Corporate expense allocations, including overhead or functional expenses that are not directly charged to the segments, are allocated to segments based on various drivers (number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan balances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for these allocations are reported in OT&#38;C. 

Provision for credit losses represents net charge-offs by segment combined with an allocation to the segments for the provision attributable to each segment&#8217;s quarterly change in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes is calculated using a blended income tax rate for each segment and includes reversals of the noninterest income tax adjustments described above. The difference between the calculated provision for income taxes at the segment level and the consolidated provision for income taxes is reported in OT&#38;C. 

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is an active process and undergoes periodic enhancements. The implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the results disclosed for each segment, with no impact on consolidated results. When significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is revised. 

Segment Realignment 

Effective January 2024, several business activities were realigned within the segments. First, the CB&#38;W segment was renamed Consumer and Small Business Banking and the C&#38;CB segment was renamed Wholesale Banking. Second, the Wealth business was repositioned into a component of the Wholesale Banking segment from the CB&#38;W segment. Third, certain small business banking functions were repositioned into a component of the Consumer and Small Business Banking segment from the C&#38;CB segment. The following table presents segment results prior to the realignment.

The transfer of funds in the form of dividends, loans, or advances from bank subsidiaries to the Parent Company is restricted. Federal law requires loans to the Parent Company or its affiliates to be secured and at market terms and generally limits loans to the Parent Company or an individual affiliate to 10% of Truist Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. In the aggregate, loans to the Parent Company and all affiliates cannot exceed 20% of the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. 

Dividend payments to the Parent Company by Truist Bank are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends are restricted by regulatory minimum capital constraints.
