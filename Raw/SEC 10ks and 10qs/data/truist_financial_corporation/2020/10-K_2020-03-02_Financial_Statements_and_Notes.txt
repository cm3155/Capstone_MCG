 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Truist Financial Corporation 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Truist Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded SunTrust Banks, Inc. (SunTrust) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 because SunTrust was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2019. We have also excluded SunTrust from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. SunTrust&#8217;s total assets and total revenues represent approximately 40% and 5%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation of Certain Acquired Loans 

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2019 the Company acquired SunTrust for consideration of $33.5 billion. In conjunction with this acquisition, acquired loans and leases were recorded at fair value of $154.0 billion. To determine the fair value of acquired loans, management used a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors such as loan characteristics, discount rates, probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment assumptions. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain acquired loans is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management to determine the fair value of acquired loans, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to discount rates, probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment assumptions, (ii) significant audit effort was necessary to evaluate the evidence obtained relating to these assumptions, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of certain acquired loans, including controls over the discount rates, probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology. These procedures also included, among others, (i) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing independent ranges of fair value for certain acquired loans, including the development of independent assumptions for discount rates, probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment assumptions, (ii) comparison of management&#8217;s estimate to the independently developed ranges, and (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying loan data provided by management that was used to develop these assumptions. 

Valuation of Acquired Core Deposit Intangible Assets 

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of SunTrust, core deposit intangible (CDI) and other intangible assets were recorded at fair value of $2.5 billion. To estimate the fair value of acquired CDI assets, management used a discounted cash flow methodology that considered client attrition rates, discount rate, cost of the deposit base, reserve requirements, net maintenance cost, and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of acquired CDI assets is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management to determine the fair value of acquired CDI assets, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to client attrition rates, (ii) significant audit effort was necessary to evaluate the evidence obtained relating to client attrition rates used in the valuation of CDI assets, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of CDI assets, including controls over the significant assumptions used in the CDI discounted cash flow methodology. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for estimating the fair value of CDI assets, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the deposits data used in the valuation of acquired CDI assets. Procedures to test management&#8217;s process included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the client attrition rates used in the CDI discounted cash flows methodology. Evaluating the reasonableness of the client attrition rates included comparison to historical performance. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses &#8211; Collectively Evaluated Component 

As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) represents management&#8217;s estimate of probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date. The collectively evaluated component of the ALLL was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The collectively evaluated component of the ALLL includes the development of a series of loss estimate factors, which are modeled projections of the frequency and severity of losses based on analyzing historical loan and lease losses as well as historical loan and lease migration to charge-off experience. The collectively evaluated component of the ALLL also includes estimates of the impact of current economic events, overall interest rates, political conditions, and the composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the collectively evaluated component of the ALLL is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management to determine the frequency and severity of losses, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the loss estimate factors, (ii) significant effort was necessary in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the loss estimate factors, specifically the frequency and severity of losses, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s determination of the ALLL, including controls over the development of the loss estimate factors. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management&#8217;s process for determining the ALLL, including the collectively evaluated component, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the model used in determining the assumptions for the frequency and severity of losses, and (iii) testing the reliability of historical loss data.

86 Truist Financial Corporation 

NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation 

Truist Financial Corporation is a purpose-driven financial services company committed to inspire and build better lives and communities. The Company serves approximately 10 million households with leading market share in many high-growth markets in the country and offers a wide range of services including retail, small business and commercial banking; asset management; capital markets; commercial real estate; corporate and institutional banking; insurance; mortgage; payments; and wealth management. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist is the sixth-largest commercial bank in the U.S. The Company operates and measures business activity across three business segments: Consumer Banking and Wealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Insurance Holdings. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s business segments, see "Note 21. Operating Segments.&#8221; 

General 

See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this Report for terms used herein. The accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Truist Financial Corporation and those subsidiaries that are wholly or majority owned by Truist or over which Truist exercises control. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of companies or assets acquired are included from the date of acquisition. Results of operations associated with entities or net assets sold are included through the date of disposition. 

Truist holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are legal entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to independently finance its activities, or as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 

Investments in VIEs are evaluated to determine if Truist is the primary beneficiary. This evaluation gives appropriate consideration to the design of the entity and the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along, the relative power of each party, and to Truist's relative obligation to absorb losses or receive residual returns of the entity. Truist has variable interests in certain entities that are not required to be consolidated, including affordable housing and other partnership interests. Refer to "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional disclosures regarding Truist's VIEs. 

Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financing decisions are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, adjusted to reflect the Company&#8217;s portion of income, loss, or dividends of the investee. Truist records its portion of income or loss in Other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These investments are periodically evaluated for impairment. 

The Company reports any noncontrolling interests in its subsidiaries in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and separately presents the income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of a consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Reclassifications 

In connection with the Merger, captions in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Noninterest income and Noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, loan categories and business activities within the segments were realigned. Amounts reported in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Truist Financial Corporation 87 

Business Combinations 

Truist accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. See "Note 2. Business Combinations" for further discussion of the Merger and its impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks that have original maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. Restricted cash was immaterial at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

Securities Financing Activities 

The Company borrows securities and purchases securities under agreements to resell as part of its securities financing activities. On the acquisition date of these securities, the Company and related counterparty agree on the amount of collateral required to secure the principal amount loaned under these agreements. The Company monitors collateral values daily and calls for additional collateral to be provided as warranted under the respective agreements. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold, plus accrued interest within Short-term borrowings. 

Trading Activities 

Various trading assets and liabilities are used to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of the Company's clients. Product offerings to clients include debt securities, loans traded in the secondary market, equity securities, derivative contracts, and other similar financial instruments. The Company elects to apply fair value accounting to trading loans. Trading loans include: (i) loans held in connection with the Company's trading business primarily consisting of commercial and corporate leveraged loans; (ii) SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii) loans made or acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business. Other trading-related activities include acting as a market maker for certain debt and equity security transactions, derivative instrument transactions, and foreign exchange transactions. Trading assets and liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized within Noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income on trading account securities is included in Interest on other earning assets. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s trading activities, see "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" and &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

Investment Securities 

The Company invests in various debt securities primarily as a store of liquidity and as part of the overall ALM process to optimize income and market performance over an entire interest rate cycle. Investments in debt securities that are not held for trading purposes are classified as HTM or AFS. Interest income on securities is recognized in income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the security. As prepayments are received, a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. 

Debt securities are classified as HTM when Truist has both the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. HTM securities are reported at amortized cost. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company transferred securities from HTM to AFS in response to changes in regulatory capital rules. 

Debt securities that may be sold to meet liquidity needs arising from unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital requirements or unforeseen changes in market conditions are classified as AFS. AFS securities are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI, net of deferred income taxes, in the Shareholders' equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses realized from the sale of AFS securities are determined by specific identification and are included in Noninterest income. 

88 Truist Financial Corporation 

Investment securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated quarterly for other-than-temporary credit impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Truist considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below amortized cost, long term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments, Truist's intent to sell and whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis. Cash flow modeling is used to evaluate non-agency securities in an unrealized loss position for potential credit impairment. These models give consideration to long-term macroeconomic factors applied to current security default rates, prepayment rates and recovery rates, and security-level performance. 

The credit component of an OTTI loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component is recognized in AOCI, net of tax, in situations where Truist does not intend to sell the security and it is more-likely-than-not that Truist will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. Subsequent to recognition of OTTI, an increase in expected cash flows is recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected life of the security based on an evaluation of the nature of the increase. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s investment securities, see "Note 4. Investment Securities,&#8221; and &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities that are not classified as trading assets or liabilities are recorded in Other assets on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values (marketable) are measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized as a component of Noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable equity securities include mutual fund investments and other publicly traded equity securities. Dividends received from mutual fund investments, other marketable equity securities and FHLB stock are recognized within Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values (nonmarketable) are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer, also referred to as the measurement alternative. Any adjustments to the carrying value of these nonmarketable equity securities are recognized in Other noninterest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. Nonmarketable equity securities include FHLB stock and other equity investments. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s equity securities, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

LHFS 

LHFS includes residential and commercial mortgage loans that management intends to sell in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. 

The Company elects to apply fair value accounting to substantially all residential and commercial mortgage loans that are originated with the intent to be sold in the secondary market. Direct loan origination fees associated with these loans are recorded as Residential mortgage and Commercial real estate related income. Direct loan origination costs are generally recorded in Personnel expense. The fair value of these loans is derived from observable current market prices when available and includes loan servicing value. When observable market prices are not available, the Company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. 

First lien residential mortgage LHFS are transferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE securitization transactions, whereby the loans are exchanged for cash or securities that are readily redeemable for cash with servicing rights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale of residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at inception of the associated interest rate lock commitments and reflect the change in value of the loans resulting from changes in interest rates from the time the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with borrowers until the loans are sold, adjusted for pull through rates and excluding hedge transactions initiated to mitigate this market risk. Commercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and FHLMC and the Company also issues and sells GNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured loans. The loans and securities are exchanged for cash with servicing rights retained. Gains and losses on sales of residential and commercial mortgage loans are included in Residential mortgage and Commercial real estate income, respectively. 

LHFS also includes specifically identified loans where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. These loans are generally recorded at LOCOM. Origination fees and costs for such loans are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the loans are classified as Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available, but may also incorporate consideration of other unobservable inputs such as indicative bids, broker price opinions or other information derived from internal or external data sources. 

Truist Financial Corporation 89 

In certain circumstances, the Company may transfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At the time of transfer, any credit losses are subject to charge-off in accordance with the Company&#8217;s policy and are recorded as a reduction in the ALLL. Any subsequent losses, including those related to interest rate or liquidity-related valuation adjustments are recorded as a component of Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s LHFS, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures." 

Loans and Leases 

The Company's accounting methods for loans differ depending on whether the loans are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since the date of origination such that it is probable at the date of acquisition that Truist will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. 

Fair values for acquired loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions were the key factors driving credit losses which were embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions were informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate was determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. All of the merged loans were marked to fair value as of the Merger date and therefore, there is no allowance related to these loans. 

Originated Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, and unamortized fees and costs. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using the effective interest method. 

Purchased Loans 

Purchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an ALLL is not recorded at the acquisition date. 

Purchased loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either purchased impaired or purchased non-impaired. PCI loans reflect credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that Truist will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. For PCI loans, expected cash flows at the acquisition date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans using a level yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income. Decreases in expected cash flows due to credit deterioration are recognized by recording an ALLL. For purchased non-impaired loans, the difference between the fair value and UPB of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using the effective interest method. In the event of prepayment, the remaining unamortized amount is recognized in interest income. 

TDRs 

&#160; 

Modifications to a borrower's debt agreement are considered TDRs if a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties that otherwise would not be considered. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan and may take the form of modifications that result in the stated interest rate being lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of normal underwriting policies and procedures, or in certain limited circumstances forgiveness of principal or interest. A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. Modifications of PCI loans that are part of a pool accounted for as a single asset are not considered TDRs. 

TDRs can involve loans remaining nonperforming, moving to nonperforming, or continuing on accruing status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower and an evaluation as to whether the borrower will be able to repay the loan based on the modified terms. The evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay the loan is based on a current, well-documented credit analysis. In circumstances where the TDR involves charging off a portion of the loan balance, the Company classifies these TDRs as nonperforming. 

90 Truist Financial Corporation 

TDR classification may be removed due to the passage of time if the loan: (1) did not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (2) has performed in accordance with the modified terms (generally a minimum of six months), (3) was reported as a TDR over a year-end reporting period, and (4) reflected an interest rate on the modified loan that was no less than a market rate at the date of modification. These loans are individually evaluated for impairment. TDR classification may also be removed for an accruing loan upon the occurrence of a subsequent non-concessionary modification granted at market terms and within current underwriting guidelines. 

NPAs 

&#160; 

NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of clients' loan defaults. 

Truist's policies for placing loans on nonperforming status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist classifies loans and leases as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past due. The following table summarizes the delinquency thresholds that are used in evaluating nonperforming classification and the timing of charge-offs (PCI loans are considered to be performing due to the application of the expected cash flows method): 

##TABLE_START (number of days) Placed on Nonperforming (1) Charged-off Commercial: Commercial and industrial 90 (2) &#160; 90 (2) &#160; CRE 90 (2) &#160; 90 (2) &#160; Commercial construction 90 (2) &#160; 90 (2) &#160; Lease financing 90 (2) &#160; 90 (2) &#160; Consumer: Residential mortgage (3) 90 to 180 90 to 210 Residential home equity and direct (3) 90 to 120 90 to 180 Indirect auto (3) 90 120 Indirect other (3) 90 to 120 120 to 180 Student (4) NA 120 to 180 Credit card NA 90 to 180 ##TABLE_END

(1) Loans may be returned to accrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and concern no longer exists as to the collectability of principal and interest, generally indicated by 180 days of sustained payment performance. 

(2) Or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, whichever occurs first. 

(3) Depends on product type, loss mitigation status, status of the government guarantee, if applicable, and certain other product-specific factors. 

(4) Government guaranteed student loans are not placed on nonperforming status or charged-off regardless of delinquency status because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. 

When commercial loans are placed on nonperforming status, a charge-off is recorded, if necessary, to decrease the carrying value of such loans to the estimated recoverable amount. Retail loans are subject to mandatory charge-off at a specified delinquency date consistent with regulatory guidelines. 

Certain past due loans may remain on accrual status if management determines that it does not have concern over the collectability of principal and interest. Generally, when loans are placed on nonperforming status, accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period and amortization of deferred loan fees and expenses is suspended. For commercial loans and certain consumer loans, payments received for interest and lending fees thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as concern exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. 

Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic revaluations of the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. Truist's policies require that valuations be updated at least annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than six months old, otherwise an update is required. Any subsequent changes in value as well as gains or losses from the disposition on these assets are recognized in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s loan and lease activities, see "Note 5. Loans and ACL.&#8221; 

Truist Financial Corporation 91 

ACL 

The ACL includes the ALLL and the RUFC. The ACL represents management's estimate of probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in internal risk ratings, expected cash flows on PCI loans, current assessment of impaired loans and leases, the results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. As part of the ACL estimation process, Truist develops a series of loss estimate factors, which are modeled projections of the frequency and severity of losses. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to the Provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loan or lease balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. 

The methodology used to determine the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the collectively evaluated component of the ALLL, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. The RUFC is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the provision associated with changes in the RUFC is recognized in the Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

While management uses the best information available to establish the ACL, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in computing the ACL. 

The portfolio segment level represents the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. Truist concluded that its loan and lease portfolio consists of four portfolio segments: commercial, consumer, credit card, and PCI. The commercial portfolio segment was identified based on the risk-based approach used to estimate the ALLL for the vast majority of these loans. The consumer portfolio segment was identified based on the delinquency-based approach used to estimate the ALLL. The credit card portfolio segment, which also uses a delinquency-based ALLL approach, was identified because of the unique nature of its lending arrangements. The PCI portfolio segment was identified based on the expected cash flows approach used to estimate the ALLL. See "Note 5. Loans and ACL" for additional information about the classes of financing receivables included within each of these loan portfolio segments. 

The entire amount of the ACL is available to absorb losses on any loan category or lending-related commitment. 

The following provides a description of accounting policies and methodologies related to each of the portfolio segments: 

Commercial 

The vast majority of loans in the commercial lending portfolio are assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrower's ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing borrowers' financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower. Risk ratings are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently for many relationships based on policy requirements regarding various risk characteristics. While this review is largely focused on the borrower's ability to repay the loan, Truist also considers the capacity and willingness of a loan's guarantors to support the debt service on the loan as a secondary source of repayment. When a guarantor exhibits the documented capacity and willingness to support the loan, Truist may consider extending the loan maturity and/or temporarily deferring principal payments if the ultimate collection of both principal and interest is not in question. In these cases, Truist may deem the loan to not be impaired due to the documented capacity and willingness of the guarantor to repay the loan. Loans are considered impaired when the borrower (or guarantor in certain circumstances) does not have the cash flow capacity or willingness to service the debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that the borrower will continue to pay according to the contractual agreement. The following table summarizes risk ratings: 

##TABLE_START Risk Rating Description Pass Loans not considered to be problem credits Special Mention Loans that have a potential weakness deserving management's close attention Substandard Loans for which a well-defined weakness has been identified that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk ##TABLE_END

Large commercial nonaccrual loans and commercial loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR are reviewed to determine the amount of specific allowance required in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The specific allowance established for these loans is based on a thorough analysis of expected cash flows which typically includes assessing the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, the loan&#8217;s estimated market value, or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated selling costs. Any change in the present value attributable to the passage of time is recognized through the Provision for credit losses. 

92 Truist Financial Corporation 

Collectively evaluated allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools based on similar characteristics. In this process, allowance factors are based on an analysis of historical charge-off experience, expected loss factors derived from the Company's internal risk rating process, portfolio trends, and regional and national economic conditions. Other adjustments may be made to the ALLL after an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. These influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting, concentration risk, macroeconomic conditions, and/or recent observable asset quality trends. 

Consumer and Revolving Credit 

The majority of the ALLL related to the consumer and revolving credit lending portfolios is calculated on a collective basis using delinquency status, which is the primary factor considered in determining whether a loan should be classified as nonperforming. Incurred loss estimates for Truist's consumer and revolving credit lending portfolios are based on estimated migration rates that are developed based on historical experience and current risk mix (e.g., prevailing delinquency rates). These estimates may be adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio trends. The remaining portion of the ALLL related to the consumer and revolving credit lending portfolios relates to loans that have been deemed impaired based on their classification as a TDR at the balance sheet date. The ALLL for consumer and revolving credit TDRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate adjustments to future cash flows that reflect management's best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based on a combination of historical experience and management judgment. 

PCI 

&#160; 

PCI loans are aggregated into loan pools based upon common risk characteristics. The ALLL for each loan pool is based on an analysis that is performed to estimate the expected cash flows. To the extent that the expected cash flows of a loan pool have decreased due to credit deterioration, Truist establishes an ALLL. 

Premises and Equipment 

&#160; 

Premises, equipment, finance leases and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and is recorded within the corresponding Noninterest expense categories on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the improvements&#8217; estimated useful lives or the lease term. 

&#160; 

Lessee operating and finance leases 

Truist has operating and finance leases for data centers, corporate offices, branches, retail centers, and certain equipment, and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases with an original lease term in excess of one year are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Premises and equipment and Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease costs are recorded in Net occupancy expense or Equipment expense based on the underlying asset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate in determining the present value of lease payments when readily determinable, and a collateralized incremental borrowing rate when an implicit rate is not available. Lease terms consider options to extend or terminate based on the determination of whether such renewal or termination options are deemed reasonably certain. 

Lease agreements that contain non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component. Variable costs, such as maintenance expenses, property and sales taxes, association dues and index based rate increases, are expensed as they are incurred. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

Life insurance policies on certain current and former directors, officers and employees, for which Truist is the owner and beneficiary are stated at the cash surrender value within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in cash surrender value and proceeds from insurance benefits are recorded in Income from bank-owned life insurance in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Truist Financial Corporation 93 

Income Taxes 

The Company&#8217;s provision for income taxes is based on income and expense reported for financial statement purposes after adjustments for permanent differences such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities, tax credits, and amortization expense related to qualified affordable housing investments. In computing the provision for income taxes, the Company evaluates the technical merits of its income tax positions based on current legislative, judicial, and regulatory guidance. The deferral method of accounting is used on investments that generate investment tax credits, such that the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related investment. Additionally, the Company recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies on employee share-based payments as a component of the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These tax effects, generally determined upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock, are treated as discrete items in the period in which they occur. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses and other income and expenses recorded in AOCI. For additional information related to the Company's unrealized gains and losses, see "Note 13. AOCI.&#8221; 

DTAs and DTLs result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. These deferred assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to apply in the periods in which the DTAs or DTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these deferred assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the Provision for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. 

Interest and penalties related to the Company&#8217;s tax positions are recognized as a component of the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s activities related to income taxes, see "Note 14. Income Taxes.&#8221; 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

&#160; 

The Company records derivative contracts at fair value in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether or not it has been designated in a formal, qualifying hedging relationship. 

Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized within Noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This includes derivatives that the Company enters into in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions and as a risk management tool to economically hedge certain identified risks associated with assets carried at fair value such as MSRs, along with certain interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage and commercial loans that are a normal part of the Company&#8217;s operations. The Company also evaluates contracts, such as brokered deposits and debt, to determine whether any embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for as freestanding derivatives. 

Certain derivatives used as risk management tools are designated as accounting hedges and are used to mitigate the Company&#8217;s exposure to changes in interest rates or other identified market risks. The Company prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges of (i) changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge) attributable to a specified risk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness, along with support for management&#8217;s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. Methodologies related to hedge effectiveness include (i) statistical regression analysis of changes in the cash flows of the actual derivative and hypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical regression analysis of changes in the fair values of the actual derivative and the hedged item. Prior to third quarter of 2019, the Company also used the shortcut method for hedges with matched terms that permitted the assumption of no ineffectiveness. 

For designated hedging relationships, subsequent to the initial assessment of hedge effectiveness, the Company generally performs retrospective and prospective effectiveness testing using a qualitative approach on a quarterly basis. 

94 Truist Financial Corporation 

Below is a summary of the cash flow and fair value hedge programs utilized by Truist: 

##TABLE_START Cash Flow Hedges Fair Value Hedges Risk exposure Variability in cash flows of interest payments on floating rate loans, overnight funding and various LIBOR funding instruments. Changes in value on fixed rate long-term debt, FHLB advances, loans and state and political subdivision securities due to changes in interest rates. Risk management objective Hedge the variability in the interest payments and receipts on future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the first unhedged payments and receipts of variable interest due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. Convert the fixed rate paid or received to a floating rate, primarily through the use of swaps. Treatment during the hedge period Changes in value of the hedging instruments are recognized in AOCI until the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. The amount reclassified to earnings is recorded in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Changes in value of both the hedging instruments and the assets or liabilities being hedged are recognized in the income statement line item associated with the instrument being hedged. Treatment if hedge ceases to be highly effective or is terminated Hedge is dedesignated. Changes in value recorded in AOCI before dedesignation are amortized to yield over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If hedged item remains outstanding, the basis adjustment that resulted from hedging is amortized into earnings over the lesser of the designated hedged period or the maturity date of the instrument, and cash flows from terminations are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item. Treatment if transaction is no longer probable of occurring during forecast period or within a short period thereafter Hedge accounting ceases and any gain or loss in AOCI is recognized in earnings immediately. Not applicable ##TABLE_END

Derivatives expose the Company to risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract does not perform as expected. The Company manages its exposures to counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with defined exposure limits based on their credit quality and in accordance with established policies and procedures. All counterparties are reviewed regularly as part of the Company&#8217;s credit risk management practices and appropriate action is taken to adjust the exposure limits to certain counterparties as necessary. The Company&#8217;s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA agreements or other legally enforceable industry standard master netting agreements. In certain cases and depending on the nature of the underlying derivative transactions, bilateral collateral agreements are also utilized. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to OTC derivative clearing requirements, which require certain derivatives to be cleared through central clearing houses. These clearing houses require the Company to post initial and variation margin to mitigate the risk of non-payment, the latter of which is received or paid daily based on the net asset or liability of the contracts. Beginning in 2017, the Company adopted settlement to market treatment for the cash collateralizing derivative contracts with certain centrally cleared counterparties. Derivative balances with these counterparties are considered settled by the collateral, and the implementation of the settlement to market treatment was applied based on the effective date of rulebook changes made by the applicable counterparties. 

When the Company has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, and there exists a legal right of offset with that counterparty, the Company considers its exposure to the counterparty to be the net fair value of its derivative positions with that counterparty. If the net fair value is positive, then the corresponding asset value also reflects cash collateral held. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, the Company adopted a policy to offset derivative transactions with a single counterparty as well as any cash collateral paid to and received from that counterparty for derivative contracts that are subject to ISDA or other legally enforceable netting arrangements and meet accounting guidance for offsetting treatment. 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivative activities, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; and "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.&#8221; 

Truist Financial Corporation 95 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as business combinations. Truist allocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment as of October 1st of each year and more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate a possible reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. If, after assessing all relevant events or circumstances, Truist concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value, then an impairment test is required. Truist may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the impairment test. Truist measures impairment using the present value of estimated future cash flows. Discount rates are based upon the cost of capital specific to the industry in which the reporting unit operates. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is performed, which measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value. 

CDI and other intangible assets include premiums paid for acquisitions of core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, are amortized over their useful lives, based upon the estimated economic benefits received. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s activities related to goodwill and other intangibles, see "Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#8221; 

MSRs 

Truist has two classes of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. Both classes of MSRs are accounted for primarily at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Residential mortgage income and Commercial real estate related income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of servicing rights is impacted by a variety of factors, including prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually-specified servicing fees, servicing costs, and underlying portfolio characteristics. These risks are hedged with various derivative instruments that are intended to mitigate the income statement effect to changes in fair value. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties and comparisons to market transactions. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s servicing rights, see "Note 8. Loan Servicing.&#8221; 

Fair Value Measurement 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value. The Company classifies inputs used in valuation techniques within the fair value hierarchy discussed in "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

When measuring assets and liabilities at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis include trading securities, derivative instruments, AFS securities, and certain other equity securities. Assets and liabilities that the Company has elected to measure at fair value on a recurring basis include trading loans, loans originated to be sold and classified as LHFS, and residential and commercial MSRs. Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as when assets are evaluated for impairment, the basis of accounting is lower of cost or market, or for disclosure purposes. Examples of these non-recurring fair value measurements include certain LHFS and loans and leases held for investment, OREO, certain cost or equity method investments, and intangible and long-lived assets. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s valuation of assets and liabilities held at fair value, see "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.&#8221; 

Equity-Based Compensation 

&#160; 

Truist maintains various equity-based compensation plans that provide for the granting of RSAs, RSUs and PSUs to selected employees and directors. Truist values share-based awards at the grant date fair value and recognizes the expense over the requisite service period taking into account retirement eligibility. Compensation expense is recognized in Personnel expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation plans, see "Note 15. Benefit Plans.&#8221; 

96 Truist Financial Corporation 

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 

Truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. The discount rate assumption used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high quality corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plan such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests, adjusted for the weight of each asset class in the target mix. 

Revenue Recognition 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company recognizes two primary types of revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Income, Interest income and Noninterest income. The Company&#8217;s principal source of revenue is interest income from loans and securities, which is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. For information on the Company&#8217;s policies for recognizing interest income on loans and securities, see the &#8220;Loans and Leases,&#8221; &#8220;LHFS,&#8221; &#8220;Trading Activities,&#8221; and &#8220;Investment Securities&#8221; sections within this Note. 

Noninterest income includes revenue from various types of transactions and services provided to clients. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers as performance obligations identified are satisfied. Performance obligations are typically satisfied in one year or less. We have elected the practical expedient to expense the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. As of December 31, 2019, remaining performance obligations consisted primarily of insurance and investment banking services for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 

Insurance income 

Insurance commissions are received on the sale of insurance products as agent or broker, and revenue is recognized at a point in time upon the placement date of the insurance policies, representing the Company&#8217;s related performance obligations. Payment is normally received within the policy period. In addition to placement, Truist also provides insurance policy related risk management services. The Company&#8217;s execution of these risk management services represents its performance obligations. Revenue is recognized over time as these services are provided. Performance-based commissions are recognized when received or earlier when, upon consideration of past results and current conditions, the revenue is deemed not probable of reversal. Insurance commissions are included in the IH operating segment. Refer to &#8220;Note 21. Operating Segments&#8221; for information on segments results. 

Transaction and service-based revenues 

Transaction and service-based revenues include service charges on deposits, wealth management income, card and payment related fees, and investment banking income. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the transactions occur or over time as services are performed over primarily monthly or quarterly periods. Payment is typically received in the period the transactions occur or, in some cases, within 90 days of the service period. Fees may be fixed or, where applicable, based on a percentage of transaction size or managed assets. These revenues, and their relationship to the Company&#8217;s operating segments, are further described by type below. Refer to &#8220;Note 21. Operating Segments&#8221; for information on segments results. 

Service charges on deposits include account maintenance, cash and treasury management, wire transfers, ATM, overdraft and other deposit-related fees. The Company&#8217;s execution of the services related to these fees represents its performance obligations. Each of these performance obligations are either satisfied over time or at a point in time as the services are provided to the client. The Company is the principal when rendering these services. Payments for services provided are either withdrawn from client accounts as services are rendered or in the billing period following the completion of the service. The transaction price for each of these fees is based on the Company&#8217;s predetermined fee schedules. Service charges on deposits are recognized in the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB operating segments. 

Wealth management income includes trust and investment management income, retail investment and brokerage services, and investment advisory and other specialty wealth management fees. The Company&#8217;s execution of these services represents its related performance obligations. The Company generally recognizes trust and investment management and advisory revenue over time as services are rendered based on either a percentage of the market value of the assets under management or advisement, or fixed based on the services provided to the client. Fees are generally swept from the client&#8217;s account one billing period in arrears based on the prior period&#8217;s asset balances under management or advisement. The Company also offers selling and distribution services and earns commissions through the sale of annuity and mutual fund products, acting as agent in these transactions and recognizing revenue at a point in time when the client enters into an agreement with the product carrier. The Company may also receive trailing commissions and 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and annuity products and recognizes this revenue in the period earned. Retail trade execution commissions are earned and recognized on the trade date with payment on the settlement date. Wealth management income is included in the CB&#38;W operating segment.

Card and payment related fees include interchange fees from credit and debit cards, merchant acquirer revenue, and other card related services. Interchange fees are earned by the Company each time a request for payment is initiated by a client at a merchant for which the Company transfers the funds on behalf of the client. Interchange rates are set by the payment network and are based on purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees are received daily and recognized at a point in time when the card transaction is processed, which represents the Company&#8217;s related performance obligation. The Company is considered an agent of the client and incurs costs with the payment network to facilitate the interchange with the merchant; therefore, the related payment network expense is recognized as a reduction of card fees. Truist also offers rewards and/or rebates to its client based on card usage. The costs associated with these programs are recognized as a reduction of card fees. Card and payment related fees are recognized in the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB operating segments. 

Investment banking and trading income includes securities underwriting fees, advisory fees, loan syndication fees, and trade execution services revenue. Underwriting fees are earned on the trade date when the Company, as a member of an underwriting syndicate, purchases the securities from the issuer and sells the securities to third party investors. Each member of the syndicate is responsible for selling its portion of the underwriting and is liable for the proportionate costs of the underwriting; therefore, the Company&#8217;s portion of underwriting revenue and expense is presented gross within noninterest income and noninterest expense. The transaction price is based on a percentage of the total transaction amount and payments are settled shortly after the trade date. Fees for merger and acquisition advisory services, including various activities such as business valuation, identification of potential targets or acquirers, and the issuance of fairness opinions, are generally earned and recognized by the Company when performance obligations are satisfied. The Company&#8217;s execution of the advisory services related to these fees represents its performance obligations. The Company is the principal when rendering these services. The transaction price is based on contractually specified terms agreed upon with the client for each advisory service. Loan syndication fees are typically recognized at the closing of a loan syndication transaction. Revenue related to corporate trade execution services is earned and recognized on the trade date with payment on the settlement date. Investment banking and trading income is included in the C&#38;CB operating segment. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, plus common share equivalents calculated for stock options, warrants, and restricted stock outstanding using the treasury stock method. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s EPS, see "Note 20. Computation of EPS.&#8221; 

Related Party Transactions 

The Company periodically enters into transactions with certain of its executive officers, directors, affiliates, trusts, and/or other related parties in its ordinary course of business. The Company is required to disclose material related party transactions, other than certain compensation and other arrangements entered into in the normal course of business. Information related to the Company&#8217;s relationships with VIEs and employee benefit plan arrangements is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Subsequent Events 

The Company evaluated events that occurred between December 31, 2019 and the date the accompanying financial statements were issued, and there were no material events, other than those already discussed, that would require recognition in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the accompanying Notes.

Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements 

##TABLE_START Standard Description Effects on the Financial Statements Standard Adopted January 1, 2019 Leases Requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities related to certain operating leases on the balance sheet, requires additional disclosures by lessees, and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. Truist established ROU assets of $860 million and lease liabilities of $997 million. The impact to equity, net of tax, was a reduction of $31 million. There was no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Income. Truist adopted the guidance on a prospective basis and did not reassess whether any expired or existing contract contains a lease, the classification of leases or the initial direct costs. Standards Adopted January 1, 2020 Credit Losses Replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with an expected credit loss methodology and requires consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Financial assets measured at amortized cost will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses. Purchased credit deteriorated loans will receive an allowance for expected credit losses. Any credit impairment on AFS debt securities for which the fair value is less than cost will be recorded through an allowance for expected credit losses. The standard also requires expanded disclosures related to credit losses and asset quality. Truist adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $2.9 billion increase to the ACL and a $2.1 billion decrease to Retained earnings adjusted for deferred taxes and other impacts, which will be reflected in the Company's first quarter 2020 financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the AFS securities portfolio. Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment Simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill, by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The standard requires an entity to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, with the loss limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard must be applied on a prospective basis. The standard does not currently have an impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements; however, if subsequent to adoption, the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value, the Company would be required to recognize an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. ##TABLE_END

NOTE 2. Business Combinations 

Effective December 6, 2019, the Company completed its previously announced Merger with SunTrust pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 7, 2019 and amended as of June 14, 2019. Upon closing, each SunTrust share was exchanged for 1.295 shares of BB&#38;T stock. At the closing, SunTrust merged with and into BB&#38;T, with BB&#38;T continuing as the surviving corporation. In connection with the Merger, the Company changed its name from BB&#38;T Corporation to Truist Financial Corporation. Following the Merger, on December 7, 2019, SunTrust Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunTrust, merged with and into Branch Bank, with Branch Bank continuing as the surviving bank. In connection with the Merger, Branch Bank changed its name to Truist Bank. SunTrust was incorporated in the State of Georgia and its principal operating subsidiary was SunTrust Bank. The Truist Board of Directors consists of 22 directors with 11 members from each heritage Company's Board. 

In connection with the Merger, certain equity awards held by SunTrust employees were converted into Truist equity awards, with the number of shares underlying such award adjusted based on the exchange ratio. Converted equity awards will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding SunTrust equity award, except that, in the case of SunTrust performance stock unit awards, the number of shares underlying the converted Company equity award was determined based on actual performance through September 30, 2019 and target performance for the balance of the applicable performance period and such award will continue to vest after the Merger solely based on service. 

Upon closing, each outstanding share of perpetual preferred stock issued by SunTrust was converted into the right to receive one share of an applicable newly issued series of Truist preferred stock having substantially the same terms as such share of SunTrust preferred stock. The Company issued series I, J, K, L and M non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a total par and fair value of $ 2.0 billion on the Merger closing date. Refer to "Note 12. Shareholders' Equity" for additional information related to the preferred share issuance.

The Merger has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their fair values as of the Merger date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. Due to the timing of the transaction closing date and the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete and the Company&#8217;s purchase price allocation is considered preliminary. Fair value estimates related to the acquired assets and liabilities are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the Merger as additional information becomes available. Valuations subject to change include, but are not limited to, loans, certain deposits, certain other assets, customer relationships, purchased credit card receivables and the core deposit intangible. Immaterial amounts of the intangible assets recognized are deductible for income tax purposes.

The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities. 

Cash and cash equivalents; Interest-bearing deposits with banks, and Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements: The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. 

Trading assets and AFS Securities: Fair values for trading and AFS securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar instruments, quoted market prices that are not in an active market or other inputs that are observable in the market. In the absence of observable inputs, fair value is estimated based on pricing models and/or discounted cash flow methodologies. The majority of AFS securities were priced by third-party vendors whereas trading securities are priced internally. All securities are subject to IPV. Trading loans are valued primarily using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third-party pricing service. 

&#160; 

LHFS: The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted for servicing, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 

Truist Financial Corporation 101 

Loans and leases: Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions were the key factors driving credit losses which were embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions were informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate was determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rates do not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. All of the merged loans were marked to fair value as of the Merger date and therefore, there is no allowance related to these loans. 

CDI: This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships with certain deposit clients. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected client attrition rates, cost of the deposit base, reserve requirements, net maintenance cost attributable to client deposits and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources. The discount rates used for CDI assets are based on current market rates. The CDI is being amortized over 10 years based upon the estimated economic benefits received. 

MSRs: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Commercial MSRs are valued using a cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows. 

Deposits: The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the Merger date. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

Short-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings are reasonable estimates of fair value based on the short-term nature of these liabilities. The fair value of securities sold short is determined in the same manner as trading securities. 

Long-term debt : The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 

Preferred stock: The fair values of preferred stock are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instruments. 

Branch Divestitures 

In connection with the merger, on November 8, 2019, BB&#38;T and SunTrust announced that, subject to closing and other customary closing conditions, First Horizon Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of First Horizon National Corporation, entered into an agreement to acquire 30 branches located in North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia from SunTrust Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of SunTrust, to satisfy regulatory requirements in connection with the Merger. There are approximately $400 million in loans and leases and $2.4 billion in deposits that will be divested as part of this transaction, which is expected to close in 2020. 

Pro Forma Financial Information 

The following table presents unaudited pro forma results as if the merger between BB&#38;T and SunTrust occurred on January 1, 2018 and includes the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated purchase accounting adjustments such as intangible assets as well as fair value adjustments to loans, deposits, and long-term debt. Merger-related expenses that occurred at the effective date of the Merger or subsequent to the Merger are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred $298 million of costs related to the Merger which were included in Merger-related and restructuring charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and consisted primarily of advisory, legal, banker, and accounting and consulting fees. These costs include $127 million of costs directly related to the transaction, which are reflected in the the year ended December 31, 2018 in the table below. Cost savings are not reflected in the pro forma amounts.

NOTE 3. Securities Financing Activities 

Securities purchased under resale agreements are primarily collateralized by U.S. government or agency securities and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold, plus accrued interest. Securities borrowed are primarily collateralized by corporate securities. The Company borrows securities and purchases securities under agreements to resell as part of its securities financing activities. On the acquisition date of these securities, the Company and the related counterparty agree on the amount of collateral required to secure the principal amount loaned under these arrangements. The following table presents securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements: 

##TABLE_START December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 986 &#160; &#160; $ 143 &#160; &#160; Securities borrowed 431 &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; Total securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements $ 1,417 &#160; &#160; $ 143 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END 

For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Company would be obligated to provide additional collateral in the event of a significant decline in fair value of the collateral pledged. This risk is managed by monitoring the liquidity and credit quality of the collateral, as well as the maturity profile of the transactions. Refer to "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information related to pledged securities. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as secured borrowings. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s related activity, by collateral type and remaining contractual maturity:

Substantially all of the unrealized losses on the securities portfolio were the result of changes in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers or underlying loans. At December 31, 2019, the Company did not intend to sell these securities nor was it more-likely-than-not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery or maturity.

The Company has undertaken a number of strategic actions to enhance the credit quality and interest-rate sensitivity of its loan and lease portfolio. During the third quarter of 2019, management sold a $ 4.3 billion residential mortgage loan portfolio. This sale was followed by a number of balance sheet restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019, including the transfer of: 

&#8226; $ 2.5 billion of residential mortgage loans to LHFS, 

&#8226; $ 356 million of commercial loans to LHFS as a result of a decision to exit a business, and 

&#8226; $ 381 million of mortgage, consumer and commercial loans to LHFS related to the forthcoming branch divestiture arising from the Merger. 

106 Truist Financial Corporation 

The following table presents the carrying amount of loans by risk rating and performing status. Student loans are excluded as there is nominal risk of credit loss due to government guarantees or other credit enhancements. PCI loans were excluded because their related ALLL is determined by loan pool performance and revolving credit loans were excluded as the loans are charged-off rather than reclassifying these loans to nonperforming:

NOTE 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to operating segments are reflected in the table below. Based on the results of the impairment assessments, there were no impairments for the periods presented. Truist did not observe any factors that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its respective carrying amount as of period-end. For 2019, the goodwill added for mergers and acquisitions primarily relates to the Merger. Effective at the close of the Merger, the operating segments were realigned and goodwill allocated to the new segments based on the relative fair value of the underlying reporting units, as applicable. Refer to "Note 2. Business Combinations" and "Note 21. Operating Segments" for additional information. For 2018, the goodwill added for mergers and acquisitions relates to the July 2, 2018, acquisition of Regions Insurance from Regions Financial Corporation, which resulted in $ 201 million of goodwill and$ 175 million of identifiable intangible assets in the IH segment.

NOTE 8. Loan Servicing 

The Company acquires servicing rights and retains servicing rights for certain of its sales or securitizations of residential mortgages and commercial loans. Servicing rights on residential and commercial mortgages are capitalized by the Company as MSRs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income earned by the Company on its residential MSRs is derived primarily from contractually specified mortgage servicing fees and late fees, net of curtailment costs. Income earned by the Company on its commercial mortgage servicing rights is derived primarily from contractually specified servicing fees and other ancillary fees.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the above table, the effect of an adverse variation in one assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the effect of the change. See "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures" for additional information on the valuation techniques used.

NOTE 12. Shareholders' Equity 

Preferred Stock 

On July 29, 2019, the Company issued $ 1.7 billion of series N non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a stated dividend rate of 4.800 % per annum for net proceeds of $ 1.7 billion. The Company issued depositary shares, each of which represents a fractional ownership interest in a share of the 68,000 shares of the Company's series N preferred stock. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption is solely at the option of the Company in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined. In addition, the preferred stock may be redeemed in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date after September 1, 2024. Refer to the table below for additional details regarding the preferred shares and dividends. 

During the third quarter of 2019, the Company redeemed all outstanding 23,000 shares of series D and 46,000 shares of series E non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the corresponding depositary shares representing fractional interests in each series for $ 1.7 billion. Regular dividends on the redeemed shares were paid during the third quarter of 2019. In connection with the redemptions, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $ 46 million to recognize the difference in the redemption price and the carrying value. 

Upon closing of the Merger, each outstanding share of SunTrust perpetual preferred stock was converted into the right to receive one share of an applicable newly issued series of Truist preferred stock having substantially the same terms as such share of SunTrust preferred stock. The Company issued series I, J, K, L and M non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a total par and fair value of $ 2.0 billion on the Merger closing date. Refer to the table below for additional details regarding the preferred shares and dividends and "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional information related to the Merger. 

On February 10, 2020, the Company announced its intention to redeem all outstanding 5,000 shares of its perpetual preferred stock series K and the corresponding depositary shares representing fractional interests in each series for $ 500 million plus any unpaid dividends on March 16, 2020. The preferred stock redemption is in accordance with the terms of the Company&#8217;s Articles of Amendment to its Restated Articles of Incorporation, effective as of December 6, 2019.

Share Repurchase Plan Activity 

&#160; 

Truist suspended its share repurchase program in 2019 to build capital for the Merger and does not anticipate that share repurchases will resume until capital ratios return to higher levels. During 2018, the Company repurchased $ 1.2 billion of common stock, which represented 23.2 million shares, through a combination of open market and accelerated share repurchases. During 2017, the Company repurchased $ 1.6 billion of common stock, which represented 35.5 million shares, through a combination of open market and accelerated share repurchases. Repurchased shares revert to the status of authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. These assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted federal and state tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the DTAs or DTLs are expected to be realized. The net deferred income tax liability is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The significant DTAs and DTLs, net of the federal impact for state taxes, are presented in the following table. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

The DTAs include Federal and state NOLs and other state carryforwards that will expire, if not utilized, in varying amounts from 2020 to 2039. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a valuation allowance recorded against its state carryforwards and certain state DTAs of $ 130 million. The increase in the valuation allowance is primarily due to the heritage SunTrust valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards. 

The following table provides a rollforward of the Company's gross federal and state UTBs, excluding interest and penalties: 

##TABLE_START December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Balance, January 1 $ 2 &#160; &#160; $ 1 &#160; &#160; Increases in UTBs related to prior years 120 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; Increases in UTBs related to the current year 6 &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; Decreases in UTBs related to settlements ( 1 ) &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; Balance, December 31 $ 127 &#160; &#160; $ 2 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END

The increase in UTBs related to prior years is primarily due to the Merger. The amount of UTBs that would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized, was $ 99 million at December 31, 2019. 

Interest and penalties related to UTBs are recorded in the Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company had a gross liability of $ 11 million for interest and penalties related to its unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019. The increase in the liability was primarily due to the Merger. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a gross expense of $ 1 million related to interest and penalties on the UTBs. 

120 Truist Financial Corporation 

The Company files U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns. The Company's federal income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by the IRS for taxable years prior to 2016. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2013. It is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $ 25 million during the next 12 months due to completion of tax authority examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitations. It is uncertain how much, if any, of this potential decrease will impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. 

NOTE 15. Benefit Plans 

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans 

&#160; 

Truist provides defined benefit retirement plans qualified under the IRC that cover most employees. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employee's compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment. The Company's retirement plans obtained through the Merger remained separate as of December 31, 2019. 

&#160; 

In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the IRC. Although technically unfunded plans, Rabbi Trusts and insurance policies on the lives of certain of the covered employees are available to finance future benefits. 

Active Retirement Plan s 

Financial data relative to qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans is summarized in the following tables for the years indicated. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the qualified pension plan net asset is recorded as a component of Other assets and the nonqualified pension plans net liability is recorded as a component of Other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31.

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Truist considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data for each asset category, as well as historical actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long-term rate of return for the plan based on target asset allocations contained in the Company's Investment Policy Statement. For 2020, the expected rate of return on plan assets is 6.9 %.

Affected teammates continue to participate in the nonqualified plan for benefits earned in 2017 and later. In conjunction with this shift, a minimum benefit was established under the qualified plan which was discontinued at December 31, 2019.

Truist makes contributions to the qualified pension plan in amounts between the minimum required for funding and the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. Truist made discretionary contributions of $ 305 million during the first quarter of 2020. Management may make additional contributions in 2020. For the nonqualified plans, the employer contributions are based on benefit payments.

&#160; 

The Company's primary total return objective is to achieve returns that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The plan assets have a long-term time horizon that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon that extends well beyond a full market cycle, and can assume an above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard deviation of annual return. The investments are broadly diversified among economic sector, industry, quality and size in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Within approved guidelines and restrictions, investment managers have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments. 

Truist periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment policy and makes changes to its target asset allocation. Truist has established guidelines within each asset category to ensure the appropriate balance of risk and reward. The fair values of pension plan assets by asset category for the qualified plan are reflected in the table below. Amounts carried using net asset values and accrued income are excluded from the table.

(1) The plan may hold up to 10% of its assets in Truist common stock. 

International equity securities include a common/commingled fund that consists of assets from several accounts, pooled together, to reduce management and administration costs. Investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share or equivalent as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. The plan held alternative investments valued using net asset values totaling $ 341 million and $ 274 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Inactive Retirement Plan s 

The Company maintains a frozen and funded noncontributory qualified retirement plan, obtained from SunTrust in the Merger. The SunTrust retirement plan covers employees meeting certain service requirements. Benefits are based on salary and years of service. The plan includes a cash balance formula where personal pension accounts continue to be credited with interest each year. 

The Company also maintains, as a result of the Merger, various frozen, unfunded, noncontributory nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans that cover key officers and provide benefits based on salary and years of service. 

Certain health care and life insurance benefits are provided to retired employees. At the option of the Company, retirees may continue certain health and life insurance benefits if they meet specific age and service requirements at the time of retirement. The health care plans are contributory with participant contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plans are noncontributory. Certain retiree health benefits are funded in a Retiree Health Trust. Additionally, certain retiree life insurance benefits are funded in a VEBA.

Defined Contribution Plans 

&#160; 

Truist offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution plans that permit employees to contribute up to 50 % of their cash compensation. For full-time employees who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, Truist makes matching contributions of up to 6 % of the employee's compensation. The Company's contribution expense for the 401(k) Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $ 152 million, $ 141 million and $ 133 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Certain employees of subsidiaries participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan with different matching formulas. 

The heritage SunTrust 401(k) plan assumed in the Merger also provided for matching contributions of up to 6 % of the employee's compensation. SunTrust also maintained a deferred compensation plan for certain executives that was assumed in the Merger. 

Equity-Based Compensation Plans 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2019, RSAs, RSUs and PSUs were outstanding from equity-based compensation plans that have been approved by shareholders and plans assumed from acquired entities. Those plans are intended to assist the Company in recruiting and retaining employees, directors and independent contractors and to associate the interests of eligible participants with those of Truist and its shareholders. 

&#160; 

The majority of outstanding awards and awards available to be issued relate to plans that allow for accelerated vesting of awards for holders who retire and have met all retirement eligibility requirements or in connection with certain other events. Until vested, certain of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances. 

&#160; 

The following table provides a summary of the equity-based compensation plans:

The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the common stock price on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends that will be foregone during the vesting period. Substantially all awards are granted in February of each year. Grants to non-executive employees primarily consist of RSUs.

NOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies 

Tax Credit and Certain Equity Investments 

Truist utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees and derivatives. Truist also has commitments to fund certain affordable housing investments and contingent liabilities related to certain sold loans. 

The Company invests in certain affordable housing projects throughout its market area as a means of supporting local communities. Truist receives tax credits related to these investments, for which the Company typically acts as a limited partner and therefore does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. Truist typically provides financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. Tax credits are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level. Truist's maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity, exclusive of any potential tax recapture associated with the investments. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as the Company's other loans and are generally secured. 

Additionally, the Company invests in multi-family affordable housing partnership developments and other community development entities as a limited partner and/or a lender. The Company receives tax credits for its limited partner investments. The Company has determined that the majority of the related partnerships are VIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these investments. Truist uses the equity method of accounting for these investments. 

126 Truist Financial Corporation 

The Company also invests in entities that promote renewable energy sources as a limited partner. Tax credits received for these investments are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of these investments. The Company has determined that these renewable energy tax credit partnerships are VIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' financial performance and therefore, it is not required to consolidate these VIEs. The Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss related to these investments is limited to its equity investments in these partnerships and any additional unfunded equity commitments. 

Truist has investments in and future funding commitments related to private equity and certain other equity method investments. The majority of these investments are private equity funds that are consolidated in Truist's financial statements. The risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and future funding commitments made. 

The following table summarizes certain tax credit, private equity, and certain other equity method investments:

Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees 

In the normal course of business, Truist utilizes certain financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to risks. Such financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial guarantee arrangements. 

Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit are primarily lines of credit to businesses and consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse change clauses, which allow Truist to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers' creditworthiness. The fair values of commitments are estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated based on the counterparties' creditworthiness and average default rates for loan products with similar risks. Consumer lending and revolving credit commitments have an immaterial fair value as Truist typically has the ability to cancel such commitments. 

Truist has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain recourse provisions. These provisions generally require Truist to reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred after the disposal of the property. Truist also issues standard representations and warranties related to mortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for additional disclosures related to these exposures. 

Truist Financial Corporation 127 

Letters of credit and financial guarantees are unconditional commitments issued by Truist to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and, as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. 

The following is a summary of selected notional amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments: 

##TABLE_START December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit $ 177,598 &#160; &#160; $ 72,435 &#160; &#160; Residential mortgage loans sold with recourse 371 &#160; &#160; 419 &#160; &#160; CRE mortgages serviced for others covered by recourse provisions 8,676 &#160; &#160; 4,699 &#160; &#160; Letters of credit 5,181 &#160; &#160; 2,389 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END

Total Return Swaps 

Truist enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" and "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments." 

The Company facilitates matched book TRS transactions on behalf of clients, whereby a VIE purchases reference assets identified by a client and the Company enters into a TRS with the VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the client. The TRS contract between the VIE and the Company hedges the Company's exposure to the TRS contract with its third party client. The Company provides senior financing to the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund the purchase of the reference assets. The TRS contracts pass through interest and other cash flows on the reference assets to the third party clients, along with exposing those clients to decreases in value on the assets and providing them with the rights to appreciation on the assets. The terms of the TRS contracts require the third parties to post initial margin collateral, as well as ongoing margin as the fair values of the underlying reference assets change. 

The Company concluded that the VIEs should be consolidated because the Company has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses, and the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant. At December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected $ 2.7 billion of assets and $ 116 million of other liabilities of the VIEs. Assets at December 31, 2019 include $ 2.6 billion in trading loans. The activities of the VIEs are restricted to buying and selling the reference assets and the risks/benefits of any such assets owned by the VIEs are passed to the third party clients via the TRS contracts. 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s TRS contracts and its involvement with these VIEs, see "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.&#8221; 

Other Commitments 

Truist holds public funds in certain states that do not require 100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting uncollateralized deposit shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon the public deposits held by each bank within the respective state) by the remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that state. Truist monitors deposits levels relative to the total public deposits held by all depository institutions within these states. 

&#160; 

In the ordinary course of business, Truist indemnifies its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from pending litigation. Truist also issues standard representations and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnification arrangements provide similar indemnifications to Truist. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, Truist does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial position or results of operations of Truist. 

As a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock. The board of directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase Truist's investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future investments in the FLHB stock are not determinable.

The Company entered into an agreement to purchase its new headquarters building in Charlotte, North Carolina for $ 456 million. The purchase is projected to close in the first half of 2020. 

Pledged Assets 

&#160; 

Certain assets were pledged to secure municipal deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, certain derivative agreements, and borrowings and borrowing capacity, subject to any applicable asset discount, at the FHLB and FRB as well as for other purposes as required or permitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB provide for secured borrowing access and FHLB letters of credit, which in turn can be used to secure various client deposits, including public fund relationships. The following table provides the total carrying amount of pledged assets by asset type. Excluding assets related to employee benefit plans, the majority of the agreements governing the pledged assets do not permit the other party to sell or repledge the collateral. Heritage SunTrust collateral previously pledged to the FRB of Atlanta was not pledged to the FRB of Richmond prior to year-end. Additional assets were pledged to the FRB of Richmond in the first quarter of 2020.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

Truist and/or its subsidiaries are routinely parties to numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory investigations, arising from the ordinary conduct of its regular business activities. The matters range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with multiple class members and can involve claims for substantial amounts. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation and may consist of a variety of claims, including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims, and the ultimate resolution of any proceedings is uncertain and inherently difficult to predict. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows of Truist. 

In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, Truist establishes accruals for legal matters when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the amounts that Truist has currently accrued. On a quarterly basis, Truist evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings to assess litigation accruals and adjust such accruals upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on our best judgment after consultation with counsel and others, as warranted. 

The Company estimates of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued, range from zero to approximately $ 210 million as of December 31, 2019. This estimated range is based upon currently available information and involves considerable judgment, given that claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete, and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated, among other factors. In addition, the matters underlying this estimated range will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from this estimate. For the same reasons stated above, we do not believe that an estimate of reasonably possible losses can be made for certain matters and therefore such matters are not reflected in the range provided here. 

The following is a description of certain legal proceedings for which Truist is involved:

Bickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank 

This class action case was filed in the Fulton County State Court on July 12, 2010, and an amended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010. Plaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees charged to his account which related to debit card and ATM transactions are actually interest charges and therefore subject to the usury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought claims for violations of civil and criminal usury laws, conversion, and money had and received. On October 6, 2017, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification and defined the class as &#8220;Every Georgia citizen who had or has one or more accounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or debit card transaction (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a refund of those Fees.&#8221; The Company believes that the claims are without merit and is preparing for discovery to begin in the case. 

NOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions 

&#160; 

Truist Bank is required by the FRB to maintain reserve balances in the form of vault cash or deposits with the FRB based on specified percentages of certain deposit types, subject to various adjustments. At December 31, 2019, the net reserve requirement was met with a combination of vault cash and balances held at the FRB. 

&#160; 

Truist Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain "well-capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations. Truist does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of Truist Bank to pay dividends. 

&#160; 

Truist is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary-actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Truist's capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Truist is in full compliance with these requirements. Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for IDIs: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Truist and Truist Bank were classified as "well-capitalized," and management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to year end that would change this designation. 

&#160; 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Truist to maintain minimum ratios of CET1 ratio of 4.5 %, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 %, Total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0 %, and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio) of 4.0 %. Truist and Truist Bank are also subject to a 2.5 % capital conservation buffer that became applicable on January 1, 2016 and was phased-in through December 31, 2018. The capital conservation buffer is an amount above the minimum levels designed to ensure that banks remain well-capitalized, even in adverse economic scenarios. 

&#160; 

Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

&#160; 

As an approved seller/servicer, Truist Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of capital, as specified by various agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Truist Bank's capital was above all required levels. &#160;

NOTE 18. Fair Value Disclosures 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

Accounting standards define fair value as the exchange price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level measurement hierarchy: 

&#8226; Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 

&#8226; Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 

&#8226; Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 

The following tables present fair value information for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

(1) Refer to "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments" for additional discussion on netting adjustments. 

The following discussion focuses on the valuation techniques and significant inputs for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Available for Sale and Trading Securities: Securities accounted for at fair value include both the available-for-sale and trading portfolios. The Company uses prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to estimate the fair value of securities. The majority of AFS securities were priced by third-party vendors whereas trading securities are priced internally. All securities are subject to IPV. Management independently evaluates the fair values provided by the pricing service through comparisons to other external pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on any security sales to the daily pricing information received from the pricing service. Fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security. As described by security type below, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. In the event that market observable data was not available, which would generally occur due to the lack of an active market for a given security, the valuation of the security would be subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management. 

Trading loans: The Company has elected to measure trading loans at fair value. Trading loans are valued primarily using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third-party pricing service. Trading loans include: 

&#8226; loans held in connection with the Company's trading business primarily consisting of commercial and corporate leveraged loans; 

&#8226; SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government; and 

&#8226; loans made or acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business. 

&#160; 

U.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities are valued using quoted prices in active over-the-counter markets. 

&#160; 

132 Truist Financial Corporation 

GSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities consist of debt obligations issued by HUD, the FHLB, and other agencies, as well as securities collateralized by loans that are guaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Agency MBS includes pass-through securities and CMO issued by GSEs and U.S. government agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by the issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including benchmark TBA security pricing and yield curves that were estimated based on U.S. Treasury yields and certain floating rate indices. The pricing matrices for these securities may also give consideration to pool-specific data supplied directly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using market-based pricing matrices that are based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above. 

&#160; 

States and political subdivisions: The Company&#8217;s investments in U.S. states and political subdivisions include obligations of county and municipal authorities and agency bonds, which are general obligations of the municipality or are supported by a specified revenue source. Holdings are geographically dispersed, with no significant concentrations in any one state or municipality. Additionally, all municipal obligations are highly rated or are otherwise collateralized by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. These securities are valued using market-based pricing matrices that reference observable inputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer spreads, material event notices and benchmark yield curves. 

&#160; 

Non-agency MBS: Non-agency MBS includes purchased interests in third-party securitizations that have a high investment grade rating, and the pricing matrices for these securities are based on observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer quotes and market research reports, the characteristics of a specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above; as such, these securities are classified as level 2. Non-agency MBS includes investments in Re-REMIC trusts that primarily hold non-agency MBS, which are valued based on broker pricing models that use baseline securities yields and tranche-level yield adjustments to discount cash flows using market convention prepayment speed and default assumptions. These investments are classified as level 3. 

&#160; 

Other securities: These securities consist primarily of corporate bonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds are senior and subordinated debt obligations of domestic corporations. The Company acquires commercial paper that is generally short-term in nature and highly rated. These securities are valued based on a review of quoted market prices for similar assets as well as through the various other inputs discussed previously. 

LHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are originated to be sold to investors are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted for servicing, interest rate risk, and credit risk. The changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage LHFS. 

MSRs: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS valuation model to project cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios and then are discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, other observable market data. Commercial MSRs are valued using a cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows. The Company considers actual and expected loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors that are determined based on current market conditions. Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for additional discussion. 

&#160; 

Equity securities: Equity securities primarily consist of exchange-traded securities and are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 

Derivative assets and liabilities: The Company holds derivative instruments for both trading and risk management purposes. These include exchange-traded futures or option contracts, OTC swaps, options, forwards and interest rate lock commitments. The fair values of derivatives are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable assumptions for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity and credit. The fair values of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments and are categorized as Level 3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that are not expected to fund and include the value attributable to the net servicing fees. Funding rates are based on the Company&#8217;s historical data. The fair value attributable to servicing is based on discounted cash flows, and is impacted by prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually-specified servicing fees, servicing costs and underlying portfolio characteristics. 

Private equity investments: In many cases there are no observable market values for these investments and therefore management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating performance of the investee to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant judgment, and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated. 

Securities sold short: Securities sold short represent debt securities sold short that are entered into as a hedging strategy for the purposes of supporting institutional and retail client trading activities.

The non-agency MBS categorized as Level 3 represent ownership interests in various tranches of Re-REMIC trusts. These securities are valued at a discount, which is unobservable in the market, to the fair value of the underlying securities owned by the trusts. The Re-REMIC tranches do not have an active market and therefore are categorized as Level 3. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of Re-REMIC non-agency MBS represented a discount of 21.5 % to the fair value of the underlying securities owned by the Re-REMIC trusts. 

The majority of private equity investments are in SBIC qualified funds, which primarily focus on equity and subordinated debt investments in privately-held middle market companies. The majority of these VIE investments are not redeemable and distributions are received as the underlying assets of the funds liquidate. The timing of distributions, which are expected to occur on various dates on an approximately ratable basis through 2029, is uncertain and dependent on various events such as recapitalizations, refinance transactions and ownership changes among others. As of December 31, 2019, restrictions on the ability to sell the investments include, but are not limited to, consent of a majority member or general partner approval for transfer of ownership. These investments are spread over numerous privately-held middle market companies, and thus the sensitivity to a change in fair value for any single investment is limited. The significant unobservable inputs for these investments are EBITDA multiples that ranged from 6 x to 13 x, with a weighted average of 9 x, at December 31, 2019. 

Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for additional information on valuation techniques and inputs for MSRs.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

The following table provides information about certain assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The carrying values represent end of period values, which approximate the fair value measurements that occurred on the various measurement dates throughout the period. The valuation adjustments represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. These assets are considered to be Level 3 assets (excludes PCI).

At December 31, 2019, LHFS consisted primarily of residential mortgages and commercial loans that were valued using market prices and measured at the lower of cost or market. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the Company held $ 107 million in nonperforming LHFS at December 31, 2019. LHFS that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest were not material at December 31, 2019. Impaired loans are primarily collateral dependent and may be subject to liquidity adjustments. Foreclosed real estate is measured at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell and consists primarily of residential homes, commercial properties, and vacant lots. 

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 

For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, estimates of fair value are based on relevant market data and information about the instrument. Values obtained relate to one trading unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership, possible tax ramifications, estimated transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various instruments. 

An active market does not exist for certain financial instruments. Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on current economic conditions, currency and interest rate risk characteristics, loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. In addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates. Financial assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value are summarized below:

Credit Derivative Instruments 

As part of the Company&#8217;s corporate investment banking business, the Company enters into contracts that are, in form or substance, written guarantees; specifically, CDS, risk participations and TRS. The Company accounts for these contracts as derivatives. 

The Company has entered into TRS contracts on loans. The Company&#8217;s TRS business consists of matched trades, such that when the Company pays depreciation on one TRS, it receives the same amount on the matched TRS. To mitigate its credit risk, the Company typically receives initial margin from the counterparty upon entering into the TRS and variation margin if the fair value of the underlying reference assets deteriorates. 

Truist has entered into risk participation agreements to share the credit exposure with other financial institutions on client-related interest rate derivative contracts. Under these agreements, the Company has guaranteed payment to a dealer counterparty in the event the dealer experiences a loss on the derivative, such as an interest rate swap, due to a failure to pay by the client, on that derivative. The Company manages its payment risk on its risk participations by monitoring the creditworthiness of the underlying client through the normal credit review process that the Company would have performed had it entered into a derivative directly with the obligors. At December 31, 2019, the remaining terms on these risk participations ranged from less than one year to 10 years. The potential future exposure represents the Company&#8217;s maximum estimated exposure to written risk participations, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments based on scenario simulations and assuming 100% default by all obligors on the maximum value.

NOTE 21. Operating Segments 

&#160; 

Truist operates and measures business activity across three segments: Consumer Banking and Wealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Insurance Holdings, with functional activities included in Other, Treasury, and Corporate. The Company's business segment structure is based on the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management as well as the products and services provided or the type of client served. 

Effective at the close of the Merger, several business activities were realigned within the segments in order to better serve the Truist strategic vision. Grandbridge Real Estate Capital, LLC, BB&#38;T Commercial Corporate Banking and Equipment and Government Finance have moved from the heritage Financial Services and Commercial Finance segment to the new Corporate and Commercial Banking segment. Additionally, Sterling Capital, BB&#38;T Securities and Wealth and Retirement Services have moved from Financial Services and Commercial Finance to Wealth, which is now included in the broader Consumer Banking and Wealth segment. Refer to "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional information related to the Merger.

Additionally, OT&#38;C houses intercompany eliminations, including intersegment net referral fees and residual interest rate risk after segment allocations have taken place. 

Truist Financial Corporation 141 

Truist emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client service, sales effectiveness and relationship management along with an organizational focus on referring clients between businesses. The objective is to provide Truist&#8217;s entire suite of products to our clients with the end goal of providing our clients the best financial experience in the marketplace. To promote revenue growth, revenues of certain products and services are reflected in the results of the segment providing those products and services and are also allocated to CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB. These allocated revenues between segments are reflected as net referral fees in noninterest income and eliminated in OT&#38;C. 

The segment results are presented based on internal management methodologies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The performance of the segments is not comparable with Truist&#8217;s consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships between the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 

Because business segment results are presented based on management accounting practices, the transition to the consolidated results prepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain differences, which are reflected as residuals in OT&#38;C. Business segment reporting conventions include, but are not limited to, the items as detailed below. 

Segment net interest income reflects matched maturity funds transfer pricing, which ascribes credits or charges based on the economic value or cost created by assets and liabilities of each segment. Residual differences between these credits and charges are captured in OT&#38;C. 

Noninterest income includes federal and state tax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax equivalent basis, related primarily to certain community development investments. Corporate expense allocations, including overhead or functional expenses that are not directly charged to the segments, are allocated to segments based on various drivers (number of equivalent employees, number of accounts, square footage assigned, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for these allocations are reported in OT&#38;C. 

Provision for credit losses represents net charge-offs by segment combined with an allocation to the segments for the provision attributable to each segment&#8217;s quarterly change in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes is calculated using a blended income tax rate for each segment and includes reversals of the noninterest income tax adjustments described above. The difference between the calculated provision for income taxes at the segment level and the consolidated provision for income taxes is reported in OT&#38;C. 

The application and development of management reporting methodologies is an active process and undergoes periodic enhancements. The implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the results disclosed for each segment, with no impact on consolidated results. If significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is revised, when practicable.

The transfer of funds in the form of dividends, loans or advances from bank subsidiaries to the Parent Company is restricted. Federal law requires loans to the Parent Company or its affiliates to be secured and at market terms and generally limits loans to the Parent Company or an individual affiliate to 10% of Truist Bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. In the aggregate, loans to the Parent Company and all affiliates cannot exceed 20% of the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. 

&#160; 

Dividend payments to the Parent Company by Truist Bank are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends from Truist Bank to the Parent Company are limited by rules which compare dividends to net income for regulatory-defined periods. Furthermore, dividends are restricted by regulatory minimum capital constraints.
