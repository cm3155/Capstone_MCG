 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

123 Fifth Third Bancorp 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221;) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bancorp as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Bancorp&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Bancorp&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bancorp has changed its method of accounting for financial assets measured at amortized cost in 2020 due to adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorp&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Bancorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (&#8220;ALLL&#8221;) &#8212; Qualitative Factors &#8212; Commercial Loans&#8212;Refer to Note 1 and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. 

For loans that are not individually evaluated, the Bancorp develops its estimate of expected credit losses using quantitative models, subject to certain qualitative adjustments. The expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions to the extent such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

124 Fifth Third Bancorp 

Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative models. 

At December 31, 2021, the key qualitative factors included adjustments associated with the current economic environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. These qualitative factors primarily address the incremental loss exposures relating to commercial borrowers in certain industries which have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or are otherwise experiencing prolonged distress. 

The ALLL for the commercial portfolio segment was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, which includes adjustments for the qualitative factors noted above. 

Considering the estimation and judgment in determining adjustments for such qualitative factors, our audit of the ALLL and the related disclosures involved subjective judgment about the qualitative adjustments to the commercial portfolio segment ALLL. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the qualitative adjustments for the commercial portfolio segment ALLL included the following, among others: 

&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of the Bancorp&#8217;s controls over the qualitative adjustments to the ALLL. 

&#8226; We assessed the reasonableness of, and evaluated support for, key qualitative adjustments based on market conditions, external market data and commercial portfolio performance metrics. 

&#8226; We tested the completeness and accuracy and evaluated the relevance of the key data used as inputs to the direct impact qualitative adjustment estimation process, including: 

&#9702; Portfolio segment loan balances and other borrower-specific data 

&#9702; Relevant macroeconomic indicators and data 

&#8226; With the assistance of our credit specialists, we evaluated the methodology and tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying support used as a basis for the qualitative adjustments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies 

Nature of Operations 

Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio corporation, conducts its principal lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service advisory activities through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries from banking centers located throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States as well as through other offices, telephone sales, the internet and mobile applications. 

Basis of Presentation 

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in which the Bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. Other entities, including certain joint ventures, in which the Bancorp has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, but upon which the Bancorp does not possess control, are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and not consolidated. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at fair value unless the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value. The Bancorp accounts for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative to fair value, representing the cost of the investment minus any impairment recorded, if any, and plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated entities have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Updates to Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies 

In conjunction with the prospective adoption of ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2020, the Bancorp updated its accounting and reporting policies for investment securities, portfolio loans and leases, the ALLL, the reserve for unfunded commitments and goodwill. The accounting and reporting policies for these sections for periods prior to January 1, 2020 are provided in the Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies Applicable Prior to January 1, 2020 section below. Further, for loans and leases that were part of the Bancorp&#8217;s COVID-19 customer relief programs, the Bancorp has elected certain accounting relief provisions that were provided by the FASB and/or various national banking regulatory agencies. Refer to the Regulatory Developments Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic section for additional information. 

Cash and Due from Banks 

Cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items in the process of collection and due from banks. Currency and coin includes both U.S. and foreign currency owned and held at Fifth Third offices and that is in-transit to the FRB. Cash items in the process of collection include checks and drafts that are drawn on another depository institution or the FRB that are payable immediately upon presentation in the U.S. Balances due from banks include noninterest-bearing balances that are funds on deposit at other depository institutions or the FRB. 

Investment Securities 

Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading on the date of purchase. Only those securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading 

debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in OCI. For available-for-sale debt securities hedged in a fair value hedge, the amortized cost basis of the hedged items (excluding unrealized gains and losses) includes the cumulative fair value hedging basis adjustments. Changes in the fair value of these securities which are attributable to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in earnings instead of OCI. Accrued interest receivable on investment securities is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of other assets. 

Available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly to determine if the decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss or other factors. An allowance for credit losses is recorded against available-for-sale securities to reflect the amount of the unrealized loss attributable to credit; however, this impairment is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any remaining unrealized loss is recognized through OCI. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recognized in earnings. 

The determination of whether or not a credit loss exists is based on consideration of the cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security. The Bancorp develops these expectations after considering various factors such as agency ratings, the financial condition of the issuer or underlying obligors, payment history, payment structure of the security, industry and market conditions, underlying collateral and other factors which may be relevant based on the facts and circumstances pertaining to individual securities. 

132 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

If the Bancorp intends to sell the debt security or will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the allowance for credit losses, if previously recorded, is written off and the security&#8217;s amortized cost is written down to the security&#8217;s fair value at the reporting date, with any incremental impairment recorded as a charge to noninterest income. 

Held-to-maturity debt securities are assessed periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary to absorb credit losses expected to occur over the remaining contractual life of the securities. The carrying amount of held-to-maturity debt securities is presented net of the valuation allowance for credit losses when such an allowance is deemed necessary. 

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values not accounted for under the equity method are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes as a result of an observable price change for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. At each quarterly reporting period, the Bancorp performs a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether impairment indicators are present. If qualitative indicators are identified, the investment is measured at fair value with the impairment loss included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments. 

Premiums on purchased callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date if the call feature meets certain criteria. Otherwise, premiums are amortized to maturity similar to discounts on callable debt securities. 

Realized securities gains or losses are reported within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 

Portfolio Loans and Leases 

Basis of accounting 

Portfolio loans and leases are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred direct loan origination fees and costs and any direct principal charge-offs. Direct loan origination fees and costs are deferred and the net amount is amortized over the estimated life of the related loans as a yield adjustment. Interest income is recognized based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method. 

Loans and leases acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Purchased loans and finance leases (including both sales-type leases and direct financing leases) are evaluated for evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and recorded at their initial fair value. For loans and finance leases that do not exhibit evidence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination, the Bancorp does not carry over the acquired company&#8217;s ALLL, but upon acquisition will record an ALLL and provision for credit losses reflective of credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual life of the acquired loans. Premiums and discounts reflected in the initial fair value are amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. 

For loans and finance leases that exhibit evidence of more-than-insignificant credit quality deterioration since origination, the Bancorp&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses is added to the ALLL upon acquisition and to the initial purchase price of the loans and leases to determine the initial amortized cost basis for the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. Any resulting difference between the initial amortized cost basis (as adjusted for expected credit losses) and the par value of the loans and leases at the acquisition date represents the non-credit premium or discount, which is amortized over the contractual life of the loan or lease as an adjustment to yield. This method of accounting for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality does not apply to loans carried at fair value or residential mortgage loans held for sale. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s lease portfolio consists of sales-type, direct financing and leveraged leases. Leases are classified as sales-type if the Bancorp transfers control of the underlying asset to the lessee. The Bancorp classifies leases that do not meet any of the criteria for a sales-type lease as a direct financing lease if the present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee and/or any other third party equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset and the collection of the lease payments and residual value guarantee is probable. Sales-type and direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on sales-type and direct financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment. 

Leveraged leases, entered into before January 1, 2019, are carried at the aggregate of lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease, net of the related deferred income tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive. Leveraged lease accounting is no longer applied for leases entered into or modified after the Bancorp&#8217;s adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases, on January 1, 2019. 

133 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Nonaccrual loans and leases 

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and amortization/accretion of deferred net direct loan origination fees or costs are discontinued and all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income. Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower&#8217;s cash flows may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due. Such loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past due 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. The Bancorp classifies residential mortgage loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 150 days as nonaccrual unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage loans may stay on nonaccrual status for an extended time as the foreclosure process typically lasts longer than 180 days. Home equity loans and lines of credit are reported on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Home equity loans and lines of credit that have been in default for 60 days or more are also reported on nonaccrual status if the senior lien has been in default 120 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as collateral-dependent TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status regardless of the borrower&#8217;s payment history or capacity to repay in the future. Residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other consumer loans that have been modified in a TDR and subsequently become past due 90 days are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial and credit card loans that have been modified in a TDR are classified as nonaccrual unless such loans have sustained repayment performance of six months or more and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the restructured terms. Well-secured loans are collateralized by perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for which the Bancorp estimates proceeds from the sale would be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of the loan and pay all costs to sell the collateral. The Bancorp considers a loan in the process of collection if collection efforts or legal action is proceeding and the Bancorp expects to collect funds sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest balance. 

Nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans are generally accounted for on the cost recovery method. The Bancorp believes the cost recovery method is appropriate for nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans because the assessment of collectability of the remaining amortized cost basis of these loans involves a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the nature or absence of underlying collateral. Under the cost recovery method, any payments received are applied to reduce principal. Once the entire recorded investment is collected, additional payments received are treated as recoveries of amounts previously charged-off until recovered in full, and any subsequent payments are treated as interest income. Nonaccrual residential mortgage loans and other nonaccrual consumer loans are generally accounted for on the cash basis method. The Bancorp believes the cash basis method is appropriate for nonaccrual residential mortgage and other nonaccrual consumer loans because such loans have generally been written down to estimated collateral values and the collectability of the remaining investment involves only an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral, which can be measured more objectively with a lesser degree of uncertainty than assessments of typical commercial loan collateral. Under the cash basis method, interest income is recognized when cash is received, to the extent such income would have been accrued on the loan&#8217;s remaining balance at the contractual rate. Nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the loan agreement and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. 

Commercial loans on nonaccrual status, including those modified in a TDR, as well as criticized commercial loans with aggregate borrower relationships exceeding $ 1 million, are subject to an individual review to identify charge-offs. The Bancorp does not have an established delinquency threshold for partially or fully charging off commercial loans. Residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and credit card loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 180 days are assessed for a charge-off to the ALLL, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Home equity loans and lines of credit are also assessed for charge-off to the ALLL when such loans or lines of credit have become past due 120 days if the senior lien is also 120 days past due, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Automobile and other consumer loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 120 days are assessed for a charge-off to the ALLL, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. 

Restructured loans and leases 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. 

Upon modification of a loan, the Bancorp measures the expected credit loss as either the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the fair value of collateral less cost to sell or the difference between the estimated future cash flows expected to be collected on the modified loan, discounted at the original effective yield of the loan, and the carrying value of the loan. Except for loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that are not reaffirmed by the borrower, residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as collateral-dependent TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status regardless of the 

134 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

borrower&#8217;s payment history or capacity to repay in the future. These loans are returned to accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of twelve months after bankruptcy and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual payments. 

Commercial loans and credit card loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or more prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or more in accordance with their modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained. In certain cases, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status may be accounted for using the cash basis method for income recognition, provided that full repayment of principal under the modified terms of the loan is reasonably assured. 

Residential mortgage loans that were restructured after receiving a forbearance related to the COVID-19 pandemic but that were not classified as a TDR as a result of the CARES Act are placed on nonaccrual status if they subsequently become past due 90 days unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection, consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s treatment of residential mortgage loan TDRs which subsequently become past due. Refer to the Regulatory Developments Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic section for additional information. 

Loans and Leases Held for Sale 

Loans and leases held for sale primarily represent conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell in the secondary market and jumbo residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, other residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans that management has the intent to sell. Loans and leases held for sale may be carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or carried at fair value where the Bancorp has elected the fair value option of accounting under U.S. GAAP. The Bancorp has elected to measure certain groups of loans held for sale under the fair value option, including certain residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale and certain purchased commercial loans designated as held for sale at acquisition. For loans in which the Bancorp has not elected the fair value option, the lower of cost or fair value is determined at the individual loan level. 

The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition includes the effects of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the ARM margin. These fair value marks are recorded as a component of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For residential mortgage loans that it has originated as held for sale, the Bancorp generally has commitments to sell these loans in the secondary market. Gains or losses on sales are recognized in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Management&#8217;s intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and, thereafter, reported within the Bancorp&#8217;s residential mortgage class of portfolio loans and leases. In such cases, if the fair value election was made, the residential mortgage loans will continue to be measured at fair value, which is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component. 

Loans and leases held for sale are placed on nonaccrual status consistent with the Bancorp&#8217;s nonaccrual policy for portfolio loans and leases. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

OREO, which is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and branch-related real estate no longer intended to be used for banking purposes. OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. All OREO property is periodically evaluated for impairment and decreases in carrying value are recognized as reductions in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For government-guaranteed mortgage loans, upon foreclosure, a separate other receivable is recognized if certain conditions are met for the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. This receivable is also included in other assets, separate from OREO, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

ALLL 

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is also considered a class. Classes within the consumer portfolio segment include home equity, indirect secured consumer, credit card and other consumer loans. For an analysis of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6. 

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for expected extensions, 

135 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

renewals or modifications except in circumstances where the Bancorp reasonably expects to execute a TDR with the borrower or where certain extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the Bancorp. 

Accrued interest receivable on loans is presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. The Bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the Bancorp has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable. Refer to the Portfolio Loans and Leases section for additional information. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ALLL to the Bancorp&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. 

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $ 1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated for an ALLL. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when determining the amount of ALLL. Other factors may include the borrower&#8217;s susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp&#8217;s evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. When loans and leases are individually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateral-dependent are measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases, including TDRs, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

Consumer and residential mortgage loans that have been modified in a TDR are individually evaluated for an ALLL. Allowances for individually evaluated loans that are collateral-dependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Individually evaluated loans that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate and a modeled expected credit loss amount. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Specific allowances on individually evaluated consumer and residential mortgage loans are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans and leases that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and, for loans with available credit, expected utilization rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics (such as internal credit risk grades, external credit ratings or scores, delinquency status, loan-to-value trends, etc.) over time, with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The Bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. This reversion is phased in over a two-year period. The Bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments 

136 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers, and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Loan Sales and Securitizations 

The Bancorp periodically sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies. The sold loans are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the time of sale. The Bancorp typically isolates the loans through the use of a VIE and thus is required to assess whether the entity holding the sold or securitized loans is a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidator of that VIE. If the Bancorp holds the power to direct activities most significant to the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then the Bancorp will generally be deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If the Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate. Refer to Note 12 for further information on consolidated and non-consolidated VIEs. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s loan sales and securitizations are generally structured with servicing retained, which often results in the recording of servicing rights. The Bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. The Bancorp has elected to measure all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio at fair value with changes in the fair value of servicing rights reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the changes occur. 

Servicing rights are valued using internal OAS models. Key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. In order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of the key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. 

Fees received for servicing loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as loan payments are received. Costs of servicing loans are charged to expense as incurred. 

Reserve for Representation and Warranty Provisions 

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. A contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. The Bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase reserve related to various representations and warranties that reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses based on a combination of factors. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s estimation process requires management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, such as future demand expectations, economic factors and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase. Such factors incorporate historical investor audit and repurchase demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss severity and any additional information obtained from the GSEs regarding future mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. At the time of a loan sale, the Bancorp records a representation and warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the loan as losses in excess of the reserve become probable and reasonably estimable. The provision for the estimated fair value of the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is 

137 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

included in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income at the time of sale. Updates to the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Legal Contingencies 

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp&#8217;s estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp&#8217;s defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. This accrual is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is adjusted from time to time as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. Legal expenses are recorded in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Bank Premises and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets 

Bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and operating lease equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lives of the related leases or useful lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. Whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate, the Bancorp tests its long-lived assets for impairment by determining whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a long-lived asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group through a probability-weighted approach. In the event the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred. Lease payments received for operating lease equipment are recognized in leasing business revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the lease term on a straight-line basis unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which benefit is expected to be derived from use of the underlying equipment. 

Lessee Accounting 

ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized for all leases unless the initial term of the lease is twelve months or less. Lease costs for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern of consumption. The lease term includes any renewal period that the Bancorp is reasonably certain to exercise. The Bancorp uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Variable lease payments associated with operating leases are recognized in the period in which the obligation for payments is incurred. 

For finance leases, the lease liability is measured using the effective interest method such that the liability is increased for interest based on the discount rate that is implicit in the lease or the Bancorp&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate if the implicit rate cannot be readily determined, offset by a decrease in the liability resulting from the periodic lease payments. The ROU asset associated with the finance lease is amortized on a straight-line basis unless there is another systematic and rational basis that better reflects how the benefits of the underlying assets are consumed over the lease term. The period over which the ROU asset is amortized is generally the lesser of the remaining lease term or the remaining useful life of the leased asset. Variable lease payments associated with finance leases are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 

When the lease liability is remeasured to reflect changes to the lease payments as a result of a lease modification, the ROU asset is adjusted for the amount of the lease liability remeasurement. If a lease modification reduces the scope of a lease, the ROU asset would be reduced proportionately based on the change in the lease liability and the difference between the lease liability adjustment and the resulting ROU asset adjustment would be recognized as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the amortization of the ROU asset is adjusted prospectively from the date of remeasurement. 

The Bancorp performs impairment assessments for ROU assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Any impairment loss is recognized in net occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to the Bank Premises and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets section of this note for further information. 

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting 

The Bancorp accounts for its derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value through adjustments to AOCI and/or current earnings, as appropriate. On the date the Bancorp enters into a derivative contract, the Bancorp designates the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or as a free-standing derivative instrument. For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period net income. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net income. For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period net income. 

138 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

When entering into a hedge transaction, the Bancorp formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction before the end of the quarter in which the transaction is consummated. This process includes linking the derivative instrument designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge to a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and the risk being hedged, along with a formal assessment at the inception of the hedge as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. The Bancorp continues to assess hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment (regression analysis). Additionally, the Bancorp may also utilize the shortcut method to evaluate hedge effectiveness for certain qualifying hedges with matched terms that permit the assumption of perfect offset. If the shortcut method is no longer appropriate, the Bancorp would apply the long-haul method identified at inception of the hedging transaction for assessing hedge effectiveness as long as the hedge is highly effective. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges, if hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative basis adjustments related to the hedged asset or liability are amortized to earnings in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of that asset of liability. For cash flow hedges, upon discontinuation of hedge accounting, any amounts in AOCI related to that relationship should affect earnings at the same time and in the same manner in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. However, if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts in AOCI are reclassified to earnings immediately. 

Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects 

The Bancorp invests in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize business and residential areas and preserve historic landmarks. These investments are classified as other assets on the Bancorp&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for LIHTC are accounted for using the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the tax credits and other benefits received and recognized as a component of applicable income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments which do not meet the qualification criteria for the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method of accounting with impairment associated with the investments recognized in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Income Taxes 

The Bancorp accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the federal and state tax rates to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. The net balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in other assets and accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any effect of a change in federal or state tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Bancorp reflects the expected amount of income tax to be paid or refunded during the year as current income tax expense or benefit. Accrued taxes represent the net expected amount due to and/or from taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp uses the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset. 

The Bancorp evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets based on all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date. Realization of deferred tax assets is based on the Bancorp&#8217;s judgment about relevant factors affecting their realization, including the taxable income within any applicable carry back periods, future projected taxable income, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Bancorp records a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where the Bancorp does not believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. 

Income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if the Bancorp believes that it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be sustained based solely on the technical merits of the tax position and consideration of the relevant taxing authority&#8217;s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. If the Bancorp does not believe that it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the Bancorp records a liability for the uncertain tax position. If the Bancorp believes that it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the Bancorp only records a tax benefit for the portion of the uncertain tax position where the likelihood of realization is greater than 50% upon settlement with the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Bancorp recognizes interest expense, interest income and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within applicable income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 21 for further discussion regarding income taxes. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Earnings per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, adjusted for the impact of potentially dilutive common shares arising from the exercise or settlement of stock-based awards and the settlement of outstanding forward contracts. 

139 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Bancorp calculates earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share separately for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For purposes of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, restricted shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities until vested. While the dividends declared per share on such restricted shares are the same as dividends declared per common share outstanding, the dividends recognized on such restricted shares may be less because dividends paid on restricted shares that are expected to be forfeited are reclassified to compensation expense during the period when forfeiture is expected. 

Goodwill 

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the recognition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events 

or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. 

Impairment exists when a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A recognized impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers. 

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The determination of the fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units includes both an income-based approach and a market-based approach. The income-based approach utilizes the reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. Refer to Note 10 for further information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s goodwill. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument&#8217;s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: 

Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Bancorp has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 &#8211; Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

140 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Level 3 &#8211; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Bancorp&#8217;s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Bancorp&#8217;s own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and DCF methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The Bancorp may, as a practical expedient, measure the fair value of certain investments on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment, or its equivalent. Any investments which are valued using this practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 28 for further information on fair value measurements. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Bancorp recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards that are expected to vest over the requisite service period. All awards, both those with cliff vesting and graded vesting, are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards to employees that meet eligible retirement status are expensed immediately. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time awards are exercised, cancelled, expire or restrictions are released, the Bancorp recognizes an adjustment to income tax expense for the difference between the previously estimated tax deduction and the actual tax deduction realized. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s stock-based compensation plans, refer to Note 25. 

Pension Plans 

The Bancorp uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flow during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension plan assets. Amortization of the net gain or loss resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. If, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10 % of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The Bancorp uses a third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of participating employees. This period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement mortality and other applicable employee demographics. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Bancorp&#8217;s interest income is derived from loans and leases, securities and other short-term investments. The Bancorp recognizes interest income in accordance with the applicable guidance in U.S. GAAP for these assets. Refer to the Portfolio Loans and Leases and Investment Securities sections of this footnote for further information. 

The Bancorp generally measures noninterest income revenue based on the amount of consideration the Bancorp expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to a customer, then recognizes this revenue when or as the Bancorp satisfies its performance obligations under the contract, except in transactions where U.S. GAAP provides other applicable guidance. When the amount of consideration is variable, the Bancorp will only recognize revenue to the extent that it is probable that the cumulative amount recognized will not be subject to a significant reversal in the future. Substantially all of the Bancorp&#8217;s contracts with customers have expected durations of one year or less and payments are typically due when or as the services are rendered or shortly thereafter. When third parties are involved in providing goods or services to customers, the Bancorp recognizes revenue on a gross basis when it has control over those goods or services prior to transfer to the customer; otherwise, revenue is recognized for the net amount of any fee or commission. The Bancorp excludes sales taxes from the recognition of revenue and recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense if the period of amortization for those costs would be one year or less. The following provides additional information about the components of noninterest income: 

&#8226; Commercial banking revenue consists primarily of service fees and other income related to loans to commercial clients, underwriting revenue recognized by the Bancorp&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiary and fees for other services provided to commercial clients. Revenue related to loans is recognized in accordance with the Bancorp&#8217;s policies for portfolio loans and leases. Underwriting revenue is generally recognized on the trade date, which is when the Bancorp&#8217;s performance obligations are satisfied. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposits consist primarily of treasury management fees for commercial clients, monthly service charges on consumer deposit accounts, transaction-based fees (such as overdraft fees and wire transfer fees), and other deposit account-related charges. The Bancorp&#8217;s performance obligations for treasury management fees and consumer deposit account service charges are typically satisfied over time while performance obligations for transaction-based fees are typically satisfied at a point in time. Revenues are recognized on an accrual basis when or as the services are provided to the customer, net of applicable discounts, waivers and reversals. Payments are typically collected from customers directly from the related deposit account at the time the transaction is processed and/or at the end of the customer&#8217;s statement cycle (typically monthly). 

&#8226; Wealth and asset management revenue consists primarily of service fees for investment management, custody, and trust administration services provided to commercial and consumer clients. The Bancorp&#8217;s performance obligations for these services are 

141 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

generally satisfied over time and revenues are recognized monthly based on the fee structure outlined in individual contracts. Transaction prices are most commonly based on the market value of assets under management or care and/or a fee per transaction processed. The Bancorp also offers certain services for which the performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized at a point in time, when the services are performed. Wealth and asset management revenue also includes trailing commissions received from investments and annuities held in customer accounts, which are recognized in revenue when the Bancorp determines that it has satisfied its performance obligations and has sufficient information to estimate the amount of the commissions to which it expects to be entitled. 

&#8226; Card and processing revenue consists primarily of ATM fees and interchange fees earned when the Bancorp&#8217;s credit and debit cards are processed through card association networks. The Bancorp&#8217;s performance obligations are generally complete when the transactions generating the fees are processed. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis as such services are performed, net of certain costs not controlled by the Bancorp (primarily interchange fees charged by credit card associations and expenses of certain transaction-based rewards programs offered to customers). 

&#8226; Leasing business revenue consists primarily of operating lease income, leasing business solutions revenue, lease remarketing fees and lease syndication fees from lease arrangements to commercial clients. Revenue related to leases is recognized either in accordance with the Bancorp&#8217;s policies for portfolio loans and leases or when the Bancorp&#8217;s performance obligations are satisfied. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking net revenue consists primarily of origination fees and gains on loan sales, mortgage servicing fees and the impact of MSRs. Refer to the Loans and Leases Held for Sale and Loan Sales and Securitizations sections of this footnote for further information. 

&#8226; Other noninterest income includes certain fees derived from loans, BOLI income, gains and losses on other assets, and other miscellaneous revenues and gains. 

Other 

Securities and other property held by Fifth Third Wealth and Asset Management, a division of the Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary, in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. 

Other short-term investments have original maturities less than one year and primarily include interest-bearing balances that are funds on deposit at other depository institutions or the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management activities. 

The Bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. The Bancorp invests in these policies, known as BOLI, to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefits costs. Certain BOLI policies have a stable value agreement through either a large, well-rated bank or multi-national insurance carrier that provides limited cash surrender value protection from declines in the value of each policy&#8217;s underlying investments. The Bancorp records these BOLI policies within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at each policy&#8217;s respective cash surrender value, with changes recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives and, based on the type of intangible asset, the amortization expense may be recorded in either leasing business revenue or other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bancorp reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 

Securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and included in other short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. 

Acquisitions of treasury stock are carried at cost. Reissuance of shares in treasury for acquisitions, exercises of stock-based awards or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific identification method. 

Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred. 

Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies Applicable Prior to January 1, 2020 

The following paragraphs describe the portions of the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting and reporting policies that were applicable prior to January 1, 2020 but were updated in conjunction with the prospective adoption of ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2020. The following paragraphs do not include the portions of the respective policies that were not affected by the adoption of these new accounting standards. 

Investment securities 

Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities with unrealized losses were reviewed quarterly for possible OTTI. If the Bancorp intended to sell the debt security or would more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, then an OTTI was deemed to have occurred. However, even if the Bancorp did not intend to sell the debt security and would not likely be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, the Bancorp evaluated expected cash flows to be received to determine if a credit loss had occurred. In the event of a credit loss, the credit component of the impairment was recognized within noninterest income and the non-credit component was recognized through OCI. 

142 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Portfolio loans and leases &#8211; basis of accounting 

Loans acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business combination were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Bancorp did not carry over the acquired company&#8217;s ALLL, nor did the Bancorp add to its existing ALLL as part of purchase accounting. 

Purchased loans were evaluated for evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and recorded at their initial fair value. For loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, the fair value discount or premium was amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. For loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration, the Bancorp determined at the acquisition date the excess of the loan&#8217;s contractually required payments over all cash flows expected to be collected as an amount that should not be accreted into interest income (nonaccretable difference). The remaining amount representing the difference in the expected cash flows of acquired loans and the initial investment in the acquired loans was accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans (accretable yield). Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in expected cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date were recognized prospectively as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The present values of any decreases in expected cash flows resulting directly from a change in the contractual interest rate were recognized prospectively as a reduction of the accretable yield. The present values of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date as a result of credit deterioration were recognized by recording an ALLL or a direct charge-off. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required ALLL were similar to originated loans. This method of accounting for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality did not apply to loans carried at fair value, residential mortgage loans held for sale and loans under revolving credit agreements. 

Impaired loans and leases 

A loan was considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it was probable that the Bancorp would be unable to collect all amounts due (including both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans generally consisted of nonaccrual loans and leases, loans modified in a TDR and loans over $ 1 million that were currently on accrual status and not yet modified in a TDR, but for which the Bancorp had determined that it was probable that it would grant a payment concession in the near term due to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties. For loans modified in a TDR, the contractual terms of the loan agreement referred to the terms specified in the original loan agreement. A loan restructured in a TDR was no longer considered impaired in years after the restructuring if the restructuring agreement specified a rate equal to or greater than the rate the Bancorp was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk and the loan was not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. Refer to the following ALLL section for discussion regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for identifying impaired loans and determination of the need for a loss accrual. 

ALLL 

The Bancorp maintained the ALLL to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL was maintained at a level the Bancorp considered to be adequate and was based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses were charged and recoveries were credited to the ALLL. Provisions for loan and lease losses were based on the Bancorp&#8217;s review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, deserved consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL required significant management judgment and was based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans and leases, TDRs and historical loss rates were reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance was maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans and leases. 

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $ 1 million that exhibited probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that had been modified in a TDR, were subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considered the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan or lease structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan or lease was impaired. Other factors might include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp&#8217;s evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. When individual loans and leases were impaired, allowances were determined based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans and leases were measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluated the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. 

Historical credit loss rates were applied to commercial loans and leases that were not impaired or were impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $ 1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates were derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which tracked the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans and leases according to their 

143 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompassed ten categories, which were based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. 

Homogenous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments were not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring were used to assess credit risks and allowances were established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates were based on the trailing twelve-month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss rates were adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, were necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. The prescriptive loss rate factors included adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO score trends and product mix. 

The Bancorp also considered qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These included adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values, geographic concentrations, estimated loss emergence period and specific portfolio loans backed by enterprise valuations and private equity sponsors. The Bancorp considered home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor. 

Reserve for unfunded commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments was maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve was based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This process took into consideration the same risk elements that were analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments were included in provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Goodwill 

Impairment existed when a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permitted the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluated events and circumstances which might include, but were not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Bancorp determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test would be unnecessary. However, if the Bancorp concluded otherwise or elected to bypass the qualitative assessment, it would then be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill impairment test, and continue to the second step (Step 2), if necessary. Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test compared the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test was necessary to measure the amount of impairment loss, which was equal to any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value with such loss limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. 

The fair value of a reporting unit was the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units were publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations could not be directly correlated to the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Bancorp employed an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Additionally, the Bancorp determined its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compared this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. 

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS 

Standards Adopted in 2021 

The Bancorp adopted the following new accounting standard effective January 1, 2021: 

ASU 2019-12 &#8211; Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also clarify and amend existing guidance for other areas of Topic 740. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2021 on a modified retrospective basis, except for certain provisions of the amended guidance which were required to be adopted prospectively. The adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reference Rate Reform and LIBOR Transition 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in the ASU apply only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued 

144 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, in January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, which clarified that the optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting also apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022 for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Bancorp as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Bancorp is in the process of evaluating and applying, as applicable, the optional expedients and exceptions in accounting for eligible contract modifications, eligible existing hedging relationships and new hedging relationships available through December 31, 2022. 

Significant Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted 

The following significant accounting standards were issued but not yet adopted by the Bancorp as of December 31, 2021: 

ASU 2020-06 &#8211; Debt -Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging &#8211; Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Equity&#8217;s Own Equity 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity&#8217;s own equity. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ASU 2021-08 &#8211; Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, which provided guidance on the accounting for revenue contracts with customers which are acquired in a business combination. The amendments generally state that an acquirer accounts for an acquired revenue contract with a customer as if it had originated the contract. The amendments also provide certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and liabilities. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the adoption date. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption if early adopted in an interim period. 

Regulatory Developments Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

On March 22, 2020, various national banking regulatory agencies jointly issued an interagency statement addressing loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement described the agencies&#8217; interpretation of how existing guidance in U.S. GAAP applied to certain loan modifications related to COVID-19. Among other things, the statement affirmed that short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were less than 30 days past due on contractual payments at the time a modification program was implemented would not be considered TDRs. The statement also clarified that loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should be evaluated on the basis of their modified terms when reporting loans as past due and evaluating for nonaccrual status and charge-off. 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act provided financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time in certain circumstances. This temporary suspension could only be applied to modifications of loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and could not be applied to modifications that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If elected, the temporary suspension could be applied to eligible modifications executed during the period beginning on March 1, 2020 and ending on the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the termination of the COVID-19 national emergency. The December 31, 2020 expiration date was subsequently extended to January 1, 2022 upon passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. On April 7, 2020, the national banking regulatory agencies revised their previously issued interagency statement to clarify the interactions with the provisions of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. 

The Bancorp elected to apply the temporary suspension of TDR requirements provided by the CARES Act for eligible loan modifications. For loan modifications that were not eligible for the suspension offered by the CARES Act or that were executed outside its applicable period, the Bancorp considered the interpretive guidance provided in the revised interagency statement to evaluate loan modifications within its scope, or existing TDR evaluation policies if the modification did not fall within the scope of the interagency statement. 

Loans and leases which received payment deferrals or forbearances as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s COVID-19 hardship relief programs were generally not reported as delinquent during the forbearance or deferral period if the loan or lease was less than 30 days past due at March 1, 2020 (the effective date of the COVID-19 national emergency declaration) unless the loan or lease subsequently becomes delinquent according to its modified terms. Those loans and leases that were 30 days or more past due at March 1, 2020 continued to be reported at their March 1, 2020 delinquency status unless the borrower made supplemental payments to resolve the delinquency. After the conclusion of the payment deferral or forbearance period, borrowers who were delinquent as of March 1, 2020 could be returned to current status once they demonstrated a willingness and ability to repay the loan according to its modified terms. This may be evidenced by payment history after the payment deferral or forbearance period, or by completing an evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness upon exit from the Bancorp&#8217;s hardship programs. Residential mortgage loans enrolled in a COVID-19 forbearance are generally not reported as more delinquent than the status as of the forbearance enrollment date so long as the borrower is in compliance with the terms of the forbearance. If a borrower fails to comply with the forbearance terms, then the delinquency status of the loan is remeasured based on the terms in the original loan contract. 

145 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For loans that received payment deferrals or forbearances as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s COVID-19 hardship relief programs, the Bancorp continued to accrue interest and recognize interest income during the period of the deferral. Depending on the terms of each program, all or a portion of this accrued interest may be paid directly by the borrower (either during the relief period, at the end of the relief period or at maturity of the loan) or added to the customer&#8217;s outstanding balance. For certain programs, the maturity date of the loan may also be extended by the number of payments deferred. Interest income continued to be recognized at the original contractual interest rate unless that rate is concurrently modified upon entering the relief program (in which case, the modified rate would be used to recognize interest). 

On April 10, 2020, the FASB staff issued a question-and-answer document (Q&#38;A) to address questions on the application of the lease accounting guidance for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Topic 842, subsequent changes to lease payments that are not stipulated in the original lease contract are generally accounted for as lease modifications. Some contracts may contain explicit or implicit enforceable rights and obligations that require lease concessions in certain circumstances and therefore would not be considered a lease modification. Given the significant cost and complexity in assessing the large volume of lease contracts for which concessions were being granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FASB clarified in this Q&#38;A that an entity could elect to account for lease concessions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as though enforceable rights and obligations for those concessions existed. This guidance eliminated the requirement to analyze each contract to determine whether enforceable rights and obligations to provide concessions existed and allowed an entity to elect to apply or not apply the lease modification guidance in Topic 842. This election was only available for concessions related to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic that did not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. 

The Bancorp elected to not apply the lease modification accounting guidance in Topic 842 for lease concessions granted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as the deferrals only affected the timing of the payments and the amount of consideration to be received was substantially the same as that required by the original contract. 

For commercial leases that received payment deferrals under the Bancorp&#8217;s COVID-19 hardship relief programs, the Bancorp continued to recognize interest income during the deferral period, but the yield was recalculated based on the timing and amount of remaining payments over the remaining lease term. The revised yield was used for prospectively recognizing interest income and adjusting the net investment in the lease. The Bancorp&#8217;s hardship relief programs for commercial leases affected the timing of payments but generally did not result in an increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. Therefore, the Bancorp elected to forego certain requirements that would typically apply for lease modifications when accounting for the effects of the hardship relief programs.

The Bancorp subsequently repurchased these loans and classified them as held for sale. 

3. Restrictions on Dividends and Capital Actions 

Restrictions on Cash Dividends 

The principal source of income and funds for the Bancorp (parent company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. The dividends paid by the Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary are subject to regulations and limitations prescribed by state and federal supervisory agencies. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary paid the Bancorp&#8217;s nonbank subsidiary holding company, which in turn paid the Bancorp $ 3.0 billion and $ 1.3 billion in dividends during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bancorp&#8217;s nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year. Additionally, as discussed below, during 2020 and 2021, the FRB took actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that limit the amount of cash dividends that the Bancorp may pay to its shareholders. 

Capital Actions 

The Bancorp is subject to restrictions on its capital actions, primarily as a result of supervisory policies set by the FRB. The Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan that governs its capacity to pay dividends and execute share repurchases and this plan is required to be submitted to the FRB periodically. 

In June 2020, the FRB took several actions in connection with its announcement of stress test results in light of the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, for the third quarter of 2020, the FRB required large banking organizations, including the Bancorp, to suspend share repurchases, cap dividend payments to the amount paid during the second quarter of 2020, and further limit dividends according to a formula based on recent income. These restrictions were extended, quarterly, with certain modifications, throughout the remainder of 2020. 

The FRB extended these restrictions into the first and second quarters of 2021, with certain modifications to permit a limited amount of share repurchases. During the first and second quarters of 2021, the Bancorp was authorized to pay dividends and execute share repurchases according to a formula based on recent income provided the Bancorp did not increase the amount of its common dividend. 

In June 2021, the FRB lifted the COVID-19 pandemic induced capital distribution limitations, which prohibited increases to the common dividend and placed limitations on share repurchases, and authorized the Bancorp, beginning July 1, 2021, to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the Board&#8217;s capital plan rule, inclusive of the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement. As a result, in the third quarter of 2021 the Bancorp increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $ 0.30 per share. Additionally, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021. For more information related to these transactions, refer to Note 24.

CREDIT RISK PROFILE 

Commercial Portfolio Segment 

For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leases. 

To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp utilizes the following categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. The five categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter. 

Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well-defined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter. 

The Bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or the Bancorp&#8217;s credit position. 

The Bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans and leases have well-defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. Loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected. 

The Bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans. 

Loans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible. Because loans and leases in this category are fully charged off, they are not included in the following tables. 

For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans.

Residential Mortgage and Consumer Portfolio Segments 

For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its consumer portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp&#8217;s residential mortgage portfolio segment is also a separate class. 

The Bancorp considers repayment performance as the best indicator of credit quality for residential mortgage and consumer loans, which includes both the delinquency status and performing versus nonperforming status of the loans. The delinquency status of all residential mortgage and consumer loans and the performing versus nonperforming status is presented in the following table. Loans and leases which received payment deferrals or forbearances as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s COVID-19 customer relief programs are generally not reported as delinquent during the forbearance or deferral period if the loan or lease was less than 30 days past due at March 1, 2020 (the effective date of the COVID-19 national emergency declaration) unless the loan or lease subsequently becomes delinquent according to its modified terms. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also particularly significant for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s process for developing these models and its process for estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period.

Collateral-Dependent Loans and Leases 

The Bancorp considers a loan or lease to be collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. When a loan or lease is collateral-dependent, its fair value is generally based on the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying collateral. 

The following table presents the amortized cost basis of the Bancorp&#8217;s collateral-dependent loans and leases, by portfolio class, as of:

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Within each of the Bancorp&#8217;s loan classes, TDRs typically involve either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loan&#8217;s maturity date with a stated rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loan&#8217;s accrued interest. Modifying the terms of a loan may result in an increase or decrease to the ALLL depending upon the terms modified, the method used to measure the ALLL for a loan prior to modification, the extent of collateral, and whether any charge-offs were recorded on the loan before or at the time of modification. Refer to the ALLL section of Note 1 for information on the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL methodology. Upon modification of a loan, the Bancorp measures the expected credit loss as either the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the fair value of collateral less cost to sell or the difference between the estimated future cash flows expected to be collected on the modified loan, discounted at the original effective yield of the loan, and the carrying value of the loan. The resulting measurement may result in the need for minimal or no allowance regardless of which is used because it is probable that all cash flows will be collected under the modified terms of the loan. In addition, if the stated interest rate was increased in a TDR that is not collateral-dependent, the cash flows on the modified loan, using the pre-modification interest rate as the discount rate, often exceed the amortized cost basis of the loan. Conversely, upon a modification that reduces the stated interest rate on a loan that is not collateral-dependent, the Bancorp recognizes an increase to the ALLL. If a TDR involves a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loan&#8217;s accrued interest, that amount is charged off to the ALLL. Loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are treated as nonaccrual collateral-dependent loans with a charge-off recognized to reduce the carrying values of such loans to the fair value of the related collateral less costs to sell. Certain loan modifications which were made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were not evaluated for classification as a TDR. Refer to the Regulatory Developments Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic section of Note 1 for additional information. 

The Bancorp had commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in a TDR, consisting of line of credit and letter of credit commitments of $ 121 million and $ 66 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 compared with $ 67 million and $ 72 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.

The Bancorp considers TDRs that become 90 days or more past due under the modified terms as subsequently defaulted. For commercial loans not subject to individual evaluation for an ALLL, the applicable commercial models are applied for purposes of determining the ALLL as well as qualitatively assessing whether those loans are reasonably expected to be further restructured prior to their maturity date and, if so, the impact such a restructuring would have on the remaining contractual life of the loans. When a residential mortgage, home equity, indirect secured consumer or other consumer loan that has been modified in a TDR subsequently defaults, the present value of expected cash flows used in the measurement of the expected credit loss is generally limited to the expected net proceeds from the sale of the loan&#8217;s underlying

The Bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience in its consumer distribution network. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining full-service banking centers at certain locations. Similarly, the Bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion. The Bancorp closed a total of 44 banking centers throughout its footprint during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.

10. Goodwill 

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically result in the recognition of goodwill. Acquisition activity includes acquisitions in the respective period in addition to purchase accounting adjustments related to previous acquisitions. 

The Bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2021 by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. In performing this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, macroeconomic conditions, banking industry and market conditions and key financial metrics of the Bancorp as well as reporting unit and overall Bancorp financial performance. After assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the Bancorp determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the Commercial Banking, Branch Banking and Wealth and Asset Management reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. 

Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting unit, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

11. Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, developed technology, customer relationships, operating leases, non-compete agreements, trade names and books of business. Intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives and, based on the type of intangible asset, the amortization may be recorded in either leasing business revenue or other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The increase in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects acquisition activity during the year, which included the recognition of $ 62 million in developed technology. This asset will be amortized over its remaining useful life, which was estimated to be 8 years at the time of acquisition.

12. Variable Interest Entities 

The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The Bancorp evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. If the Bancorp is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it must account for the VIE as a consolidated subsidiary. If the Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate. 

Consolidated VIEs 

The Bancorp has consolidated VIEs related to certain automobile loan securitizations where it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary. The following table provides a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for consolidated VIEs as of: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Assets: Other short-term investments $ 24 &#160; 55 &#160; Indirect secured consumer loans 322 &#160; 756 &#160; ALLL ( 2 ) ( 7 ) Other assets 2 &#160; 5 &#160; Total assets $ 346 &#160; 809 &#160; Liabilities: Other liabilities $ 1 &#160; 2 &#160; Long-term debt 263 &#160; 656 &#160; Total liabilities $ 264 &#160; 658 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

The Bancorp has previously completed securitization transactions in which the Bancorp transferred certain consumer automobile loans to bankruptcy remote trusts which were deemed to be VIEs. In each of these securitization transactions, the primary purposes of the VIEs were to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as well as residual interests, and to provide the Bancorp with access to liquidity for its originated loans. The Bancorp retained residual interests in the VIEs and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. In addition, the Bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. As a result, the Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and has consolidated these VIEs. The assets of the VIEs are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the VIEs. The third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp. 

The economic performance of the VIEs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The principal risks to which the VIEs are exposed include credit risk and prepayment risk. The credit and prepayment risks are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, overcollateralization, excess interest on the loans and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities to other classes. 

Non-consolidated VIEs 

The following tables provide a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to non-consolidated VIEs for which the Bancorp holds an interest, but is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s maximum exposure to losses associated with its interests in the entities as of:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

CDC investments 

CDC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Bancorp, was created to invest in projects to create affordable housing and revitalize business and residential areas. CDC generally co-invests with other unrelated companies and/or individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity that owns the property under development. The entities are usually formed as limited partnerships and LLCs and CDC typically invests as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity contributions. The economic performance of the VIEs is driven by the performance of their underlying investment projects as well as the VIEs&#8217; ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying project or the VIEs&#8217; ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs. For information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting for these investments, refer to Note 1. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and any additional unfunded commitments for future equity contributions. The Bancorp&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments, including the unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liabilities related to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. The Bancorp has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would expose the Bancorp to a loss. In certain arrangements, the general partner/managing member of the VIE has guaranteed a level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the Bancorp&#8217;s risk. 

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s CDC investments included $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.3 billion, respectively, of investments in affordable housing tax credits recognized in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unfunded commitments related to these investments were $ 573 million and $ 478 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2021 are expected to be funded from 2022 to 2039. 

The Bancorp has accounted for all of its qualifying LIHTC investments using the proportional amortization method of accounting. The following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income related to these investments for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START Consolidated Statements of Income Caption (a) 

2021 2020 2019 Proportional amortization Applicable income tax expense $ 163 &#160; 150 &#160; 140 &#160; Tax credits and other benefits Applicable income tax expense ( 193 ) ( 175 ) ( 163 ) ##TABLE_END

(a) The Bancorp did no t recognize impairment losses resulting from the forfeiture or ineligibility of tax credits or other circumstances during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 

Private equity investments 

The Bancorp invests as a limited partner in private equity investments which provide the Bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates of return on invested capital, while also providing strategic opportunities in certain cases. Each of the limited partnerships has an unrelated third-party general partner responsible for appointing the fund manager. The Bancorp has not been appointed fund manager for any of these private equity investments. The funds finance primarily all of their activities from the partners&#8217; capital contributions and investment returns. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not have the obligation to absorb the funds&#8217; expected losses or the right to receive the funds&#8217; expected residual returns that could potentially be significant to the funds and lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the funds. The Bancorp, as a limited partner, does not have substantive participating or substantive kick-out rights over the general partner. Therefore, the Bancorp accounts for its investments in these limited partnerships under the equity method of accounting. 

The Bancorp is exposed to losses arising from the negative performance of the underlying investments in the private equity investments. As a limited partner, the Bancorp&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are presented in previous tables. Also, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s unfunded commitment amounts to the private equity funds were $ 124 million and $ 83 million, respectively. As part of previous commitments, the Bancorp made capital contributions to private equity investments of $ 17 million and $ 19 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Loans provided to VIEs 

The Bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated VIEs sponsored by third parties. These VIEs are generally established to finance certain consumer and small business loans originated by third parties. The entities are primarily funded through the issuance of a loan from the Bancorp or a syndication through which the Bancorp is involved. The sponsor/administrator of the entities is responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the VIEs. Because the sponsor/administrator, not the Bancorp, holds the servicing responsibilities, which include the establishment and employment of default mitigation policies and procedures, the Bancorp does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary. 

170 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit risk related to the underlying assets. The Bancorp&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and unfunded commitments to the VIEs. The Bancorp&#8217;s outstanding loans to these VIEs are included in commercial loans in Note 5. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s unfunded commitments to these entities were $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively. The loans and unfunded commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp&#8217;s overall analysis of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments, respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these VIEs. 

Lease pool entities 

The Bancorp is a co-investor with other unrelated leasing companies in three LLCs designed for the purpose of purchasing pools of residual interests in leases which have been originated or purchased by the other investing member. For each LLC, the leasing company is the managing member and has full authority over the day-to-day operations of the entity. While the Bancorp holds more than 50 % of the equity interests in each LLC, the operating agreements require both members to consent to significant corporate actions, such as liquidating the entity or removing the manager. In addition, the Bancorp has a preference with regards to distributions such that all of the Bancorp&#8217;s equity contribution for each pool must be distributed, plus a pre-defined rate of return, before the other member may receive distributions. The leasing company is also entitled to the return of its investment plus a pre-defined rate of return before any residual profits are distributed to the members. 

The lease pool entities are primarily subject to risk of losses on the lease residuals purchased. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities. This power is held by the leasing company, who as managing member controls the servicing of the leases and collection of the proceeds on the residual interests.

13. Sales of Receivables and Servicing Rights 

Residential Mortgage Loan Sales 

The Bancorp sold fixed and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. In those sales, the Bancorp obtained servicing responsibilities and provided certain standard representations and warranties; however, the investors have no recourse to the Bancorp&#8217;s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Bancorp receives servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance. The Bancorp identifies classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest rates. 

Information related to residential mortgage loan sales and the Bancorp&#8217;s mortgage banking activity, which is included in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income, for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 2019

(a) Represents the unpaid principal balance at the time of the sale. 

Servicing Rights 

The Bancorp measures all of its servicing rights at fair value with changes in fair value reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table presents changes in the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Balance, beginning of period $ 656 &#160; 993 &#160; Servicing rights originated 223 &#160; 184 &#160; Servicing rights purchased 381 &#160; 44 &#160; Changes in fair value: Due to changes in inputs or assumptions (a)

( 281 ) ( 254 ) Balance, end of period $ 1,121 &#160; 656 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates. 

(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time. 

The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of the MSR portfolio. This strategy may include the purchase of free-standing derivatives and various available-for-sale debt and trading debt securities. The interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR portfolio caused by fluctuating OAS, earnings rates and prepayment speeds. The fair value of the servicing asset is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. 

The following table presents activity related to valuations of the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy for the years ended December 31:

The key economic assumptions used in measuring the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that continued to be held by the Bancorp at the date of sale, securitization, or purchase resulting from transactions completed during the years ended December 31 were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 Weighted- Average Life (in years) Prepayment Speed (annual) OAS (bps) Weighted-Average Life (in years) Prepayment Speed (annual) OAS (bps) Fixed-rate 6.5 10.7 &#160; % 693 5.9 12.1 &#160; % 727 Adjustable-rate 2.7 28.8 &#160; 626 3.8 18.3 &#160; 681 ##TABLE_END

172 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp serviced $ 89.2 billion and $ 68.8 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans for other investors. The value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Bancorp is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold financial assets. 

At December 31, 2021, the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10%, 20% and 50% adverse changes in prepayment speed assumptions and immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in OAS for servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans are as follows: 

##TABLE_START 

($ in millions) (a) 

Fair Value Weighted- Average Life (in years) Prepayment Speed Assumption OAS Assumption Impact of Adverse Change on Fair Value OAS (bps) Impact of Adverse Change on Fair Value Rate 10% 20% 50% 10% 20% Fixed-rate $ 1,116 &#160; 6.3 10.7 &#160; % $ ( 48 ) ( 93 ) ( 211 ) 686 $ ( 30 ) ( 58 ) Adjustable-rate 5 &#160; 4.1 20.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 2 ) 1087 &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END

(a) The impact of the weighted-average default rate on the current fair value of residual cash flows for all scenarios is immaterial. 

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on these variations in the assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. The Bancorp believes that variations of these levels are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential that adverse changes in key assumptions could be even greater. Also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interests that continue to be held by the Bancorp is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which might magnify or counteract these sensitivities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

14. Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. Additionally, the Bancorp holds derivative instruments for the benefit of its commercial customers and for other business purposes. The Bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative derivative positions. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the Bancorp&#8217;s net interest margin and cash flows. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated notional amount and maturity date. Interest rate floors protect against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates. Forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. Options provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an agreed upon price. Swaptions are financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a swap. 

Prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value of the largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. The Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBA securities and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment volatility. Principal-only swaps are total return swaps based on changes in the value of the underlying mortgage principal-only trust. TBA securities are a forward purchase agreement for a mortgage-backed securities trade whereby the terms of the security are undefined at the time the trade is made. 

Foreign currency volatility occurs as the Bancorp enters into certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate contracts) for the benefit of commercial customers and other business purposes. The Bancorp economically hedges significant exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable and independent counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Bancorp&#8217;s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. Credit risk is minimized through credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures. 

The fair value of derivative instruments is presented on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements. Derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value amounts with the exception of certain variation margin payments that are considered legal settlements of the derivative contracts. For derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlements, the variation margin payments are applied to net the fair value of the respective derivative contracts. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s derivative assets include certain contractual features in which the Bancorp requires the counterparties to provide collateral in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in the fair value of the derivatives, including changes in the fair value due to credit risk of the counterparty. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of collateral held by the Bancorp for derivative assets was $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively. For derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties whose rules treat variation margin payments as settlement of the derivative contract, the payments for variation margin of $ 771 million and $ 1.1 billion were applied to reduce the respective derivative contracts and were also not included in the total amount of collateral held as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The credit component negatively impacting the fair value of derivative assets associated with customer accommodation contracts was $ 20 million and $ 42 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

In measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities, the Bancorp considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration collateral maintenance requirements of certain derivative counterparties and the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require collateral maintenance. When necessary, the Bancorp posts collateral primarily in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in fair value of the derivatives, including changes in fair value due to the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of collateral posted by the Bancorp for derivative liabilities was $ 1.3 billion and $ 463 million, respectively. Additionally, $ 570 million and $ 1.1 billion of variation margin payments were applied to the respective derivative contracts to reduce the Bancorp&#8217;s derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were also not included in the total amount of collateral posted. Certain of the Bancorp&#8217;s derivative liabilities contain credit-risk related contingent features that could result in the requirement to post additional collateral upon the occurrence of specified events. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the additional collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk related contingent features being triggered was immaterial to the Bancorp&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. The posting of collateral has been determined to remove the need for further consideration of credit risk. As a result, the Bancorp determined that the impact of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk to the valuation of its derivative liabilities was immaterial to the Bancorp&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Hedges 

The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-rate funding to floating-rate or to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Decisions to enter into these interest rate swaps are made primarily through consideration of the asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. As of December 31, 2021, certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify for the shortcut method of accounting that permits the assumption of perfect offset. For all designated fair value hedges of interest rate risk as of December 31, 2021 that were not accounted for under the shortcut method of accounting, the Bancorp performed an assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis with changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk recorded in the same income statement line in current period net income. 

The following table reflects the changes in fair value of interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges and the changes in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, as well as the line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income in which the corresponding gains or losses are recorded:

Cash Flow Hedges 

The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The assets or liabilities may be grouped in circumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the Bancorp desires to hedge. The Bancorp may also enter into interest rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of floating rate assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, all hedges designated as cash flow hedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. The entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI and reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum length of time over which the Bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 37 months. 

Reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related to commercial and industrial loans are recorded within interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $ 353 million and $ 718 million, respectively, of net deferred gains, net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, $ 212 million in net unrealized gains, net of tax, recorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2021. 

During both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no gains or losses reclassified from AOCI into earnings associated with the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time as defined by U.S. GAAP. 

The following table presents the pre-tax net (losses) gains recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:

Free-Standing Derivative Instruments &#8211; Risk Management and Other Business Purposes 

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBA securities and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the spread between mortgage rates and LIBOR because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of tightening spreads. Principal-only swaps also provide prepayment protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, as opposed to MSRs that lose value in a faster prepayment environment. Receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as quickly as expected. 

The Bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. These contracts generally settle within one year or less. IRLCs issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that will be held for sale are also considered free-standing derivative instruments and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. Revaluation gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

In conjunction with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares in 2009, the Bancorp entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. This total return swap is accounted for as a free-standing derivative. Refer to Note 28 for further discussion of significant inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of this instrument. 

177 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Bancorp entered into certain interest rate swap contracts for the purpose of managing its collateral positions across two central clearing parties. These interest rate swaps were perfectly offsetting positions that allowed the Bancorp to lower the cash posted as required initial margin at the clearing parties, which reduced its credit exposure to the clearing parties. Given that all relevant terms for these interest rate swaps are offsetting, these trades create no additional market risk for the Bancorp. 

As part of the LIBOR to SOFR transition, the Bancorp received certain interest rate swap contracts from the two central clearing parties that are moving from an Effective Federal Funds Rate discounting curve to a SOFR discounting curve. The purpose of these interest rate swaps was to neutralize the impact on collateral requirements due to the change in discounting curves implemented by the central clearing parties. 

The net (losses) gains recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to free-standing derivative instruments used for risk management and other business purposes are summarized in the following table:

Free-Standing Derivative Instruments &#8211; Customer Accommodation 

The majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and commodity contracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The Bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of commercial banking revenue or other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under which the Bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain underlying interest rate derivative contracts. The Bancorp only enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which the Bancorp has participated in the loan that the underlying interest rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. The Bancorp will make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of the risk participation agreements was $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively, and the fair value was a liability of $ 8 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the risk participation agreements had a weighted-average remaining life of 3.8 years. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s maximum exposure in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate derivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk grading system currently utilized for establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease portfolio. 

Risk ratings of the notional amount of risk participation agreements under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of December 31:

Offsetting Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Bancorp&#8217;s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements and similar arrangements, which include provisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties. When the Bancorp has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the non-defaulting party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office. The Bancorp&#8217;s policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for setoff are in place. However, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlements, the fair value of the respective derivative contracts is reported net of the variation margin payments. 

Collateral amounts included in the tables below consist primarily of cash and highly rated government-backed securities and do not include variation margin payments for derivative contracts with legal rights of setoff for both periods shown. 

The following table provides a summary of offsetting derivative financial instruments:

In conjunction with Worldpay, Inc.&#8217;s IPO in 2012, the Bancorp entered into two TRAs with Worldpay, Inc. The TRAs provide for payments by Worldpay, Inc. to the Bancorp of 85 % of the cash savings actually realized as a result of the increase in tax basis that results from the historical or future purchase of equity in Worldpay Holding, LLC from the Bancorp or from the exchange of equity units in Worldpay Holding, LLC for cash or Class A Stock, as well as any tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Bancorp entered into an agreement with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and Worldpay, Inc. under which Worldpay, Inc. may be obligated to pay up to approximately $ 366 million to the Bancorp to terminate and settle a portion of the remaining TRA cash flows, totaling an estimated $ 720 million, upon the exercise of certain call options by Worldpay, Inc. or certain put options by the Bancorp. In 2019, the Bancorp recognized a gain of approximately $ 345 million in other noninterest income associated with these options. The Worldpay, Inc. TRA receivable associated with this transaction, recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $ 317 million and $ 321 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Separate from the impact of the TRA settlement agreement discussed above, the Bancorp recognized $ 46 million, $ 74 million and $ 1 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the TRA during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bancorp expects to receive approximately $ 78 million of future payments through 2025 under the TRA that are not subject to the call or put options. These remaining cash flows will be recognized in future periods when the related uncertainties are resolved .

16. Short-Term Borrowings 

Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Federal funds purchased are excess balances in reserve accounts held at the FRB that the Bancorp purchased from other member banks on an overnight basis. Other short-term borrowings may include securities sold under repurchase agreements, derivative collateral, FHLB advances and other borrowings with original maturities of one year or less.

The Bancorp&#8217;s securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and are collateralized by securities included in available-for-sale debt and other securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These securities are subject to changes in market value and, therefore, the Bancorp may increase or decrease the level of securities pledged as collateral based upon these movements in market value. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, all securities sold under repurchase agreements were secured by agency residential mortgage-backed securities and the repurchase agreements had an overnight remaining contractual maturity. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s other secured borrowings at December 31, 2020 primarily included obligations recognized by the Bancorp under ASC Topic 860 related to certain loans sold to GNMA and serviced by the Bancorp. Under ASC Topic 860, once the Bancorp has the unilateral right to repurchase the GNMA loans due to the borrower missing three consecutive payments, the Bancorp is considered to have regained effective control over the loan. As such, the Bancorp was required to recognize both the loan and the repurchase liability, regardless of the intent to repurchase the loans. The Bancorp repurchased these loans during 2021.

18. Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees 

The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, enters into financial instruments and various agreements to meet the financing needs of its customers. The Bancorp also enters into certain transactions and agreements to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks, provide funding, equipment and locations for its operations and invest in its communities. These instruments and agreements involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk, counterparty risk and market risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The creditworthiness of counterparties for all instruments and agreements is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Bancorp&#8217;s credit policies. The Bancorp&#8217;s significant commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discussed in the following sections. 

Commitments 

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts. The following table reflects a summary of significant commitments as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Commitments to extend credit $ 80,641 &#160; 74,499 &#160; Letters of credit 1,953 &#160; 1,982 &#160; Forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale 1,952 &#160; 2,903 &#160; Purchase obligations 160 &#160; 195 &#160; Capital commitments for private equity investments 124 &#160; 83 &#160; Capital expenditures 78 &#160; 75 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

Commitments to extend credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the contract. Fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the Bancorp&#8217;s exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp had a reserve for unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling $ 182 million and $ 172 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit using the same standard regulatory risk rating systems utilized for its loan and lease portfolio. 

Risk ratings of outstanding commitments to extend credit under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Pass $ 78,298 &#160; 71,386 &#160; Special mention 1,058 &#160; 2,049 &#160; Substandard 1,285 &#160; 1,063 &#160; Doubtful &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Total commitments to extend credit $ 80,641 &#160; 74,499 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Letters of credit 

Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and expire as summarized in the following table as of December 31, 2021: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 

Less than 1 year (a) 

$ 985 &#160; 

1 - 5 years (a) 

967 &#160; Over 5 years 1 &#160; Total letters of credit $ 1,953 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(a) Includes $ 2 and $ 3 issued on behalf of commercial customers to facilitate trade payments in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies which expire in less than 1 year and between 1 - 5 years, respectively. 

Standby letters of credit accounted for approximately 99 % of total letters of credit at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 and are considered guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Approximately 71 % and 68 % of the total standby letters of credit were collateralized as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the event of nonperformance by the customers, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. The reserve related to these standby letters of credit, which was included in the total reserve for unfunded commitments, was $ 24 million and $ 27 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with letters of credit using the same standard regulatory risk rating systems utilized for its loan and lease portfolio. 

186 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Risk ratings of outstanding letters of credit under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Pass $ 1,778 &#160; 1,739 &#160; Special mention 40 &#160; 111 &#160; Substandard 135 &#160; 132 &#160; Total letters of credit $ 1,953 &#160; 1,982 &#160; ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp had outstanding letters of credit that were supporting certain securities issued as VRDNs. The Bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by marketing the VRDNs to investors. The VRDNs pay interest to holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market demand. The VRDNs generally have long-term maturity dates, but can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper advance notice. When the VRDNs are tendered, a remarketing agent generally finds another investor to purchase the VRDNs to keep the securities outstanding in the market. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, total VRDNs, of which FTS was the remarketing agent for all, were $ 464 million and $ 385 million, respectively. As remarketing agent, FTS is responsible for actively remarketing VRDNs to other investors when they have been tendered. If another investor is not identified, FTS may choose to purchase the VRDNs into inventory at its discretion while it continues to remarket them. If FTS purchases the VRDNs into inventory, it can subsequently tender back the VRDNs to the issuer&#8217;s trustee with proper advance notice. The Bancorp issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to $ 118 million and $ 142 million of the VRDNs remarketed by FTS at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the previous tables. The Bancorp held $ 1 million and zero of these VRDNs in its portfolio and classified them as trading debt securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale 

The Bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. The outstanding notional amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of significant commitments table for all periods presented. 

Other commitments 

The Bancorp has entered into a limited number of agreements for work related to banking center construction and to purchase goods or services. 

Contingent Liabilities 

Legal claims 

There are legal claims pending against the Bancorp and its subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 19 for additional information regarding these proceedings. 

Guarantees 

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual arrangements as discussed in the following sections. 

Residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions 

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. A contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan, or indemnify or make whole the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. For more information on how the Bancorp establishes the residential mortgage repurchase reserve, refer to Note 1. 

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp maintained reserves related to loans sold with representation and warranty provisions totaling $ 9 million and $ 8 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Bancorp uses the best information available when estimating its mortgage representation and warranty reserve; however, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts reserved as of December 31, 2021 are reasonably possible. The Bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to mortgage representation and warranty provisions in an amount up to approximately $ 12 million in excess of amounts reserved. This estimate was derived by modifying the key assumptions to reflect management&#8217;s judgment regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. The actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this estimate of reasonably possible losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those previously discussed. 

During both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp paid an immaterial amount in the form of make-whole payments and repurchased $ 42 million and $ 25 million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. Total repurchase demand 

187 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

requests during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 64 million and $ 32 million, respectively. Total outstanding repurchase demand inventory was $ 18 million and $ 5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Margin accounts 

FTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances held by its brokerage clearing agent for the benefit of its customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. The margin account balances held by the brokerage clearing agent were $ 20 million and $ 14 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the event of customer default, FTS has rights to the underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the underlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the Bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin accounts. 

Long-term borrowing obligations 

The Bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities of $ 62 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Visa litigation 

The Bancorp, as a member bank of Visa prior to Visa&#8217;s reorganization and IPO (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;) of its Class A common shares (the &#8220;Class A Shares&#8221;) in 2008, had certain indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa&#8217;s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with its membership agreements. In accordance with Visa&#8217;s bylaws prior to the IPO, the Bancorp could have been required to indemnify Visa for the Bancorp&#8217;s proportional share of losses based on the pre-IPO membership interests. As part of its reorganization and IPO, the Bancorp&#8217;s indemnification obligation was modified to include only certain known or anticipated litigation (the &#8220;Covered Litigation&#8221;) as of the date of the restructuring. This modification triggered a requirement for the Bancorp to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the indemnification liability. 

In conjunction with the IPO, the Bancorp received 10.1 million of Visa&#8217;s Class B common shares (the &#8220;Class B Shares&#8221;) based on the Bancorp&#8217;s membership percentage in Visa prior to the IPO. The Class B Shares are not transferable (other than to another member bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the IPO closing or the date on which the Covered Litigation has been resolved; therefore, the Bancorp&#8217;s Class B Shares were classified in other assets and accounted for at their carryover basis of $ 0 . Visa deposited $ 3 billion of the proceeds from the IPO into a litigation escrow account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation. Since then, when Visa&#8217;s litigation committee determined that the escrow account was insufficient, Visa issued additional Class A Shares and deposited the proceeds from the sale of the Class A Shares into the litigation escrow account. When Visa funded the litigation escrow account, the Class B Shares were subjected to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of Class B Shares into Class A Shares. 

In 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. The swap terminates on the later of the third anniversary of Visa&#8217;s IPO or the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the valuation of the swap. The counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the Class B Shares will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares caused by any Covered Litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. If actual judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation significantly exceed current expectations, then additional funding by Visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the Class B Shares could result in a scenario where the Bancorp&#8217;s ultimate exposure associated with the Covered Litigation (the &#8220;Visa Litigation Exposure&#8221;) exceeds the value of the Class B Shares owned by the swap counterparty (the &#8220;Class B Value&#8221;). In the event the Bancorp concludes that it is probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure exceeds the Class B Value, the Bancorp would record a litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. Any such litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap. 

As of the date of the Bancorp&#8217;s sale of the Visa Class B Shares and through December 31, 2021, the Bancorp has concluded that it is not probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure will exceed the Class B value. Based on this determination, upon the sale of the Class B Shares, the Bancorp reversed its net Visa litigation reserve liability and recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the total return swap. The fair value of the swap liability was $ 214 million and $ 201 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 14 and Note 28 for further information. 

188 Fifth Third Bancorp

After the Bancorp&#8217;s sale of the Class B Shares, Visa has funded additional amounts into the litigation escrow account which have resulted in further dilutive adjustments to the conversion of Class B Shares into Class A Shares, and along with other terms of the total return swap, required the Bancorp to make cash payments in varying amounts to the swap counterparty as follows:

Litigation 

Visa/MasterCard Merchant Interchange Litigation 

In April 2006, the Bancorp was added as a defendant in a consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against Visa&#174;, MasterCard&#174; and several other major financial institutions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (In re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 5-MD-1720). The plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S. and trade associations, claimed that the interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks were unreasonable and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In addition to being a named defendant, the Bancorp is currently also subject to a possible indemnification obligation of Visa as discussed in Note 18 and has also entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa, MasterCard and certain other named defendants. In October 2012, the parties to the litigation entered into a settlement agreement that was initially approved by the trial court but reversed by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. Pursuant to the terms of the overturned settlement agreement, the Bancorp had previously paid $ 46 million into a class settlement escrow account. Approximately 8,000 merchants requested exclusion from the class settlement, and therefore, pursuant to the terms of the overturned settlement agreement, approximately 25 % of the funds paid into the class settlement escrow account had been already returned to the control of the defendants. The remaining settlement funds paid by the Bancorp have been maintained in the escrow account. More than 500 of the merchants who requested exclusion from the class filed separate federal lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard and certain other defendants alleging similar antitrust violations. These individual federal lawsuits were transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. While the Bancorp is only named as a defendant in one of the individual federal lawsuits, it may have obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the judgment or loss sharing agreements noted above. On September 17, 2018, the defendants in the consolidated class action signed a second settlement agreement (the &#8220;Amended Settlement Agreement&#8221;) resolving the claims seeking monetary damages by the proposed plaintiffs&#8217; class (the &#8220;Plaintiff Damages Class&#8221;) and superseding the original settlement agreement entered into in October 2012. The Amended Settlement Agreement included, among other terms, a release from participating class members for liability for claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement Agreement becomes final. The Amended Settlement Agreement provided for a total payment by all defendants of approximately $ 6.24 billion, composed of approximately $ 5.34 billion held in escrow plus an additional $ 900 million in new funds. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, $ 700 million of the additional $ 900 million has been returned to the defendants due to the level of opt-outs from the class. The Bancorp&#8217;s allocated share of the settlement is within existing reserves, including funds maintained in escrow. On December 13, 2019, the Court entered an order granting final approval for the settlement, which is currently pending appeal. The settlement does not resolve the claims of the separate proposed plaintiffs&#8217; class seeking injunctive relief or the claims of merchants who have opted out of the proposed class settlement and are pursuing, or may in the future decide to pursue, private lawsuits. On September 27, 2021, the Court entered an order certifying a class of merchants pursuing claims for injunctive relief. The ultimate outcome in this matter, including the timing of resolution, remains uncertain. Refer to Note 18 for further information. 

Klopfenstein v. Fifth Third Bank 

On August 3, 2012, William Klopfenstein and Adam McKinney filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third Bank in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Klopfenstein et al. v. Fifth Third Bank), alleging that the 120 % APR that Fifth Third disclosed on its Early Access program was misleading. Early Access is a deposit-advance program offered to eligible customers with checking accounts. The plaintiffs sought to represent a nationwide class of customers who used the Early Access program and repaid their cash advances within 30 days. On October 31, 2012, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In 2013, four similar putative class action lawsuits were filed against Fifth Third Bank in federal courts throughout the country (Lori and Danielle Laskaris v. Fifth Third Bank, Janet Fyock v. Fifth Third Bank, Jesse McQuillen v. Fifth Third Bank, and Brian Harrison v. Fifth Third Bank). Those four lawsuits were transferred to the Southern District of Ohio and consolidated with the original lawsuit as In re: Fifth Third Early Access Cash Advance Litigation (Case No. 1:12-CV-851). On behalf of a putative class, the plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary and statutory damages, injunctive relief, punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On March 30, 2015, the court dismissed all claims alleged in the consolidated lawsuit except a claim under the TILA. On May 28, 2019, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs&#8217; breach of contract claim and remanded for further proceedings. The plaintiffs&#8217; claimed damages for the alleged breach of contract claim exceed $ 280 million. On March 26, 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification. No trial date has been set. 

Helton v. Fifth Third Bank 

On August 31, 2015, trust beneficiaries filed an action against Fifth Third Bank, as trustee, in the Probate Court for Hamilton County, Ohio (Helen Clarke Helton, et al. v. Fifth Third Bank, Case No. 2015003814). The plaintiffs alleged breach of the duty to diversify, breach of the duty of impartiality, breach of trust/fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment, based on Fifth Third&#8217;s alleged failure to diversify assets held in two trusts for the plaintiffs&#8217; benefit. The lawsuit sought over $ 800 million in alleged damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, removal of Fifth Third as trustee, and injunctive relief. On April 20, 2018, the Court denied plaintiffs&#8217; motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to Fifth Third, dismissing the case in its entirety. On December 18, 2019, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the Probate Court&#8217;s dismissal of all of plaintiffs&#8217; claims based upon allegations of Fifth Third&#8217;s alleged failure to diversify assets held in two trusts for plaintiffs&#8217; benefit. The appeals court reversed summary judgment on one claim related to Fifth Third&#8217;s alleged unjust enrichment through its receipt of certain fees in managing the trusts. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Probate Court for further consideration of the lone surviving claim, which comprises a small fraction of the damages originally sought by plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Ohio Supreme

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Court, seeking review of the decision from the Ohio Court of Appeals. On April 14, 2020, the Ohio Supreme Court announced its denial of plaintiffs&#8217; request for review, and subsequently denied plaintiffs&#8217; request for reconsideration. Thereafter, the case returned to the trial court for further adjudication of the lone surviving claim. On July 28, 2021 the trial court issued an order granting summary judgment to Fifth Third on a portion of plaintiffs&#8217; unjust enrichment claim, leaving the remainder of the claim to be resolved at trial. Plaintiffs have appealed the order granting partial summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim and the trial court has vacated the trial date. 

Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection v. Fifth Third Bank, National Association 

On March 9, 2020, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entitled CFPB v. Fifth Third Bank, National Association, Case No. 1:20-CV-1683 (N.D. Ill.) (ABW), alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, TILA, and Truth in Savings Act related to Fifth Third&#8217;s alleged opening of unspecified numbers of allegedly unauthorized credit card, savings, checking, online banking and early access accounts from 2010 through 2016. The CFPB seeks unspecified amounts of civil monetary penalties as well as unspecified customer remediation. On February 12, 2021, the court granted Fifth Third&#8217;s motion to transfer venue to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The Bancorp was also subject to a consumer class action lawsuit related to the alleged opening of unauthorized accounts (Zanni v. Fifth Third Bank, et al., Case 1:21-cv-00173-DRC); however, this matter was voluntarily dismissed in July 2021. 

Shareholder Litigation 

On April 7, 2020, Plaintiff Lee Christakis filed a putative class action lawsuit against Fifth Third Bancorp, Fifth Third Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg D. Carmichael, and former Fifth Third Chief Financial Officer Tayfun Tuzun in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entitled Lee Christakis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Fifth Third Bancorp, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-2176 (N.D. Ill). The case brings two claims for violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that the Defendants made material misstatements and omissions in connection with the alleged unauthorized opening of credit card, savings, checking, online banking and early access accounts from 2010 through 2016. The plaintiff seeks certification of a class, unspecified damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On June 29, 2020, the Court appointed Heavy &#38; General Laborers&#8217; Local 472 &#38; 172 Pension and Annuity Funds as lead plaintiff, and Robins Geller Rudman &#38; Dowd LLP as lead counsel for the plaintiff. On September 14, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed its amended consolidated complaint. On April 27, 2021, the Court granted the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss and provided plaintiff with leave to amend to attempt to cure the deficiencies. On October 8, 2021, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. 

On July 31, 2020, a second putative shareholder class action lawsuit captioned Dr. Steven Fox, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Fifth Third Bancorp, et al., Case No. 2020CH05219 was filed on behalf of former shareholders of MB Financial, Inc. in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court. The suit brings claims for violation of Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, alleging that the Bancorp and certain of its officers and directors made material misstatements and omissions regarding the alleged improper cross-selling strategy in filings made in connection with the Bancorp&#8217;s merger with MB Financial, Inc. On March 19, 2021, the trial court denied the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss. 

In addition, shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed seeking monetary damages on behalf of the Bancorp alleging certain claims against various officers and directors relating to an alleged improper cross-selling strategy. Five lawsuits have been consolidated into a single action pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois captioned In re Fifth Third Bancorp Derivative Litigation, Case No. 1:20-cv-04115. Those cases consist of: (1) Pemberton v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. 20-cv-4115 (filed July 13, 2020); (2) Meyer v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. 20-cv-4244 (filed July 17, 2020); (3) Cox v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. 20-cv-4660 (filed August 7, 2020); (4) Hansen v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. 20-cv-5339 (filed September 10, 2020); and (5) Reese v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01631 (filed November 4, 2020 originally as Case No. 20-cv-866 in the Southern District of Ohio). Also pending in the Hamilton County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas is Sandys v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. A2004539 (filed December 28, 2020) and The City of Miami Firefighters&#8217; and Police Officers&#8217; Retirement Trust v. Carmichael, et al., Case No. A2200330 (filed January 27, 2022). 

The Bancorp has also received several shareholder demands under Ohio Rev. Code &#167; 1701.37(c) and lawsuits have been filed arising out of the same. Finally, the Bancorp has received shareholder demands that the Bancorp&#8217;s Board of Directors investigate and commence a civil action for failure to detect and/or prevent the alleged illegal cross-selling strategy. One of those shareholders subsequently filed the aforementioned Sandys v. Carmichael, et al. matter. 

Other litigation 

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation. However, there are other litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent matters, management believes that the resulting liability, if any, from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the Bancorp&#8217;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Governmental Investigations and Proceedings 

The Bancorp and/or its affiliates are or may become involved in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to the FRB, OCC, CFPB, SEC, FINRA, U.S. Department of Justice, etc., as well as state and other governmental authorities and self-regulatory bodies regarding their respective businesses. Additional matters will likely arise from time to time. Any of these matters may result in 

191 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

material adverse consequences or reputational harm to the Bancorp, its affiliates and/or their respective directors, officers and other personnel, including adverse judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of the Bancorp&#8217;s SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. Investigations by regulatory authorities may from time to time result in civil or criminal referrals to law enforcement. Additionally, in some cases, regulatory authorities may take supervisory actions that are considered to be confidential supervisory information which may not be publicly disclosed. 

Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals 

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. The following factors, among others, contribute to this lack of predictability: claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp is not always able to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes for each claim. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accrual is adjusted from time to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. The Bancorp also determines, when possible (due to the uncertainties described above), estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued. Under U.S. GAAP, an event is &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; if &#8220;the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely&#8221; and an event is &#8220;remote&#8221; if &#8220;the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.&#8221; Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Bancorp is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Bancorp believes the risk of loss is more than slight. For matters where the Bancorp is able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, the Bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to legal and regulatory proceedings in an aggregate amount up to approximately $ 60 million in excess of amounts accrued, with it also being reasonably possible that no losses will be incurred in these matters. The estimates included in this amount are based on the Bancorp&#8217;s analysis of currently available information, and as new information is obtained the Bancorp may change its estimates. 

For these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses in excess of the established accrual that cannot be estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established accruals, the Bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Bancorp&#8217;s consolidated financial position. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Bancorp&#8217;s results of operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period.

20. Related Party Transactions 

The Bancorp maintains written policies and procedures covering related party transactions with principal shareholders, directors and executives of the Bancorp. These procedures cover transactions such as employee-stock purchase loans, personal lines of credit, residential secured loans, overdrafts, letters of credit and increases in indebtedness. Such transactions are subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s normal underwriting and approval procedures. Prior to approving a loan to a related party, Compliance Risk Management must review and determine whether the transaction requires approval from or a post notification to the Bancorp&#8217;s Board of Directors. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, certain directors, executive officers, principal holders of Bancorp common stock and their related interests were indebted, including undrawn commitments to lend, to the Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary. 

The following table summarizes the Bancorp&#8217;s lending activities with its principal shareholders, directors, executives and their related interests at December 31: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Commitments to lend, net of participations: Directors and their affiliated companies $ 157 &#160; 79 &#160; Executive officers 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Total $ 164 &#160; 86 &#160; Outstanding balance on loans, net of participations and undrawn commitments $ 115 &#160; 67 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The commitments to lend are in the form of loans and guarantees for various business and personal interests. This indebtedness was incurred in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated parties. This indebtedness does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other features unfavorable to the Bancorp. 

Worldpay, Inc. and Worldpay Holding, LLC 

On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of a majority interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC (now Worldpay Holding, LLC). Advent International acquired an approximate 51 % interest in Worldpay Holding, LLC for cash and a warrant. The Bancorp retained the remaining approximate 49 % interest in Worldpay Holding, LLC. 

During the first quarter of 2012, Vantiv, Inc. (now Worldpay, Inc.) priced an IPO of its shares and contributed the net proceeds to Worldpay Holding, LLC for additional ownership interests, reducing the Bancorp&#8217;s ownership percentage to 39 %. Subsequent to the IPO, the Bancorp consummated a series of sales transactions which culminated in the sale of all of its remaining interests in Worldpay Holding, LLC in the first quarter of 2019. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $ 562 million in other noninterest income during the first quarter of 2019 as a result of the final sale transaction. As of January 1, 2020, Worldpay Holding, LLC and Worldpay, Inc. were no longer considered related parties of the Bancorp as the Bancorp no longer beneficially owned any of Worldpay, Inc.&#8217;s equity securities. For further information on TRAs with Worldpay, Inc, refer to Note 15. 

The Bancorp and Worldpay Holding, LLC had various agreements in place covering services including interchange clearing, settlement and sponsorship. Worldpay Holding, LLC paid the Bancorp $ 87 million for these services for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to the previously mentioned services, the Bancorp previously entered into an agreement under which Worldpay Holding, LLC would provide processing services to the Bancorp. The total amount of fees relating to the processing services provided to the Bancorp by Worldpay Holding, LLC totaled $ 77 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These fees were primarily reported as a component of card and processing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Coforge Business Process Solutions Private Limited 

As of December 31, 2021, the Bancorp owns 100 % of Fifth Third Mauritius Holdings Limited, which owns 40 % of Coforge Business Process Solutions Private Limited (formerly known as SLK Global Solutions Private Limited), and accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. During the second quarter of 2021, Coforge Limited acquired a controlling interest in SLK Global Solutions Private Limited. As part of this transaction, the Bancorp sold a 9 % interest in SLK Global Solutions Private Limited to Coforge Limited and recognized a gain of $ 12 million as a result of the transaction. The Bancorp recognized $ 3 million, $ 5 million and $ 3 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as part of its equity method investment in Coforge Business Process Solutions Private Limited for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bancorp received cash distributions of $ 5 million and $ 1 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bancorp&#8217;s investment in Coforge Business Process Solutions Private Limited was $ 19 million and $ 26 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bancorp paid Coforge Business Process Solutions Private Limited $ 21 million, $ 27 million and $ 22 million for their process and software services during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

CDC investments 

The Bancorp holds equity investments in non-consolidated VIEs related to CDC. The Bancorp had loans outstanding to these VIEs of $ 22 million and $ 18 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as well as unfunded commitment balances of $ 36 million and 

193 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

$ 39 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bancorp also held $ 51 million and $ 63 million of deposits for these entities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For further information on CDC investments, refer to Note 12. 

21. Income Taxes 

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The following is a summary of applicable income taxes included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31:

The current U.S. Federal income taxes above include proportional amortization for qualifying LIHTC investments of $ 163 million, $ 150 million and $ 140 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The following is a reconciliation between the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate and the Bancorp&#8217;s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 Statutory tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; 21.0 &#160; Increase (decrease) resulting from: State taxes, net of federal benefit 2.5 &#160; 2.0 &#160; 2.8 &#160; Tax-exempt income ( 0.6 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 1.2 ) LIHTC investment and other tax benefits ( 5.5 ) ( 9.7 ) ( 5.0 ) LIHTC investment proportional amortization 4.6 &#160; 8.3 &#160; 4.4 &#160; Other tax credits ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 0.2 ) Other, net ( 0.6 ) 0.9 &#160; ( 0.2 ) Effective tax rate 21.2 &#160; % 20.6 &#160; 21.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Other tax credits in the rate reconciliation table include New Markets, Rehabilitation Investment and Qualified Zone Academy Bond tax credits. Tax-exempt income in the rate reconciliation table includes interest on municipal bonds, interest on tax-exempt lending, income on life insurance policies held by the Bancorp and certain gains on sales of leases that are exempt from federal taxation. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the Bancorp&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits: 

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Unrecognized tax benefits at January 1 $ 100 &#160; 65 &#160; 55 &#160; Gross increases for tax positions taken during prior period 10 &#160; 29 &#160; 25 &#160; Gross decreases for tax positions taken during prior period ( 4 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Gross increases for tax positions taken during current period 11 &#160; 12 &#160; 6 &#160; Settlements with taxing authorities &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 9 ) Lapse of applicable statute of limitations ( 15 ) ( 2 ) ( 9 ) 

Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 (a) 

$ 102 &#160; 100 &#160; 65 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(a) With the exception of $ 6 in 2020 and 2019, all amounts represent unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 primarily related to state income tax exposures from taking tax positions where the Bancorp believes it is likely that, upon examination, a state would take a position contrary to the position taken by the Bancorp. 

While it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the Bancorp&#8217;s uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease during the next twelve months, the Bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax benefits will change by a material amount during the next twelve months.

##TABLE_START ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan and lease losses $ 397 &#160; $ 515 &#160; Deferred compensation 106 &#160; 107 &#160; Reserve for unfunded commitments 38 &#160; 36 &#160; Reserves 30 &#160; 40 &#160; State net operating loss carryforwards 3 &#160; 3 &#160; State deferred taxes &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Other 202 &#160; 160 &#160; Total deferred tax assets $ 776 &#160; $ 862 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Lease financing $ 553 &#160; $ 638 &#160; Other comprehensive income 367 &#160; 779 &#160; MSRs and related economic hedges 116 &#160; 120 &#160; Goodwill and intangible assets 68 &#160; 62 &#160; Bank premises and equipment 65 &#160; 91 &#160; Investments in joint ventures and partnership interests 61 &#160; 58 &#160; State deferred taxes 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other 51 &#160; 66 &#160; Total deferred tax liabilities $ 1,287 &#160; $ 1,814 &#160; Total net deferred tax liability $ ( 511 ) $ ( 952 ) ##TABLE_END

At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp recorded deferred tax assets of $ 3 million related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax assets relating to state net operating losses are presented net of specific valuation allowances of $ 4 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. If these carryforwards are not utilized, they will expire in varying amounts through 2041. 

The Bancorp has determined that a valuation allowance is not needed against the remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. The Bancorp considered all of the positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and, based upon that evidence, the Bancorp believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2021 and 2020 will ultimately be realized. The Bancorp reached this conclusion as it is expected that the Bancorp&#8217;s remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through the reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences and its projected future taxable income. 

The IRS is currently examining the Bancorp&#8217;s 2019 federal income tax return. The statute of limitations for the Bancorp&#8217;s federal income tax returns remains open for tax years 2018 through 2021. In addition, the statute of limitations remains open for an acquired entity&#8217;s federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019. On occasion, as various state and local taxing jurisdictions examine the returns of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, the Bancorp may agree to extend the statute of limitations for a reasonable period of time. Otherwise, the statutes of limitations for state income tax returns remain open only for tax years in accordance with each state&#8217;s statutes. 

Any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of applicable income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Bancorp recognized $ 1 million, $ 3 million and $ 1 million, respectively, of interest expense in connection with income taxes. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp had accrued interest liabilities, net of the related tax benefits, of $ 7 million. No material liabilities were recorded for penalties related to income taxes. 

Retained earnings at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $ 157 million in allocations of earnings for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided. Under current tax law, if certain of the Bancorp&#8217;s subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at the current corporate tax rate.

22. Retirement and Benefit Plans 

The Bancorp&#8217;s qualified defined benefit plan&#8217;s benefits were frozen in 1998, except for grandfathered employees. The Bancorp&#8217;s other defined benefit retirement plans consist of non-qualified plans which are frozen and funded on an as-needed basis. A majority of these plans were obtained in acquisitions and are included with the qualified defined benefit plan in the following tables (&#8220;the Plan&#8221;). The Bancorp recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of the Plan in other assets and accrued taxes, interest and expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The following table summarizes the defined benefit retirement plans as of and for the years ended December 31:

(b) Includes corporate bonds. 

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Cash equivalents 

Cash equivalents are comprised of money market mutual funds that invest in short-term money market instruments that are issued and payable in U.S. dollars. The Plan measures its cash equivalent funds that are exchange-traded using the fund&#8217;s quoted price, which is in an active market. Therefore, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Mutual and exchange-traded funds 

The Plan measures its mutual and exchange-traded funds, which are registered with the SEC, using the funds&#8217; quoted prices which are available in an active market. Therefore, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The mutual and exchange-traded funds held by the Plan are open-ended funds and are required to publicly publish their NAV on a daily basis. The funds are also required to transact and use the daily NAV as a basis for transactions. Therefore, the NAV reflects the fair value of the Plan&#8217;s investment. 

Debt securities 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models which primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Examples of such instruments, which are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include federal agencies securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities. 

Plan Assumptions 

The Plan&#8217;s assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as necessary. The discount rate assumption reflects the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments that have a similar duration to the Plan&#8217;s liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects the average return expected on the assets invested to provide for the Plan&#8217;s liabilities. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Bancorp evaluated actuarial and economic inputs, including long-term inflation rate assumptions and broad equity and bond indices long-term return projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance. 

The following table summarizes the weighted-average plan assumptions for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 For measuring benefit obligations at year end: Discount rate 2.85 &#160; % 2.26 &#160; 3.05 &#160; For measuring net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 2.26 &#160; 3.05 &#160; 4.10 &#160; Expected return on plan assets 2.43 &#160; 2.64 &#160; 5.50 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate by 0.25% would have increased the 2021 pension expense by approximately $ 1 million. 

Based on the actuarial assumptions, the Bancorp expects to contribute $ 2 million to the Plan in 2022. Estimated pension benefit payments are $ 17 million for 2022, $ 16 million for 2023, $ 15 million for 2024, $ 17 million for 2025 and $ 14 million for 2026. The total estimated payments for the years 2027 through 2031 is $ 59 million.

Investment Policies and Strategies 

The Bancorp&#8217;s policy for the investment of Plan assets is to employ investment strategies that achieve a range of weighted-average target asset allocations relating to equity securities, fixed-income securities (including U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds), alternative strategies (including traditional mutual funds, precious metals and commodities) and cash. 

The following table provides the Bancorp&#8217;s targeted and actual weighted-average asset allocations by asset category, with mutual and exchange-traded funds incorporated according to their underlying investments, for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START Targeted Range 2021 2020 Equity securities 0 - 55 &#160;%

Plan Management&#8217;s objective is to achieve and maintain a fully-funded status of the qualified defined benefit plan while also minimizing the risk of excess assets. As a result, the portfolio assets of the qualified defined benefit plan will continue to increase the weighting of long duration fixed income, or liability matching assets, as the funded status increases. There were no significant concentrations of risk associated with the investments of the Plan at December 31, 2021. 

Permitted asset classes of the Plan include cash and cash equivalents, fixed-income (domestic and non-U.S. bonds), equities (U.S., non-U.S., emerging markets and real estate investment trusts), equipment leasing and mortgages. The Plan utilizes derivative instruments including puts, calls, straddles or other option strategies, as approved by management. 

Fifth Third Bank, National Association, as Trustee, is expected to manage Plan assets in a manner consistent with the Plan agreement and other regulatory, federal and state laws. The Fifth Third Bank Pension, 401(k) and Medical Plan Committee (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) is the plan administrator. The Trustee is required to provide to the Committee monthly and quarterly reports covering a list of Plan assets, portfolio performance, transactions and asset allocation. The Trustee is also required to keep the Committee apprised of any material changes in the Trustee&#8217;s outlook and recommended investment policy. There were no fees paid by the Plan for investment management, accounting or administrative services provided by the Trustee. 

Other Information on Retirement and Benefit Plans 

The Bancorp has a qualified defined contribution savings plan that allows participants to make voluntary 401(k) contributions on a pre-tax or Roth basis, subject to statutory limitations. Expenses recognized for matching contributions to the Bancorp&#8217;s qualified defined contribution savings plan were $ 108 million, $ 105 million and $ 90 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bancorp did no t make profit sharing contributions during both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Bancorp recognized $ 4 million of profit sharing expense associated with the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the Bancorp has a non-qualified defined contribution plan that allows certain employees to make voluntary contributions into a deferred compensation plan. Expenses recognized by the Bancorp for its non-qualified defined contribution plan were $ 5 million, $ 5 million and $ 6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Preferred Stock&#8212;Series L 

On July 30, 2020, the Bancorp issued in a registered public offering 350,000 depositary shares, representing 14,000 shares of 4.50 % fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series L, for net proceeds of approximately $ 346 million. Each preferred share has a $ 25,000 liquidation preference. The preferred stock accrues dividends on a non-cumulative basis at an annual rate of 4.50 % through but excluding September 30, 2025. From, and including, September 30, 2025 and for each dividend reset period thereafter, dividends will accrue on the Series L preferred stock, on a non-cumulative basis, at a rate equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date plus 4.215 %. Dividends will be payable, when, as and if declared by the Bancorp&#8217;s Board of Directors, quarterly in arrears on each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, beginning on September 30, 2020. Subject to obtaining all required regulatory approvals, on any dividend payment date on or after September 30, 2025, the Bancorp may redeem the Series L preferred stock and the related depositary shares in whole or in part, at 100 % of their liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. In addition, the Series L preferred stock and the related depositary shares may be redeemed, subject to obtaining all required regulatory approvals, in whole but not in part, at any time, following the occurrence of a regulatory capital event, at 100 % of their liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series L preferred shares are not convertible into Bancorp common shares or any other securities.

Treasury Stock 

In June of 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the Bancorp to repurchase up to 100 million common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and to utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase transactions. 

Under this authorization, the Bancorp entered into and settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Bancorp did not enter into any accelerated repurchase transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume-weighted average price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock during the term of these repurchase agreements. The accelerated share repurchases were treated as two separate transactions: (i) the repurchase of treasury shares on the repurchase date and (ii) a forward contract indexed to the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock. 

The following table presents a summary of the Bancorp&#8217;s accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into and settled during the year ended December 31, 2021:

25. Stock-Based Compensation 

Stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Bancorp&#8217;s Incentive Compensation Plan to executives, directors and key employees of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The 2021 Incentive Compensation Plan was approved by shareholders on April 13, 2021 and authorized the issuance of up to 50 million shares, as equity compensation and provides for SARs, RSAs, RSUs, stock options, performance share or unit awards, dividend or dividend equivalent rights and stock awards. As of December 31, 2021, there were 48.8 million shares available for future issuance. Based on total stock-based awards outstanding (including SARs, RSUs, stock options and PSAs) and shares remaining for future grants under the 2021 Incentive Compensation Plan, the potential dilution to which the Bancorp&#8217;s common shareholders are exposed due to the potential that stock-based compensation will be awarded to executives, directors or key employees of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries is 10 %. SARs, RSUs, stock options and PSAs outstanding represent 3 % of the Bancorp&#8217;s issued shares at December 31, 2021. 

All of the Bancorp&#8217;s stock-based awards are to be settled with stock. The Bancorp has historically used treasury stock to settle stock-based awards, when available. SARs, issued at fair value based on the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant, have terms up to ten years and vest and typically become exercisable ratably over a three or four-year period of continued employment. The Bancorp does not grant discounted SARs or stock options, re-price previously granted SARs or stock options or grant reload stock options. RSAs and RSUs are typically released after three or four years or ratably over three or four years of continued employment. RSAs include dividend and voting rights while RSUs receive dividend equivalents only. Dividend equivalents are accrued and paid in cash when the underlying shares are distributed, except for certain RSUs which have the rights to receive dividend equivalents paid in cash at each dividend payment date. For PSAs that are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, the accrued cash dividends are adjusted by the payout percentage achieved on the underlying awards. Stock options were previously issued at fair value based on the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant, had up to ten year terms and vested and became fully exercisable ratably over a three or four-year period of continued employment. PSAs have three-year cliff vesting terms with performance conditions as defined by the plan. All of the Bancorp&#8217;s executive stock-based awards contain an annual performance hurdle of 2 % return on tangible common equity. If this threshold is not met in any one of the three years during the performance period, one-third of PSAs are forfeited. Additionally, if this threshold is not met, all SARs, RSAs and RSUs that would vest in the next year may also be forfeited at the discretion of the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Bancorp met this threshold as of December 31, 2021. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement with MB Financial, Inc., the Bancorp granted stock-based awards to replace those awards previously granted by MB Financial, Inc. that were outstanding as of March 22, 2019. The replacement awards included RSAs, RSUs, and stock options. Approximately 1.65 replacement awards were granted to replace each outstanding MB Financial, Inc. award and the strike prices of replacement stock options were also adjusted to reflect this exchange ratio. Otherwise, the replacement awards were granted with substantially the same terms as the MB Financial, Inc. awards that were being replaced, including vesting and expiration dates. 

The fair value of the awards being replaced and the replacement awards were measured as of the date of the merger. The portion of the fair value of the awards being replaced which was attributable to pre-combination service was included as a component of the consideration paid in the merger. The portion attributable to post-combination service, in addition to any increased value of the replacement awards over the awards being replaced, was recognized as stock-based compensation expense over each award&#8217;s remaining service period. 

Stock-based compensation expense was $ 120 million, $ 123 million and $ 132 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total related income tax benefit recognized was $ 25 million, $ 26 million and $ 27 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Stock Appreciation Rights 

The Bancorp uses assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as necessary, in estimating the grant-date fair value of each SAR grant. 

The weighted-average assumptions were as follows for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 Expected life (in years) 7 7 7 Expected volatility 29 &#160; % 24 &#160; 32 &#160; Expected dividend yield 3.2 &#160; 3.2 &#160; 3.3 &#160; Risk-free interest rate 0.9 &#160; 1.5 &#160; 2.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The expected life is generally derived from historical exercise patterns and represents the amount of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock. The expected dividend yield is based on annual dividends divided by the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price. Annual dividends are based on projected dividends, estimated using an expected long-term dividend payout ratio, over the estimated life of the awards. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the SARs is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 

The grant-date fair value of SARs is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of SARs granted was $ 7.84 , $ 6.82 and $ 7.38 per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total grant-date

fair value of SARs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 8 million, $ 15 million and $ 20 million, respectively. 

At December 31, 2021, there was $ 1 million of stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding SARs not yet recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated remaining weighted-average period at December 31, 2021 of 1.8 years.

Stock Options 

There were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, except for replacement stock option awards assumed in conjunction with the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. While the Bancorp has historically utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock option grants, the fair value of these grants were measured using the Hull-White option pricing model as it was expected to provide a more precise estimate of fair value in a business combination scenario. The assumptions used in the valuation model varied for each grant tranche, but included expected volatility of 23 %- 29 %, no expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rates of 2.34 %- 2.51 %, a departure rate of 10 % and exercise ratios of 2.2 - 2.8 . The replacement stock option awards had a weighted-average time to maturity of 5.4 years as of March 22, 2019. 

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 7 million, $ 3 million and $ 7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised was $ 6 million, $ 5 million and $ 11 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax benefit realized from exercised stock options was $ 1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. An immaterial amount of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of both outstanding stock options and exercisable stock options was $ 9 million.

Other Stock-Based Compensation 

PSAs are payable contingent upon the Bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets over a three-year measurement period. Depending on performance, between zero and 1.2 million shares may be released to settle the PSAs outstanding at December 31, 2021 once the applicable performance periods are completed. Awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 will be entirely settled in stock. The performance targets are based on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance relative to a defined peer group. PSAs use a performance-based metric based on return on tangible common equity in relation to peers. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 251 thousand, 280 thousand and 328 thousand PSAs, respectively, were granted by the Bancorp. These awards were granted at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $ 33.53 , $ 29.64 and $ 26.72 per unit during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The Bancorp sponsors an employee stock purchase plan that allows qualifying employees to purchase shares of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock with a 15 % match.

28. Fair Value Measurements 

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Bancorp measures fair value, refer to Note 1.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Available-for-sale debt and other securities, trading debt securities and equity securities 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models which primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 2 securities may include federal agencies securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities and equity securities. These securities are generally valued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics. 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale 

For residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made, fair value is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio 

210 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the ARM margin. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on external pricing for similar instruments. ARM loans classified as held for sale are also classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the DCF model. These observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount rates. 

Residential mortgage loans 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are reclassified to held for investment are transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For residential mortgage loans for which the fair value election has been made, and that are reclassified from held for sale to held for investment, the fair value estimation is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component. Therefore, these loans are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An adverse change in the loss rate or severity assumption would result in a decrease in fair value of the related loans. 

Servicing rights 

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, the Bancorp estimates the fair value of MSRs using internal OAS models with certain unobservable inputs, primarily prepayment speed assumptions, OAS and weighted-average lives, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the assumptions used in the valuation of the Bancorp&#8217;s MSRs. 

Derivatives 

Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Most of the Bancorp&#8217;s derivative contracts are valued using DCF or other models that incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity swaps and options. Derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, derivatives classified as Level 3, which are valued using models containing unobservable inputs, consisted primarily of a total return swap associated with the Bancorp&#8217;s sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares as well as IRLCs, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process. 

Under the terms of the total return swap, the Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B Shares into Class A Shares. Additionally, the Bancorp will make a quarterly payment based on Visa&#8217;s stock price and the conversion rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B Shares into Class A Shares until the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. The fair value of the total return swap was calculated using a DCF model based on unobservable inputs consisting of management&#8217;s estimate of the probability of certain litigation scenarios, the timing of the resolution of the Covered Litigation and Visa litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of the Bancorp&#8217;s proportional share of escrow funds. 

An increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in an increase in the fair value of the derivative liability; conversely, a decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in a decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the Covered Litigation. 

The net asset fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s IRLCs at December 31, 2021 was $ 12 million. Immediate decreases in current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in increases in the fair value of the IRLCs of approximately $ 5 million and $ 9 million, respectively. Immediate increases of current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in decreases in the fair value of the IRLCs of approximately $ 5 million and $ 11 million, respectively. The decrease in fair value of IRLCs due to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $ 1 million and $ 2 million, respectively, and the increase in fair value due to immediate 10% and 20% favorable changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $ 1 million and $ 2 million, respectively. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. 

Short positions 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, short positions are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models which primarily utilize quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 2 securities include asset-backed and other debt securities.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.

Commercial loans held for sale 

The Bancorp estimated the fair value of certain commercial loans held for sale during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, resulting in a positive fair value adjustment of $ 1 million and a negative fair value adjustment of $ 5 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These valuations were based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets (Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy), appraisals of the underlying collateral or by applying unobservable inputs such as an estimated market discount to the unpaid principal balance of the loans or the appraised values of the assets (Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy). The Bancorp recognized gains on the sale of 

214 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

certain commercial loans held for sale of $ 1 million and an immaterial amount during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Portfolio loans and leases 

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain collateral-dependent portfolio loans and leases. When a loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally based on the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and therefore these loans were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the amortized cost basis of the loan or lease exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the collateral, then an ALLL is recognized, or a charge-off once the remaining amount is considered uncollectible. 

OREO 

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties and branch-related real estate no longer intended to be used for banking purposes classified as OREO and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. These nonrecurring losses were primarily due to declines in real estate values of the properties recorded in OREO. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, these losses include $ 5 million and $ 3 million in losses, respectively, recorded as charge-offs on new OREO properties transferred from loans during the respective periods and $ 1 million and $ 4 million, respectively, recorded as negative fair value adjustments on OREO in other noninterest expense or other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income subsequent to their transfer into OREO. The fair value amounts are generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. The previous tables reflect the fair value measurements of the properties before deducting the estimated costs to sell. 

Bank premises and equipment 

The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. These properties were written down to their lower of cost or market values. At least annually thereafter, the Bancorp will review these properties for market fluctuations. The fair value amounts were generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information on bank premises and equipment, refer to Note 7. 

Operating lease equipment 

The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. When evaluating whether an individual asset is impaired, the Bancorp considers the current fair value of the asset, the changes in overall market demand for the asset and the rate of change in advancements associated with technological improvements that impact the demand for the specific asset under review. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp determined that the carrying values of certain operating lease equipment were not recoverable and as a result, the Bancorp recorded an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value. The fair value amounts were generally based on appraised values of the assets, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Private equity investments 

The Bancorp accounts for its private equity investments using the measurement alternative to fair value, except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the measurement alternative, the Bancorp carries each investment at its cost basis minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The Bancorp recognized gains of $ 41 million and $ 23 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting from observable price changes. The carrying value of the Bancorp&#8217;s private equity investments still held as of December 31, 2021 includes a cumulative $ 68 million of positive adjustments as a result of observable price changes since January 1, 2018. Because these adjustments are based on observable transactions in inactive markets, they are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

For private equity investments which are accounted for using the measurement alternative to fair value, the Bancorp qualitatively evaluates each investment quarterly to determine if impairment may exist. If necessary, the Bancorp then measures impairment by estimating the value of its investment and comparing that to the investment&#8217;s carrying value, whether or not the Bancorp considers the impairment to be temporary. These valuations are typically developed using a DCF method, but other methods may be used if more appropriate for the circumstances. These valuations are based on unobservable inputs and therefore are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Bancorp recognized impairments of $ 3 million and $ 9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The carrying value of the Bancorp&#8217;s private equity investments still held as of December 31, 2021 includes a cumulative $ 24 million of impairment charges recognized since adoption of the measurement alternative to fair value on January 1, 2018. 

Fair Value Option 

The Bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under U.S. GAAP. Electing to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. Management&#8217;s intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets 

215 Fifth Third Bancorp 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and maintained in the Bancorp&#8217;s loan portfolio. In such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value. 

Fair value changes recognized in earnings for residential mortgage loans held at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying IRLCs, included gains of $ 28 million and $ 75 million, respectively. These gains are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Valuation adjustments related to instrument-specific credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively impacted the fair value of those loans by an immaterial amount and $ 1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest on loans measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned using the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value as of:

The Bancorp invests in certain hybrid financial instruments with embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contracts. The Bancorp has elected to measure the entire instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The carrying value of these investments was $ 89 million as of December 31, 2021 and the investments are classified as trading debt securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value changes recognized in earnings included losses of $ 3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, reported in securities (losses) gains, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

29. Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Ratios 

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a BHC. These guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; status. Additionally, the Banking Agencies issued similar guidelines for minimum regulatory capital requirements and &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; measurements for banking subsidiaries. 

The following table summarizes the prescribed capital ratios for the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary. 

##TABLE_START Minimum Well-Capitalized CET1 capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.50 &#160; % N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association 4.50 &#160; 6.50 &#160; Tier 1 risk-based capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 6.00 &#160; 6.00 &#160; Fifth Third Bank, National Association 6.00 &#160; 8.00 &#160; Total risk-based capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 8.00 &#160; 10.00 &#160; Fifth Third Bank, National Association 8.00 &#160; 10.00 &#160; Leverage: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.00 &#160; N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association 4.00 &#160; 5.00 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements or falling below the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; measure can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bancorp. On October 1, 2020, the Bancorp became subject to the stress capital buffer requirement. Institutions subject to the stress capital buffer requirement must maintain capital ratios above their respective buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed on June 24, 2021. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 

The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary, Fifth Third Bank, National Association, had CET1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Total risk-based capital and Leverage ratios above the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; levels at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. To continue to qualify for financial holding company status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary must, among other things, maintain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital ratios.

31. Business Segments 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following is a description of each of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases. 

Commercial Banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and government and professional customers. In addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, Commercial Banking products and services include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance. 

Branch Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan and lease products to individuals and small businesses through 1,117 full-service banking centers. Branch Banking offers depository and loan products, such as checking and savings accounts, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards and loans for automobiles and other personal financing needs, as well as products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services. 

Consumer Lending includes the Bancorp&#8217;s residential mortgage, automobile and other indirect lending activities. Residential mortgage activities within Consumer Lending include the origination, retention and servicing of residential mortgage loans, sales and securitizations of those loans and all associated hedging activities. Residential mortgages are primarily originated through a dedicated sales force and through third-party correspondent lenders. Automobile and other indirect lending activities include extending loans to consumers through automobile dealers, motorcycle dealers, powersport dealers, recreational vehicle dealers and marine dealers. 

Wealth and Asset Management provides a full range of wealth management services for individuals, companies and not-for-profit organizations. Wealth and Asset Management is made up of three main businesses: FTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp; Fifth Third Private Bank; and Fifth Third Institutional Services. FTS offers full service retail brokerage services to individual clients and broker-dealer services to the institutional marketplace. Fifth Third Private Bank offers wealth management strategies to high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients through wealth planning, investment management, banking, insurance, trust and estate services. Fifth Third Institutional Services provides advisory services for institutional clients including middle market businesses, non-profits, states and municipalities.
