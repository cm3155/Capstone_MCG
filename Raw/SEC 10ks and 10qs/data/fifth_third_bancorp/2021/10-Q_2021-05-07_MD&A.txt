FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains statements that we believe are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, capital actions or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as &#8220;will likely result,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;are expected to,&#8221; &#8220;is anticipated,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;projected,&#8221; &#8220;intends to,&#8221; or may include other similar words or phrases such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;remain,&#8221; or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; or similar verbs.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At March 31, 2021, the Bancorp had $207 billion in assets and operated 1,098 full-service banking centers and 2,383 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 61% and 39% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from commercial banking revenue, service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, leasing business expense, equipment expense, card and processing expense, marketing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020, which has continued into 2021. Government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of businesses and the implementation of social distancing protocols, have caused and continue to cause, reductions and instability in economic activity that have resulted in increased unemployment levels in certain industries and volatility in the financial markets. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, low interest rates, reduced economic activity and market volatility have had the most immediate negative impacts on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance. The Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and it is likely that these factors will continue to adversely impact its future operating results. The increased availability of COVID-19 vaccinations has begun to mitigate the public health effects of the pandemic but the recovery 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

from the related economic crisis continues to disproportionately affect certain industries, geographies and demographics more than others. This uneven recovery, combined with the unprecedented nature of the government response to the pandemic, make it difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to adversely impact the Bancorp and its customers. 

The Bancorp has provided a variety of relief options for both commercial and consumer customers that were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan covenant relief, loan maturity extensions, payment deferrals, forbearances and fee waivers. For further information about these programs, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A included herein, and also Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Government Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized. 

The CARES Act 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and has subsequently been amended several times, including by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Among other provisions, the CARES Act included funding for the SBA to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as TDRs, direct stimulus payments and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. One of the key CARES Act programs is the Paycheck Protection Program, discussed further below, which has temporarily expanded the SBA&#8217;s business loan guarantee program. 

The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have independently extended their moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for single-family federally backed mortgages until at least June 30, 2021. 

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds have been used to support several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act which meet certain criteria. 

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, offset forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB established a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

The Bancorp is a participating lender in PPP, which is a program administered by the SBA to provide forgivable, guaranteed loans to eligible borrowers that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2021, the Bancorp held PPP loans with a carrying amount of $5.4 billion under the program. PPP loans are available to a broader range of entities than ordinary SBA loans, require deferral of principal and interest repayment, and may be forgiven if the borrower demonstrates that the loan proceeds were used for qualified payroll costs and certain other expenses. The PPP has been expanded to permit second and third rounds of funding, including for certain borrowers who have already received a PPP loan, subject to certain conditions. 

American Rescue Plan Act 

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 21, 2021, provides additional relief for businesses, states, municipalities and individuals by, among other things, allocating additional funds for the PPP and by providing a third round of economic 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

impact payments to individuals. The American Rescue Plan is expected to positively impact the U.S. economy. However, the impacts of the stimulus on the Bancorp&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy in general. 

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Bancorp entered into and settled an accelerated share repurchase transaction. As part of the transaction, the Bancorp entered into a forward contract in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock during the term of the repurchase agreement. Refer to Note 15 and Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. 

The following table presents a summary of the Bancorp&#8217;s accelerated share repurchase transaction that was entered into and settled during the three months ended March 31, 2021: 

TABLE 1: Summary of Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction Repurchase Date Amount ($ in millions) Shares Repurchased on Repurchase Date Shares Received from Forward Contract Settlement Total Shares Repurchased Settlement Date January 26, 2021 $ 180 4,951,456 366,939 5,318,395 March 31, 2021 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. The Bancorp has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products within its commercial lending, commercial deposits, business banking, consumer lending and capital markets lines of business as well as corporate treasury function. On November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued a public statement that the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on an extension of publication of certain U.S. Dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, which would allow additional legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before the succession of LIBOR. The administrator then announced on March 5, 2021, that it will cease publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and that overnight and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month USD LIBOR will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp continues to prepare to transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, and it is expected that a broad transition away from the use of LIBOR to alternative reference rates for new financial contracts will occur by the end of 2021. In the United States, it is likely that LIBOR-priced transactions and products will transfer to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). There are risks inherent with the transition to any alternative rate such as SOFR as the rates may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. The Bancorp is currently in the process of developing new products and transaction agreements which are based on reference rates other than LIBOR. The Bancorp is also in the process of developing a transition plan for existing LIBOR-based financial contracts that are not expected to mature or settle prior to the cessation of LIBOR publication. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs:

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2021 was $674 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, which was net of $20 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2020 was $29 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, which was net of $17 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of $54 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower market rates. Compared to the prior year, market rates in the first quarter of 2021 were adversely impacted by 2020 monetary policy actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to lower the target range of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond purchase programs. The Bancorp has significant portfolios of floating interest rate loans, which are primarily LIBOR- or Prime-based, which decreased the yield on total average loans and leases by 76 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans decreased 65 bps, 138 bps and 162 bps, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolios of fixed interest rate loans also decreased in yield as a result of increased refinance activity and lower reinvestment yields due to lower overall market rates. In addition to 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

market rate impacts on earning assets, net interest income was also negatively impacted by a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans of $2.0 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2020. Interest income recognized from PPP loans partially offset these negative impacts. The Bancorp was able to partially offset the decrease in earning asset yields by decreasing rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities by 65 bps. The decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of 68 bps and 67 bps, respectively, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 3.28% for the comparable period in the prior year. 

The benefit from credit losses was $173 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to provision for credit losses of $640 million during the same period in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by factors which caused a decrease in the ACL from December 31, 2020, including improved economic forecasts, improved consumer credit quality and decreases in nonperforming loans and commercial criticized assets. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.27% and 0.44% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At March 31, 2021, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.72% compared to 0.79% at December 31, 2020. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income increased $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest income, commercial banking revenue and leasing business revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue. Other noninterest income increased $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in private equity investment losses as well as a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. Commercial banking revenue increased $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in institutional sales and loan syndication fees, partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives. Leasing business revenue increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in lease syndication fees, partially offset by a decrease in lease remarketing fees. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by an increase in origination fees and gains on loan sales. 

Noninterest expense increased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest expense and marketing expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in non-qualified deferred compensation expense and higher performance-related expenses. Other noninterest expense decreased $34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in losses and adjustments and travel expense, partially offset by an increase in loan and lease expense. Marketing expense decreased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a pause or slowdown in numerous marketing campaigns, including running less advertising, as well as the suspension of cash bonuses and other account acquisition programs.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of a significant new accounting standard applicable to the Bancorp. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Table 6 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of $54 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower market rates. Compared to the prior year, market rates in the first quarter of 2021 were adversely impacted by 2020 monetary policy actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to lower the target range of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond purchase programs. The Bancorp has significant portfolios of floating interest rate loans, which are primarily LIBOR- or Prime-based, which decreased the yield on total average loans and leases by 76 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans decreased 65 bps, 138 bps and 162 bps, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolios of fixed interest rate loans also decreased in yield as a result of increased refinance activity and lower reinvestment yields due to lower overall market rates. In addition to market rate impacts on earning assets, net interest income was also negatively impacted by a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans of $2.0 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2020. Interest income recognized from PPP loans partially offset these negative impacts. The Bancorp was able to partially offset the decrease in earning asset yields by decreasing rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities by 65 bps. The decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of 68 bps and 67 bps, respectively, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.46% during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 2.98% in the same period in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets decreased 117 bps, partially offset by a decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 65 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 3.28% for the comparable period in the prior year. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by an increase in low-yielding reserves held at the FRB reported in other short-term investments, which was driven by increases in average demand deposits and average interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year . Net interest margin results are expected to remain suppressed as a result of increased liquidity levels in the form of excess cash balances which are expected to remain at elevated levels driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus that has increased the banking industry&#8217;s balance sheets, including the Bancorp&#8217;s. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases decreased $207 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 driven by the previously mentioned decreases in yields on average loans and leases. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments decreased $17 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in yields on average taxable securities and average other short-term investments, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of other short-term investments. 

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $132 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 6 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from 68 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits was primarily due to the previously mentioned decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

In terest expense on average wholesale funding decreased $38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in rates paid on and average balances of long-term debt and certificates $100,000

and over. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, average wholesale funding represented 16% of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 20% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The benefit from credit losses was $173 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to a provision for credit losses of $640 million during the same period in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by factors which caused a decrease in the ACL from December 31, 2020, including improved economic forecasts, improved consumer credit quality and decreases in nonperforming loans and criticized assets in the commercial loan and lease portfolio. Also, the provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was significantly affected by deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and increased utilization levels on commercial loans. 

The ALLL decreased $245 million from December 31, 2020 to $2.2 billion at March 31, 2021. At March 31, 2021, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 2.03%, compared to 2.25% at December 31, 2020. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $1 million from December 31, 2020 to $173 million at March 31, 2021. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 2.19% at March 31, 2021, compared to 2.41% at December 31, 2020. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio, ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income increased $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue increased $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in institutional sales and loan syndication fees of $22 million and $9 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives of $7 million. 

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits decreased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 driven by a decrease of $9 million in consumer deposit fees due to lower overdraft occurrences as a result of the impact of fiscal stimulus programs, partially offset by an increase of $5 million in commercial deposit fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily driven by increases in private client service fees and broker income of $9 million and $4 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in institutional fees of $3 million. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

approximately $464 billion and $374 billion in total assets under care as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and managed $58 billion and $42 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in consumer customer spend volume as well as lower reward costs. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in lease syndication fees of $40 million, partially offset by a decrease in lease remarketing fees of $25 million. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 8: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 89 &#160; 81 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 59 &#160; 67 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs 

(63) (28) Net mortgage servicing revenue (4) 39 Total mortgage banking net revenue $ 85 &#160; 120 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily driven by an increase in originations and gains on loan sales due to the lower interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $4.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $4.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue decreased $43 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in net negative valuation adjustments of $35 million as well as a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees of $8 million. Refer to Table 9 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

$ (63) (28) 

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Bancorp recognized $71 million of income in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The fair value of the MSR portfolio increased $152 million due to changes to inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Assumptions were updated as a result of market rate changes during the first quarter of 2021. An increase in mortgage rates resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds, and a tightening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates resulted in a decrease in the modeled OAS assumptions. The fair value impact of the assumption changes was partially offset by an $81 million impact from contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

Mortgage rates decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2020, which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $331 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and OAS 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

assumptions and decreased $47 million due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of $2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to net gains of $3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020, recorded in securities (losses) gains, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $86.7 billion and $99.8 billion, respectively, with $65.9 billion and $81.9 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Other noninterest income 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income:

Other noninterest income increased $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in private equity investment losses as well as a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. 

Private equity investment losses decreased $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by valuation adjustments and impairment charges recognized on certain private equity investments during the three months ended March 31, 2020. For additional information on the valuation of private equity investments, refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $13 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $22 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense increased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest expense and marketing expense. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense:

(a) This is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

Compensation and benefits expense increased $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in non-qualified deferred compensation expense and higher performance-related expenses. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,819 at March 31, 2021 compared to 20,182 at March 31, 2020. 

Marketing expense decreased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a pause or slowdown in numerous marketing campaigns, including running less advertising, as well as the suspension of cash bonuses and other account acquisition programs. 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest expense: 

TABLE 12: Components of Other Noninterest Expense For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Loan and lease $ 49 &#160; 35 FDIC insurance and other taxes 28 &#160; 25 Data processing 20 &#160; 18 Professional service fees 16 &#160; 10 Intangible amortization 11 &#160; 13 Postal and courier 9 &#160; 10 Losses and adjustments 7 &#160; 54 Travel 4 &#160; 15 Recruitment and education 4 &#160; 6 Insurance 4 &#160; 4 Supplies 3 &#160; 4 Donations 2 &#160; 3 Other, net 58 &#160; 52 Total other noninterest expense $ 215 &#160; 249 

Other noninterest expense decreased $34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in losses and adjustments and travel expense, partially offset by an increase in loan and lease expense. 

Losses and adjustments decreased $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decline in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts, partially offset by an increase in legal settlements. Travel expense decreased $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to reduced business travel as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan and lease expense 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in loan servicing expenses. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 13: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 883 &#160; 60 Applicable income tax expense 189 &#160; 14 Effective tax rate 21.4 &#160; &#160;% 22.6 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

Applicable income tax expense increased $175 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher income before income taxes. The increase was partially offset by a $14 million tax benefit recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2021 that primarily related to share-based compensation. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from 22.6% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in state income tax expense.

(b) Includes $37 and $39 as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, of residential mortgage loans previously sold to GNMA for which the Bancorp is deemed to have regained effective control over under ASC Topic 860, but did not exercise its option to repurchase. Refer to Note 14 for further information. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $809 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020. The increase from December 31, 2020 was the result of a $974 million, or 2%, increase in consumer loans, partially offset by a $165 million decrease in commercial loans and leases. 

Commercial loans and leases decreased $165 million from December 31, 2020 due to decreases in commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by increases in commercial construction loans and commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $730 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of paydowns on revolving lines of credit, partially offset by loans originated under the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program during the first quarter of 2021. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $119 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Commercial construction loans increased $383 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2020 as draws on existing commitments exceeded payoffs. Commercial leases increased $301 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in lease originations. 

Consumer loans increased $974 million from December 31, 2020 due to increases in residential mortgage loans, indirect secured consumer loans and other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and credit card. Residential mortgage loans increased $780 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp purchased government-guaranteed loans in forbearance programs and also repurchased certain loans from GNMA that were in forbearance programs. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $683 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of loan production exceeding payoffs. Other consumer loans increased $76 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the purchase of a portfolio of point-of-sale loans. Home equity decreased $368 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Credit card decreased $197 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to seasonal paydowns on year-end balances as well as continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including accelerated paydown activity driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus during the first quarter of 2021.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $1.5 billion, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a $3.1 billion, or 8%, increase in average consumer loans, partially offset by a $1.6 billion, or 2%, decrease in average commercial loans and leases. 

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial leases, partially offset by an increase in average commercial construction loans. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $2.0 billion, or 4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by continued paydowns on revolving lines of credit, partially offset by the PPP loans originated since March of 2020. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $486 million, or 4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average commercial leases decreased $71 million, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of payoffs exceeding originations. Average commercial construction loans increased $907 million, or 18%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as draws on existing commitments exceeded payoffs. 

Average consumer loans increased $3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average residential mortgage loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in average home equity and average credit card. Average residential mortgage loans increased $2.4 billion, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp purchased government-guaranteed loans in forbearance programs and also repurchased certain loans from GNMA that were in forbearance programs, partially offset by higher runoff due to payoffs exceeding loan originations. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.1 billion, or 18%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to loan production exceeding payoffs. Average other consumer loans increased $199 million, or 7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of purchases of portfolios of point-of-sale loans. Average home equity decreased $997 million, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average credit card decreased $619 million, or 25%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by higher paydowns which were affected by the amount of fiscal stimulus. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $38.6 billion and $38.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 4.6 years at March 31, 2021 compared to 4.4 years at December 31, 2020. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At March 31, 2021, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount in below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Bancorp recognized $7 million of impairment losses on its 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities gains (losses), net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related. 

At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position for both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities: 

TABLE 16: Components of Investment Securities As of ($ in millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Available-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost basis): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities $ 74 &#160; 74 Obligations of states and political subdivisions securities 18 &#160; 17 Mortgage-backed securities: Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 11,536 &#160; 11,147 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 17,357 &#160; 16,745 Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 3,195 &#160; 3,323 Asset-backed securities and other debt securities 3,262 &#160; 3,152 Other securities (a)

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings of $36, $483 and $2, respectively, at March 31, 2021 and $40, $482 and $2, respectively, at December 31, 2020, that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities increased $981 million from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by a decrease in non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 19% of total interest-earning assets at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 5.9 years at March 31, 2021 compared to 5.7 years at December 31, 2020. In addition, at March 31, 2021, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.97% compared to 3.05% at December 31, 2020. 

Information presented in Table 17 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $1.6 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were $34.2 billion and $33.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase of $788 million from December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to deposit growth during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 77% and 74% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(a) Includes $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion of institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Core deposits increased $3.6 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits. Transaction deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in demand deposits and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest checking deposits. Demand deposits increased $3.7 billion, or 6%, primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to increased liquidity levels in the form of excess cash balances driven by the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as balance migration from interest checking deposits during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Savings deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 10%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer spending. Interest checking deposits decreased $1.7 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account as well as the aforementioned balance migration into demand deposits during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Other time deposits decreased $264 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $242 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued since December 31, 2020. 

The following table presents the components of average deposits for the three months ended:

(a) Includes $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion of average institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $33.7 billion, or 27%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase of $35.7 billion, or 30%, in average transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 billion, or 40%, in average other time deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven primarily by increases in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits, average savings deposits and average money market deposits. Average demand deposits increased $22.8 billion, or 64%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per commercial customer account due to the previously mentioned increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment in the form of excess cash balances driven by the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as balance migration from interest checking deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $5.3 billion, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account due to the

previously mentioned increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment in the form of excess cash balances driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus partially offset by the aforementioned balance migration into demand deposits. Average savings deposits increased $4.2 billion, or 29%, and average money market deposits increased $3.5 billion, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as well as decreased consumer spending. Average other time deposits decreased primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $1.3 billion, or 40%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to maturities and lower offering rates on certificates greater than $100,000. Average other deposits decreased $257 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average Eurodollar trade deposits. 

Contractual maturities 

The contractual maturities of certificates $100,000 and over as of March 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 14% at March 31, 2021 compared to 15% at December 31, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings: 

TABLE 22: Components of Borrowings As of ($ in millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Federal funds purchased $ 302 &#160; 300 Other short-term borrowings 1,106 &#160; 1,192 Long-term debt 14,743 &#160; 14,973 Total borrowings $ 16,151 &#160; 16,465 

Total borrowings decreased $314 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in long-term debt and other short-term borrowings. Long-term debt decreased $230 million from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by $145 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $111 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Other short-term borrowings decreased $86 million from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of decreased short-term funding needs given continued core deposit growth. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table summarizes components of average borrowings for the three months ended: 

TABLE 23: Components of Average Borrowings ($ in millions) March 31, 2021 March 31, 2020 Federal funds purchased $ 324 &#160; 654 Other short-term borrowings 1,209 &#160; 1,750 Long-term debt 14,849 &#160; 15,816 Total average borrowings $ 16,382 &#160; 18,220 

Total average borrowings decreased $1.8 billion, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in average long-term debt, average other short-term borrowings and average federal funds purchased. Average long-term debt decreased $967 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the maturity of $1.1 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes, the maturity of $750 million of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes, the maturity of $300 million of unsecured senior floating-rate bank notes and $518 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since March of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $1.25 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes in the second quarter of 2020. Average other short-term borrowings decreased $541 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreased short-term funding needs given strong core deposit growth. Average federal funds purchased decreased $330 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreased short-term funding needs given strong core deposit growth. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets have declined since December 31, 2020 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also modestly declined due to lower interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments improved while deposit-providing business segments were negatively impacted during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:
