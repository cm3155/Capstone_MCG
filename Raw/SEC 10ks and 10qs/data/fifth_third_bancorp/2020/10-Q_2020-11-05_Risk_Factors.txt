 Risk Factors (Item 1A) 

The following is a change to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Registrant&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated by the Registrant&#8217;s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q: 

Fifth Third could suffer from unauthorized use of intellectual property 

Fifth Third develops for itself, and licenses from others, intellectual property for use in conducting its business. This intellectual property has been, and may be, subject to misappropriation or infringement by third parties as well as claims that Fifth Third&#8217;s use of certain technology or other intellectual property infringes on rights owned by others. Fifth Third has been, and may be, subject to disputes and/or litigation concerning these claims and could be held responsible for significant damages covering past activities and substantial fees to continue to engage in these activities in the future. Fifth Third may also be unable to acquire rights to use certain intellectual property that is important for its business and may be unable to effectively engage in critical business activities. If Fifth Third is unable to protect or acquire rights to use intellectual property it owns or licenses it may lose certain competitive advantages, incur expenses and/or lose revenue and may suffer harm to its business results and financial condition.
