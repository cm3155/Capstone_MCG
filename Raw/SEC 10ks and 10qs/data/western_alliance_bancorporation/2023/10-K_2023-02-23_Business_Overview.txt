&#8226; Western Finance Company purchases and originates equipment finance leases and provides mortgage banking services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AmeriHome. 

&#8226; DST provides digital payments services for the class action legal industry. 

Market Segments 

The Company's reportable segments are aggregated with a focus on products and services offered and consist of three reportable segments: 

&#8226; Commercial: provides commercial banking and treasury management products and services to small and middle-market businesses, specialized banking services to sophisticated commercial institutions and investors within niche industries, as well as financial services to the real estate industry. 

&#8226; Consumer Related: offers both commercial banking services to enterprises in consumer-related sectors and consumer banking services, such as residential mortgage banking and beginning on January 25, 2022, includes the financial results of DST, which provides digital payment services for the class action legal industry. 

&#8226; Corporate &#38; Other: consists of the Company's investment portfolio, Corporate borrowings and other related items, income and expense items not allocated to other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations. 

Loan and deposit accounts are typically assigned directly to the segments where these products are originated and/or serviced. Equity capital is assigned to each segment based primarily on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities. Any excess equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Net interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segments to the extent that the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. Net income amounts for each reportable segment are further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, number of transactions processed for loans and deposits, and average loan and deposit balances. Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are adjusted in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Lending Activities 

General 

The Company&#8217;s lending has focused primarily on meeting the needs of business customers. Through WAB and its banking divisions and operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of lending products to customers, including the loan types discussed below. 

Commercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial loans are a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio, representing 40% and 47% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans include working capital lines of credit, loans to technology companies, inventory and accounts receivable lines, mortgage warehouse lines, and other commercial loans. Equipment loans and leases, tax-exempt municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations are also categorized as commercial and industrial loans. 

CRE: Loans to fund the purchase or refinancing of CRE for investors (non-owner occupied) or owner occupants are a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. Approximately 16% and 13% of the Company's CRE investor portfolio consisted of office loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These office loans are primarily shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects and are geographically well diversified, with the vast majority located in midtown or suburban locations. At the time of origination, these loans have an initial loan-to-value ratio of less than 55% and a weighted average loan-to-cost of less than 60%. The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. In addition, conservative underwriting focused on loan-to-cost lending with significant up-front sponsor cash equity, re-appraisal rights by the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service and debt yield covenants mitigates asset-type credit risk and provides for ongoing sponsor support of and commitment to projects. 

Substantially all of the Company's remaining CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75%. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 16% and 23% of the Company's CRE loans were owner occupied. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property. 

Construction and Land Development: Construction and land development loans include single family and multi-family residential projects, industrial/warehouse properties, office buildings, retail centers, medical office facilities, and residential lot developments. These loans are primarily originated to experienced local and national developers with whom the Company has a satisfactory lending history. An analysis of each construction project is performed as part of the underwriting process to determine whether the type of property, location, construction costs, and contingency funds are appropriate and adequate. Loans to finance commercial raw land are primarily to borrowers who plan to initiate active development of the property within two years. 

Residential: The Company executes flow and bulk residential loan purchases that meet the Company's goals and underwriting criteria through its residential mortgage acquisition program. These loan purchases consist of both conforming and non-conforming loans. Non-conforming loan purchases are considered to be high quality as the borrowers have high FICO scores and the loans generally have low loan-to-values. 

Consumer: Limited types of consumer loans are offered to meet customer demand and to respond to community needs. Examples of these consumer loans include home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, personal lines of credit, and loans to individuals for investment purposes. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company's HFI loan portfolio totaled $51.9 billion, or approximately 77% of total assets. The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's HFI loan portfolio: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent (dollars in millions) Commercial and industrial $ 20,710 &#160; 39.9 &#160; % $ 18,297 46.8 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 9,319 &#160; 18.0 &#160; 6,526 16.7 Commercial real estate - owner occupied 1,818 &#160; 3.5 &#160; 1,898 4.9 Construction and land development 4,013 &#160; 7.7 &#160; 3,023 7.7 Residential real estate 15,928 &#160; 30.7 &#160; 9,282 23.8 Consumer 74 &#160; 0.2 &#160; 49 0.1 Loans HFI, net of deferred loan fees and costs $ 51,862 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 39,075 100.0 % Allowance for credit losses (310) (252) Net loans HFI $ 51,552 &#160; $ 38,823 ##TABLE_END

For additional information concerning loans, see "Note 5. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses" in Item 8 or "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition &#8211; Loans" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

The Company adheres to a specific set of credit standards that are intended to ensure appropriate management of credit risk. Furthermore, the Bank's senior management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with such standards. 

Loan originations are subject to a process that includes the credit evaluation of borrowers, utilizing established lending limits, analysis of collateral, and procedures for continual monitoring and identification of credit deterioration. Loan officers actively monitor their individual credit relationships in order to report suspected risks and potential downgrades as early as possible. The BOD approves all material changes to loan policy, as well as lending limit authorities. The Bank's lending policies generally incorporate consistent underwriting standards across all geographic regions in which the Bank operates, customized as necessary to conform to state law and local market conditions. The Bank's credit culture emphasizes timely identification of troubled credits to allow management to take prompt corrective action, when necessary. 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 

The Company's loan approval procedures are executed through a tiered loan limit authorization process, which is structured as follows: 

&#8226; Individual Credit Authorities. The credit approval levels for individual divisional and senior credit officers are set by policy and certain credit administration officers' approval authorities are established on a delegated basis. 

&#8226; Management Loan Committees. Credits in excess of individual divisional or senior credit officer approval authority are submitted to the appropriate divisional or NBL loan committee. The divisional committees consist of members of the Bank's senior management team of each division and the NBL loan committees consist of the Bank's divisional or senior credit officers. 

&#8226; Credit Administration. Credits in excess of the divisional or NBL loan committee approval authority require the additional approval of the Bank's CCO and any credits in excess of the CCO's individual approval authority are submitted to the WAB SLC. In addition, the SLC reviews all other loan approvals to any one new borrower in excess of established thresholds. The SLC is chaired by the WAB CCO and includes the Company&#8217;s CEO. 

Loans to One Borrower. In addition to the limits set forth above, subject to certain exceptions, state banking laws generally limit the amount of funds that a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Arizona law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank generally may not exceed 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Arizona law does not specifically require aggregation of loans to affiliated entities in determining compliance with the lending limit. As a matter of longstanding practice, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions uses the same aggregation analysis as applied to national banks by the OCC. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk. The Company's lending policies also establish customer and product concentration limits for its HFI and HFS loan portfolios, which are based on outstanding amounts, to control single customer and product exposures. The Company's lending policies have several different measures to limit concentration exposures. Set forth below are the primary segmentation limits and actual measures based on outstanding amounts as of December 31, 2022: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Percent of Tier 1 Capital and ACL &#160; Policy Limit Actual Loans HFI CRE 295 % 193 % Commercial and industrial 485 359 Construction and land development 85 70 Residential real estate 300 276 Consumer 10 1 Loans HFS Residential real estate 215 21 ##TABLE_END

Asset Quality 

General 

To measure asset quality, the Company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories. The first five are considered satisfactory "pass" ratings. The other four "non-pass" grades range from a &#8220;Special mention&#8221; category to a &#8220;Loss&#8221; category and are consistent with the grading systems used by federal banking regulators. All loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made and formally reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Company's loan grade certification process to identify loans that may be exhibiting early-warning signs of credit stress and determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted. In addition, the grading of the Company's loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by its internal Loan Review Department. 

Collection Procedure 

Bank personnel are responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating, including, but not limited to, past-dues, overdrafts, and loan agreement covenant defaults. If a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan, Bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment. Contact is generally made within 15 business days after the payment becomes past due. The Bank also maintains a special assets department, which generally services and collects loans rated Substandard or worse. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged-off. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest (that are not government guaranteed), non-accrual and TDR loans, and repossessed assets, including OREO. In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status when the Company determines that ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, collateral value, and collection efforts. In addition, the Company considers all loans rated Substandard or lower to be experiencing financial difficulty. A TDR loan is a loan for which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. Other repossessed assets result from loans where the Company has received title or physical possession of the borrower&#8217;s assets. The Company generally re-appraises OREO and collateral dependent non-residential loans with balances greater than $0.5 million every 12 months. The total net realized and unrealized gains and losses of repossessed and other assets was not significant during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, losses may be experienced in future periods. 

Criticized Assets 

Federal bank regulators require banks to classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with their examinations of the Bank, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, re-classify them. A loan grade of "Special Mention" from the Company's internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loan grades of "Substandard," "Doubtful," and "Loss" are utilized to identify actual problem assets. 

The following describes the potential and actual problem assets using the Company's internal loan grading system definitions: 

&#8226; "Special Mention" (Grade 6): Generally these are assets that possess potential weaknesses that warrant management's close attention. These loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt to equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a &#8220;problem loan&#8221; where risk of loss may be apparent. Loans in this category are usually performing as agreed, although there may be non-compliance with financial covenants. 

&#8226; &#8220;Substandard&#8221; (Grade 7): These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected. All loans 90 days or more past due and all loans on non-accrual status are considered at least "Substandard," unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise. 

&#8226; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; (Grade 8): These assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "Substandard" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable, but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset (for example, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans), classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined. 

&#8226; &#8220;Loss&#8221; (Grade 9): These assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset, even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios as well as off-balance sheet credit exposures. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the ACL and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the ACL. The ACL on funded loans and investment securities are presented as a reduction to the respective asset balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ACL on unfunded loan commitments is classified in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For a detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s methodology see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Investment Activities 

The Company has an investment policy, which is approved by the BOD on an annual basis. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements of the Bank and holding company, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company's interest rate risk management. The Bank&#8217;s ALCO is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance with established policies. The CFO and Treasurer have the authority to purchase and sell securities within specified guidelines. All investment transactions for the Bank and for the holding company were reviewed by the ALCO and BOD. 

The Company's investment policy limits new securities purchases to certain eligible investment types and, in the aggregate, are further subject to the following quantitative limits of the Bank: 

##TABLE_START Securities Category Basis Limit Policy Limit Actual Collateralized loan obligations Total assets 5.0 % 4.1 % Commercial mortgage-backed securities Total assets 1.0 &#8212; Corporate debt securities Total assets 2.5 0.6 Investment grade corporate bond mutual funds Tier 1 capital 5.0 &#8212; Preferred stock Common equity tier 1 10.0 2.0 Tax-exempt low income housing development bonds Total capital 30.0 17.4 Tax-exempt municipal securities Total assets 5.0 1.4 ##TABLE_END

The Company's policies also govern the use of derivatives, and provide that the Company prudently use derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations as a risk management tool to reduce the overall exposure to interest rate risk, and not for speculative purposes. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio includes debt and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as AFS or HTM pursuant to ASC Topic 320, Investments and ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments . Equity securities are reported at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 321, Equity Securities . For further discussion of significant accounting policies related to the Company's investment securities portfolio refer to "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company's investment securities portfolio totals $8.5 billion, representing approximately 13% of the Company's total assets, with a significant portion of the portfolio invested in AAA/AA+ rated securities. The average duration, which is a measure of the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's debt securities portfolio, is 5.5 years as of December 31, 2022. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent (dollars in millions) Debt securities CLO $ 2,706 &#160; 31.7 &#160; % $ 926 12.4 % Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 97 &#160; 1.1 &#160; 69 1.0 Corporate debt securities 390 &#160; 4.6 &#160; 383 5.1 Private label residential MBS 1,397 &#160; 16.3 &#160; 1,725 23.1 Residential MBS issued by GSEs 1,740 &#160; 20.4 &#160; 1,993 26.8 Tax-exempt 1,982 &#160; 23.2 &#160; 2,105 28.2 U.S. treasury securities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 0.2 Other 69 &#160; 0.8 &#160; 82 1.1 Total debt securities $ 8,381 &#160; 98.1 &#160; % $ 7,296 97.9 % Equity securities Common stock $ 3 &#160; 0.0 &#160; % $ &#8212; &#8212; % CRA investments 49 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 45 0.6 Preferred stock 108 &#160; 1.3 &#160; 114 1.5 Total equity securities $ 160 &#160; 1.9 &#160; % $ 159 2.1 % Total investment securities $ 8,541 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 7,455 100.0 % ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had investments in BOLI of $182 million and $180 million, respectively. BOLI is used to help offset employee benefit costs. For additional information concerning investments, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Financial Condition &#8211; Investments&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Deposit Products 

The Company offers a variety of deposit products, including demand deposits, checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and other types of deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposit. The Company has historically focused on growing its lower cost core customer deposits. As of December 31, 2022, the deposit portfolio was comprised of 37% non-interest-bearing deposits and 63% interest-bearing deposits. 

The competition for deposits in the Company's markets is strong. The Company has historically been successful in attracting and retaining deposits due to several factors, including its: 

&#8226; knowledgeable and empowered bankers committed to providing personalized and responsive service that translates into long lasting relationships; 

&#8226; broad selection of cash management services offered; and 

&#8226; incentives to employees for business development and retention. 

Deposit balances are generally influenced by national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, competitiveness of offered rates, perceived stability of financial institutions, and competition. In order to attract and retain deposits, the Company relies on providing quality service and introducing new products and services that meet the needs of its customers. 

The Bank's deposit rates are determined through an internal oversight process under the direction of its ALCO. The Bank considers a number of factors when determining deposit rates, including: 

&#8226; current and projected national and local economic conditions and the outlook for interest rates; 

&#8226; competition from other institutions; 

&#8226; loan and deposit positions and forecasts, including any concentrations in either; and 

&#8226; alternative borrowing costs from the FHLB or other sources. 

The following table shows the Company's deposit composition: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent (in millions) Non-interest-bearing demand deposits $ 19,691 &#160; 36.7 &#160; % $ 21,353 44.9 % Interest-bearing transaction accounts 9,507 &#160; 17.7 &#160; 6,924 14.5 Savings and money market accounts 19,397 &#160; 36.2 &#160; 17,279 36.3 Time certificates of deposit ($250,000 or more) 3,815 &#160; 7.1 &#160; 523 1.1 Other time deposits 1,234 &#160; 2.3 &#160; 1,533 3.2 Total deposits $ 53,644 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 47,612 100.0 % ##TABLE_END

Although the Company does not pay interest to depositors of non-interest-bearing accounts, earnings credits and referral fees are awarded to some account holders, which offset charges incurred by account holders for other services. Earnings credits and referral fees earned in excess of charges incurred by account holders are recorded in deposit costs as part of non-interest expense and fluctuate as a result of eligible deposit balances and rates on these deposit balances. 

In addition to the Company's deposit base, it has access to other sources of funding, including FHLB and FRB advances, Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and secured and unsecured lines of credit with other financial institutions. Previously, the Company has also accessed the capital markets through trust preferred, credit linked note, subordinated debt, and Senior Note offerings. For additional information concerning the Company's deposits, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8211; Deposits&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Other Financial Products and Services 

In addition to traditional commercial banking activities, the Company offers other financial services to its customers, including internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment and presentment, 24/7 funds transfer and other digital payment offerings, lock box services, courier, and cash management services. 

Customer, Product, and Geographic Concentrations 

Commercial and industrial loans make up 40% and 47% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, 29% of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was represented by CRE and construction and land development loans. The Company&#8217;s CRE business is concentrated primarily in the Phoenix, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Reno, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Tucson metropolitan areas. Consequently, the Company is dependent on the trends of these regional economies. 

The Company is not dependent upon any single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its reportable segments have customer relationships that individually account for 10% or more of consolidated or segment revenues. No material portion of the Company&#8217;s business is seasonal. 

Competition 

The financial services industry is highly competitive and has been significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other banks, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial technology firms, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the interest rates on those products and the terms on which they are offered to customers. In addition, many of the Company's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization and are able to offer a broader range of financial services than the Company can offer. Technological innovation and capabilities, including changes in product delivery systems and web-based tools, also continue to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets and larger competitors may be able to allocate more resources to these technology initiatives. 

Human Capital Resources 

The Company&#8217;s culture is defined by its corporate values of integrity, creativity, teamwork, passion, and excellence. People, Performance, and Possibilities capture the Company's defining values and behaviors that shape our unique culture and how we do business. People are the foundation of the Company and the Company invests in their success by providing expanded opportunities to attract and retain its people. Our people are committed to our clients&#8217; success and, by putting clients first, we create strong shareholder performance. This leads to tremendous possibilities to fuel client growth and support the Company&#8217;s communities. 

The Company is deeply committed to giving back to the communities where it does business and strives to help low-to-moderate income geographies become healthier and more sustainable communities. Employees are encouraged to dedicate their time and expertise to charitable and civic organizations they are passionate about. In total, employees have volunteered more than 25,000 hours since 2020. The Company is also committed to providing financial support for education, affordable housing, and community development lending and investments. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 3,365 full-time equivalent employees in its branches and loan production offices across the United States, an increase of 7% from December 31, 2021 due to continued organic growth. The Company&#8217;s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 

The Company is committed to improving workforce diversity at all levels of the organization and to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. In 2022, the Company continued to make progress towards enhancing its ability to attract and retain a diverse population of employees. The Company has built relationships with community and educational institutions to strengthen its pipelines of talent in underrepresented communities. The Company has established an executive-led Opportunity Council, which guides and sponsors DEI initiatives, provides access to leadership, and evaluates organizational and best practice DEI strategies. Overall, the Opportunity Council is focused on accelerating DEI activities and results. One aspect of this work is the active support of Business Resource Groups focused on the career advancement of diverse groups within the Company, such as women, minority groups, and LGBTQIA+ employees. These groups foster opportunities to engage in programs, network with peers, and connect with Bank leadership. 

The Company employs a diverse workforce that reflects its communities, which is shown in the Company's ethnic and gender diversity metrics presented in the table below: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (as a percentage of total employees) Employees belonging to an ethnic minority group 43 &#160; % 44 % 38 % Female employees 52 &#160; 55 58 ##TABLE_END

Of the employees that are women, 44% occupy roles that involve supervising and managing other employees as of December 31, 2022, compared to 47% in the prior year. 

The below table presents the ethnic and gender diversity metrics for the Company's BOD: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 (as a percentage of total directors) Directors belonging to an ethnic minority group 21 &#160; % 15 % Female directors 21 &#160; 15 ##TABLE_END

The Company remains committed to increasing the share of women and minority groups in the ranks of its leadership and BOD. 

Recruiting, Retention, and Talent Development 

The Company recognizes that its success is highly dependent on its ability to attract, retain and develop employees. To foster this development, the Company has created three early talent identification programs, a college internship program, the CBDP, and iLead, the goal of each of which is to enhance management&#8217;s ability to promote pathways for growth of future leaders. Campus recruitment initiatives and partnerships also help expand the Company&#8217;s pipeline of talent. Within the internship program, college students and recent graduates are paired with leaders across the Company to create a valuable, immersive experience, with an objective of retaining promising interns and creating a pipeline for the CBDP or other roles. The CBDP is an 18-month, on-the-job development program to train successful credit analysts that offers progressive assignments, mentoring, opportunities to learn the business and various aspects of leadership, with the objective of developing future leaders of the Company. The iLead Program is an 18-month program for recent MBA graduates, designed to accelerate the development of high potential mid-career talent in sales or corporate career paths. Additionally, the Company has expanded its sales training and mentoring efforts to foster internal development within its commercial lending teams. 

As a growing company, recruiting new talent to the organization is key to the Company&#8217;s success and part of that objective includes building a diverse workforce that is representative of the communities that the Company serves. In 2022, 48% of WAB&#8217;s open positions were filled by external candidates belonging to an ethnic minority group and 74% of promotions were awarded to ethnically diverse or female employees. The Company has made a commitment to growing the share of its employee population from diverse communities and has experienced success in recent years, although the Company believes there is still an opportunity for additional advancement in this area. 

Retaining employees who have been key contributors to the Company's success story remains an important objective. The table below presents the Company's overall employee turnover rate: 

##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2022 (1) 2021 2020 Turnover Rate 17 &#160; % 19 % 13 % ##TABLE_END

(1) Excludes the impact of reductions in workforce during the period. 

For 2022 compared to 2021, the turnover rate decreased from 19% to 17%. During 2022, the Company&#8217;s residential mortgage banking workforce was reduced to align with lower residential mortgage loan production volumes compared to 2021, which was driven by rising interest rates throughout 2022. This reduction represented 7% of the Company&#8217;s total 2021 employees. 

For 2021, the Company&#8217;s turnover rate was impacted by the Great Resignation, which refers to the trend in which employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in record numbers, with turnover rates highest among mid-career employees. In both 2022 and 2021, the Company's turnover rate was highest among employees in the Under 30 age group, as shown in the table below. 

##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, Turnover Rate by Age Group 2022 2021 Under 30 27 &#160; % 27 % Between 30-50 15 &#160; 19 Over 50 15 &#160; 16 ##TABLE_END

The Company also offers a variety of resources to help its employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development programs and workshops, mentoring programs, and internal webinars that feature speakers from across the Company, sharing information about and success in their business line, division, or functional area. The Company encourages its employees to take an active role in their career and through the annual performance management process, employees are able to identify individual development goals and create an action plan to achieve these goals. 

With the understanding that bias is a larger societal issue, the Company offers training to create awareness and understanding of everyday biases and micro-behaviors, and helps individuals to implement solutions to create a more inclusive workplace. This training is required for all employees and additional, focused trainings are required for all managers, including one specifically promoting inclusion.
