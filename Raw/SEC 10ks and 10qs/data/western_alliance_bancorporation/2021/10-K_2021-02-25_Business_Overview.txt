##TABLE_END

WAB also has the following significant wholly-owned subsidiaries: 

&#8226; Western Alliance Business Trust holds certain investment securities, municipal and non-profit loans, and leases. 

&#8226; WA PWI holds certain limited partnerships invested primarily in low income housing tax credits and small business investment corporations. 

&#8226; BW Real Estate, Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust and holds certain real estate loans and related securities. 

&#8226; Helios Prime, Inc. holds certain equity interests in renewable energy tax credit transactions. 

Market Segments 

The Company has made changes to its reportable segments, which have been reflected in the Company's operating segment results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company's reportable segments are aggregated with a focus on products and services offered and consist of three reportable segments: 

&#8226; Commercial segment: provides commercial banking and treasury management products and services to small and middle-market businesses, specialized banking services to sophisticated commercial institutions and investors within niche industries, as well as financial services to the real estate industry. 

&#8226; Consumer Related segment: offers both commercial banking services to enterprises in consumer-related sectors and consumer banking services, such as residential mortgage banking. 

&#8226; Corporate &#38; Other segment: consists of the Company's investment portfolio, Corporate borrowings and other related items, income and expense items not allocated to our other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations. 

Loan and deposit accounts are typically assigned directly to the segments where these products are originated and/or serviced. Equity capital is assigned to each segment based on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities. Any excess equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Net interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segments to the extent that the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. Net income amounts for each reportable segment are further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, number of transactions processed for loans and deposits, and average loan and deposit balances. Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are adjusted in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Lending Activities 

General 

Through WAB and its banking divisions and operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of financial services to customers, including CRE loans, construction and land development loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. The Company&#8217;s lending has focused primarily on meeting the needs of business customers. 

Commercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial loans are a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio and include working capital lines of credit, inventory and accounts receivable lines, mortgage warehouse lines, equipment loans and leases, and other commercial loans. Loans to technology companies, tax-exempt municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations are also categorized as commercial and industrial loans. 

CRE: Loans to fund the purchase or refinancing of CRE for investors (non-owner occupied) or owner occupants are a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 28% and 31% of the Company's CRE loans were owner occupied. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property. 

Construction and Land Development: Construction and land development loans include single family and multi-family residential projects, industrial/warehouse properties, office buildings, retail centers, medical office facilities, and residential lot developments. These loans are primarily originated to experienced local developers with whom the Company has a satisfactory lending history. An analysis of each construction project is performed as part of the underwriting process to determine whether the type of property, location, construction costs, and contingency funds are appropriate and adequate. Loans to finance commercial raw land are primarily to borrowers who plan to initiate active development of the property within two years. 

Residential: The Company has a residential mortgage acquisition program, in which it partners with strategic third parties to execute flow and bulk residential loan purchases that meet the Company's goals and underwriting criteria. These loan purchases consist of both conforming and non-conforming loans. Non-conforming loan purchases are considered to be high quality as the borrowers have high FICO scores and the loans generally have low loan-to-values. 

Consumer: Limited types of consumer loans are offered to meet customer demand and to respond to community needs. Examples of these consumer loans include home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, personal lines of credit, and loans to individuals for investment purposes. 

At December 31, 2020, the Company's loan portfolio totaled $27.1 billion, or approximately 74% of total assets. The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of the periods presented: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2020 2019 Amount Percent Amount Percent (dollars in millions) Commercial and industrial $ 14,324.4 &#160; 52.9 &#160; % $ 9,382.0 44.5 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 5,654.7 &#160; 20.9 &#160; 5,245.6 24.8 Commercial real estate - owner occupied 2,156.8 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 2,316.9 11.0 Construction and land development 2,431.3 &#160; 9.0 &#160; 1,952.2 9.2 Residential real estate 2,434.6 &#160; 9.0 &#160; 2,147.7 10.2 Consumer 51.2 &#160; 0.2 &#160; 57.1 0.3 Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs $ 27,053.0 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 21,101.5 100.0 % Allowance for credit losses (278.9) (167.8) Total loans HFI $ 26,774.1 &#160; $ 20,933.7 ##TABLE_END

For additional information concerning loans, see "Note 3. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses" of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein or "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition &#8211; Loans" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

The Company adheres to a specific set of credit standards that are intended to ensure appropriate management of credit risk. Furthermore, the Bank's senior management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with such standards. 

Loan originations are subject to a process that includes the credit evaluation of borrowers, utilizing established lending limits, analysis of collateral, and procedures for continual monitoring and identification of credit deterioration. Loan officers actively monitor their individual credit relationships in order to report suspected risks and potential downgrades as early as possible. The BOD approves all material changes to loan policy, as well as lending limit authorities. The Bank's lending policies generally incorporate consistent underwriting standards across all geographic regions in which the Bank operates, customized as necessary to conform to state law and local market conditions. The Bank's credit culture emphasizes timely identification of troubled credits to allow management to take prompt corrective action, when necessary. 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 

The Company's loan approval procedures are executed through a tiered loan limit authorization process, which is structured as follows: 

&#8226; Individual Credit Authorities. The credit approval levels for individual divisional and senior credit officers are set by policy and certain credit administration officers' approval authorities are established on a delegated basis. 

&#8226; Management Loan Committees. Credits in excess of individual divisional or senior credit officer approval authority are submitted to the appropriate divisional or NBL loan committee. The divisional committees consist of members of the Bank's senior management team of each division and the NBL loan committees consist of the Bank's divisional or senior credit officers. 

&#8226; Credit Administration. Credits in excess of the divisional or NBL loan committee approval authority require the additional approval of the Bank's CCO and any credits in excess of the CCO's individual approval authority are submitted to the WAB SLC. In addition, the SLC reviews all other loan approvals to any one new borrower in excess of established thresholds. The SLC is chaired by the WAB CCO and includes the Company&#8217;s CEO. 

Loans to One Borrower. In addition to the limits set forth above, subject to certain exceptions, state banking laws generally limit the amount of funds that a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Arizona law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank generally may not exceed 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Arizona law does not specifically require aggregation of loans to affiliated entities in determining compliance with the lending limit. As a matter of longstanding practice, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions uses the same aggregation analysis as applied to national banks by the OCC. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk. The Company's lending policies also establish customer and product concentration limits, which are based on commitment amounts, to control single customer and product exposures. The Company's lending policies have several different measures to limit concentration exposures. Set forth below are the primary segmentation limits and actual measures as of December 31, 2020: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Percent of Total Capital &#160; Policy Limit Actual CRE 325 % 202 % Commercial and industrial 400 370 Construction and land development 85 63 Residential real estate 150 63 Consumer 5 1 ##TABLE_END

Asset Quality 

General 

To measure asset quality, the Company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories. The first five are considered satisfactory "pass" ratings. The other four "non-pass" grades range from a &#8220;Special mention&#8221; category to a &#8220;Loss&#8221; category and are consistent with the grading systems used by federal banking regulators. All loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made and formally reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Company's loan grade certification process to determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted. In addition, the grading of the Company's loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by its internal Loan Review Department. 

Collection Procedure 

If a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan, Bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment. Contacts generally are made within 15 business days after the payment becomes past due. The Bank maintains regional Special Assets Departments, which generally service and collect loans rated Substandard or worse. Each division is responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating, including, but not limited to, past-dues, overdrafts, and loan agreement covenant defaults. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged-off. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, non-accrual loans, TDR loans, and repossessed assets, including OREO. In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status when the Company determines that ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, collateral value, and collection efforts. A TDR loan is a loan for which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. Other repossessed assets result from loans where the Company has received title or physical possession of the borrower&#8217;s assets. The Company generally re-appraises OREO and collateral dependent impaired loans every 12 months. The total net realized and unrealized gains and losses of repossessed and other assets was not significant during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. However, losses may be experienced in future periods. 

Criticized Assets 

Federal bank regulators require banks to classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with their examinations of the Bank, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, re-classify them. A loan grade of "Special Mention" from the Company's internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loan grades of "Substandard," "Doubtful," and "Loss" are utilized to identify actual problem assets. 

The following describes the potential and actual problem assets using the Company's internal loan grading system definitions: 

&#8226; "Special Mention" (Grade 6): Generally these are assets that possess potential weaknesses that warrant management's close attention. These loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt to equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a &#8220;problem loan&#8221; where risk of loss may be apparent. Loans in this category are usually performing as agreed, although there may be non-compliance with financial covenants. 

&#8226; &#8220;Substandard&#8221; (Grade 7): These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected. All loans 90 days or more past due and all loans on non-accrual status are considered at least "Substandard," unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise. 

&#8226; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; (Grade 8): These assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "Substandard" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable, but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset (for example, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans), classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined. 

&#8226; &#8220;Loss&#8221; (Grade 9): These assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset, even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and, upon the adoption of CECL, includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios as well as off-balance sheet credit exposures. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses on funded loans and investment securities are presented as a reduction to the respective asset balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For a detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s methodology see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Investment Activities 

The Company has an investment policy, which was approved by the BOD. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements of the Bank and holding company, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company's interest rate risk management. The Bank&#8217;s ALCO is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance with established policies. The CFO and Treasurer have the authority to purchase and sell securities within specified guidelines. All investment transactions for the Bank and for the holding company were reviewed by the ALCO and BOD. 

The Company's investment policy limits new securities purchases to certain eligible investment types and, in the aggregate, are further subject to the following quantitative limits of the Bank: 

##TABLE_START Securities Category Basis Limit Percentage or Dollar Limit Preferred stock Common equity tier 1 10.0 % Tax-exempt municipal securities Total assets 5.0 % Tax-exempt low income housing development bonds Total capital 30.0 % Investment grade corporate bond mutual funds Tier 1 capital 5.0 % Corporate debt holdings Total assets 2.5 % Commercial mortgage-backed securities Aggregate purchases $50.0 million Collateralized loan obligations Aggregate purchases $500.0 million ##TABLE_END

The Company's policies also govern the use of derivatives, and provide that the Company prudently use derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations as a risk management tool to reduce the overall exposure to interest rate risk, and not for speculative purposes. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company's investment securities portfolio includes debt and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as AFS or HTM pursuant to ASC Topic 320, Investments and ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments . Equity securities are reported at fair value in accordance with Topic 321, Equity Securities . For further discussion of significant accounting policies related to the Company's investment securities portfolio refer to "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company's investment securities portfolio totals $5.4 billion, representing approximately 15% of the Company's total assets, with the majority of the portfolio invested in AAA/AA+ rated securities. The average duration of the Company's investment securities is 6.4 years as of December 31, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of investment securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had investments in BOLI of $176.3 million and $174.0 million, respectively. BOLI is used to help offset employee benefit costs. For additional information concerning investments, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Financial Condition &#8211; Investments&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Deposit Products 

The Company offers a variety of deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and other types of deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposit. The Company has historically focused on growing its lower cost core customer deposits. As of December 31, 2020, the deposit portfolio was comprised of 42% non-interest-bearing deposits and 58% interest-bearing deposits. 

The competition for deposits in the Company's markets is strong. The Company has historically been successful in attracting and retaining deposits due to several factors, including its: 

&#8226; knowledgeable and empowered bankers committed to providing personalized and responsive service that translates into long lasting relationships; 

&#8226; broad selection of cash management services offered; and 

&#8226; incentives to employees for business development and retention. 

Deposit balances are generally influenced by national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, competitiveness of the Company's offered rates, perceived stability of financial institutions, and competition. In order to attract and retain deposits, the Company relies on providing quality service and introducing new products and services that meet the needs of its customers. 

The Bank's deposit rates are determined through an internal oversight process under the direction of its ALCO. The Bank considers a number of factors when determining deposit rates, including: 

&#8226; current and projected national and local economic conditions and the outlook for interest rates; 

&#8226; local competition; 

&#8226; loan and deposit positions and forecasts, including any concentrations in either; and 

&#8226; rates charged on FHLB advances and other funding sources. 

The following table shows the Company's deposit composition: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2020 2019 Amount Percent Amount Percent (in millions) Non-interest-bearing demand deposits $ 13,463.3 &#160; 42.2 &#160; % $ 8,537.9 37.4 % Interest-bearing transaction accounts 4,396.4 &#160; 13.8 &#160; 2,760.9 12.1 Savings and money market accounts 12,413.4 &#160; 38.9 &#160; 9,120.8 40.0 Time certificates of deposit ($250,000 or more) 602.0 &#160; 1.9 &#160; 1,426.1 6.3 Other time deposits 1,055.4 &#160; 3.2 &#160; 950.8 4.2 Total deposits $ 31,930.5 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 22,796.5 100.0 % ##TABLE_END

Although the Company does not pay interest to depositors of non-interest-bearing accounts, earnings credits are awarded to some account holders, which offset charges incurred by account holders for other services. Earnings credits earned in excess of charges incurred by account holders are recorded in deposit costs as part of non-interest expense and fluctuate as a result of deposit balances eligible for earnings credits, along with the earnings credit rates on these deposit balances. 

In addition to the Company's deposit base, it has access to other sources of funding, including FHLB and FRB advances, Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and unsecured lines of credit with other financial institutions. Previously, the Company has also accessed the capital markets through trust preferred, subordinated debt, and Senior Note offerings. For additional information concerning the Company's deposits, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8211; Deposits&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Other Financial Products and Services 

In addition to traditional commercial banking activities, the Company offers other financial services to its customers, including internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment and presentment, lock box services, courier, and cash management services. 

Customer, Product, and Geographic Concentrations 

Approximately 38% and 45% of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was represented by CRE and construction and land development loans. The Company&#8217;s business is concentrated primarily in the Phoenix, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Reno, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Tucson metropolitan areas. Consequently, the Company is dependent on the trends of these regional economies. 

Although commercial and industrial loans make up approximately 53% and 44% of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the Company does not consider this to be a significant concentration risk as these loans are well diversified in terms of customers and product offerings. 

The Company is not dependent upon any single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its reportable segments have customer relationships that individually account for 10% or more of consolidated or segment revenues. No material portion of the Company&#8217;s business is seasonal. 

Competition 

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Many of the Company's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, offer a broader range of financial services than the Company can offer, and may have lower cost structures. 

This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of long-term changes in regulation that made mergers and geographic expansion easier, changes in technology and product delivery systems and web-based tools, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other banks, credit unions, brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial technology firms, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the interest rates on those products and the terms on which they are offered to customers. 

Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets. 

Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company. 

Human Capital Resources 

The Company&#8217;s culture is defined by its corporate values of integrity, creativity, teamwork, passion and excellence. People are the foundation of the Company and the Company invests in their success. Our people are committed to our clients&#8217; success and, by putting clients first, we create strong shareholder performance. This leads to tremendous possibilities to fuel client growth and support the Company&#8217;s communities, and in turn provide expanding opportunities to attract and retain its people. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 1,915 full-time equivalent employees in its branches and loan production offices across the United States, an increase of 4.4% from December 31, 2019 due to the Company&#8217;s growth. The Company&#8217;s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Diversity and Inclusion 

The Company is committed to improving workforce diversity at all levels of the organization. In 2020, the Company made progress towards enhancing its ability to attract and retain a diverse population of employees. The Company began building relationships with community and educational institutions to strengthen its pipelines of talent in underrepresented communities. The Company has established an executive-led Diversity &#38; Inclusion Opportunity Council, which guides and sponsors initiatives, sets goals designed to increase diversity of thought and access to leadership, evaluates organizational and best practice D&#38;I strategies, and creates subcommittees to activate goals. One aspect of this work is the active support of Business Resource Groups. Among the groups&#8217; activities are opportunities to engage in programs, network with peers, and connect with Bank leadership. Overall, the Opportunity Council is focused on accelerating D&#38;I activities and results. 

The Company employs a diverse population that is a reflection of its communities, with 38% of its employees belonging to a minority group. Nearly 58% of its employees are women, with women filling 50% of roles that involve supervising and managing other employees. The Company is committed to increasing the share of women and minority groups in the ranks of its senior leadership. 

Recruiting, Retention, and Talent Development 

The Company recognizes that its success is highly dependent on its ability to attract, retain and develop employees. To foster this development, the Company has created two early talent identification programs, a college internship program and Commercial Banking Development Program, each of which enhance management&#8217;s ability to hire outstanding people. Campus recruitment initiatives and partnerships also fuel the Company&#8217;s pipeline of talent. Within the internship program, college students and recent graduates are paired with leaders across the Company to create a valuable, immersive experience, with an objective of retaining the most promising interns and eventually bringing this talent into the Bank through the CBDP or other appropriate positions. The CBDP is an 18-month, on-the-job development program to train successful credit analysts that offers progressive assignments, mentoring, opportunities to learn the business and various aspects of leadership, with the objective of growing these individuals into future leaders of the Company. Additionally, the Company is expanding its sales training and mentoring efforts to foster internal development within its commercial lending teams. 

As a growing company, recruiting new talent to the organization is key to the Company&#8217;s success and part of that objective includes building a diverse workforce that is representative of the communities that the Company serves. The Company has made a commitment to growing the share of its employee population from diverse communities and has experienced some success in recent years, although the Company believes there is still an opportunity for additional advancement in this area. For example, through focused recruiting efforts, the Company was able to increase the share of 2020 hires who are Black or African American to 7.6%, higher than the Company's current Black or African American employee population of 5.8%. 

Retaining employees who have been key contributors to the Company's success story remains an important objective. The Company has achieved a multi-year decline in its turnover rate, falling to 12.5% for 2020, down 2.1% year-over-year, and down nearly 7% from 2017. An internal review of turnover rates of various employee categories, including ethnicity, gender, and age, reveals that turnover occurs at roughly the same rate as the group&#8217;s total representation. For example, White employees represent 62% of the Company's employee population and account for 61% of the Company's turnover. Similarly, Millennials and women represent 31% and 57% of the Company's employee population, respectively, and account for 31% and 51% of the turnover, respectively. The Company's turnover rate is highest among employees from the Builders (born 1900 to 1945) and Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964) generations as they reach retirement age in greater numbers. 

The Company also offers a variety of resources to help its employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development programs and workshops, mentoring programs, and internal webinars that feature speakers from across the Company, sharing information about their business line, division, or functional area. The Company encourages its employees to take an active role in their career and through the annual performance management process, employees are able to identify individual development goals and create an action plan to achieve these goals. 

With the understanding that bias is a larger societal issue, the Company offers training to create awareness and understanding of everyday biases and micro-behaviors, and helps individuals to implement solutions to create a more inclusive workplace. This training is required for all employees and additional, focused trainings are required for all managers, including one specifically promoting inclusion.
