Recent Banking Industry and Market Developments 

Banking Industry 

In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing a special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The assessment base is equal to an institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessment will be collected over an eight-quarter collection period, at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, with the first quarterly assessment period beginning on January 1, 2024. The amount of the total special assessment is subject to adjustment and will not be finalized by the FDIC until after termination of the receiverships. The Company recognized a reduction to expense of $6.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and a net charge of $11.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to adjustments to the loss estimate. 

Market Developments 

The Company's loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market, with CRE related loans comprising approximately 31% and 33% of total loans at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Approximately 16% of CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner occupied at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and approximately 5% were non-owner occupied office loans at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As elevated focus on the evolving industry dynamics facing the CRE market have emerged over the past year, the Company has been proactive in establishing enhanced monitoring policies and procedures as it relates to its CRE loans and has undertaken actions to limit growth of its CRE portfolio, as further discussed in &#8220;Item 1. Business, Lending Activities &#8211; Asset Quality&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized gross charge-offs on CRE non-owner occupied loans totaling $17.6 million, which related to one office property. While the Company believes that its increased monitoring efforts to provide earlier identification of potential stressed loans and proactive engagement with borrowers has helped the Company assess its credit related exposure to this portfolio segment and establish adequate reserve levels, CRE market conditions may worsen, which could result in deterioration of asset quality in this portfolio.

For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics for loans HFI: 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions) Nonaccrual loans $ 401 &#160; $ 273 Repossessed assets 8 &#160; 8 Non-performing assets 494 &#160; 418 Nonaccrual loans to funded loans 0.76 &#160; % 0.54 % Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets 0.51 &#160; 0.40 Allowance for loan losses to funded loans 0.67 &#160; 0.67 Allowance for credit losses to funded loans 0.74 &#160; 0.73 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding (1) 0.18 &#160; 0.06 

(1) Annualized on an actual/actual basis for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Actual year-to-date for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Asset and Deposit Growth 

The Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s growth. 

Total assets increased to $80.6 billion at June 30, 2024 from $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets of $9.7 billion, or 13.7%, was primarily driven by an increase in deposits, which contributed to increases in investment securities and cash of $4.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and funded HFI loan growth of $2.1 billion. Loans HFI increased by $2.1 billion, or 4.2%, to $52.4 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $50.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. C ommercial and industrial loans primarily drove the increase in loans HFI, increasing $2.6 billion from December 31, 2023, which was partially offset by decreases in residential real estate and construction and land development loans of $333 million and $177 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased $605 million from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 primairly due to an increase in agency-conforming and non-EBO loans. 

Total deposits increased $10.9 billion, or 19.7%, to $66.2 billion as of June 30, 2024 from $55.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. By type, the increase in deposits from December 31, 2023 was driven by an increase of $7.0 billion in non-interest bearing deposits, $2.3 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.4 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $262 million in certificates of deposit.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue 

Banking regulations define PPNR as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies. 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of PPNR: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) Net interest income $ 656.6 &#160; $ 550.3 $ 1,255.5 &#160; $ 1,160.2 Total non-interest income 115.2 &#160; 119.0 245.1 &#160; 61.0 Net revenue $ 771.8 &#160; $ 669.3 $ 1,500.6 &#160; $ 1,221.2 Total non-interest expense 486.8 &#160; 387.4 968.6 &#160; 735.3 Pre-provision net revenue $ 285.0 &#160; $ 281.9 $ 532.0 &#160; $ 485.9 Less: Provision for credit losses 37.1 &#160; 21.8 52.3 &#160; 41.2 Income tax expense 54.3 &#160; 44.4 108.7 &#160; 86.8 Net income $ 193.6 &#160; $ 215.7 $ 371.0 &#160; $ 357.9 

Pre-Provision Net Revenue, Excluding FDIC Special Assessment 

The following table shows PPNR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, adjusted to exclude the FDIC special assessment, which management believes is more comparable to historical earnings trends: 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 (in millions) Pre-provision net revenue $ 285.0 &#160; $ 532.0 &#160; FDIC special assessment (6.0) 11.6 &#160; Pre-provision net revenue, excluding FDIC special assessment $ 279.0 &#160; $ 543.6 &#160; Less: Provision for credit losses 37.1 &#160; 52.3 &#160; Income tax expense 54.3 &#160; 108.7 &#160; FDIC special assessment (6.0) 11.6 &#160; Net income $ 193.6 &#160; $ 371.0 &#160; 

Efficiency Ratio 

The following table shows the components used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio, which management uses as a metric for assessing cost efficiency: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in millions) Total non-interest expense $ 486.8 &#160; $ 387.4 $ 968.6 &#160; $ 735.3 Less: Deposit costs 173.7 &#160; 91.0 310.7 &#160; 177.9 Total non-interest expense, excluding deposit costs 313.1 &#160; 296.4 657.9 &#160; 557.4 Divided by: Total net interest income 656.6 &#160; 550.3 1,255.5 &#160; 1,160.2 Plus: Tax equivalent interest adjustment 9.9 &#160; 8.7 19.5 &#160; 17.5 Total non-interest income 115.2 &#160; 119.0 245.1 &#160; 61.0 Less: Deposit costs 173.7 &#160; 91.0 310.7 &#160; 177.9 $ 608.0 &#160; $ 587.0 $ 1,209.4 $ 1,060.8 Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis 62.3 &#160; % 57.1 % 63.7 &#160; % 59.4 % Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent basis, adjusted 51.5 &#160; 50.5 54.4 &#160; 52.5 

Tangible Common Equity and Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 

The following tables present financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets and preferred stock. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars and shares in millions) Total stockholders' equity $ 6,334 &#160; $ 6,078 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets 664 &#160; 669 Preferred stock 295 &#160; 295 Total tangible common stockholders' equity 5,375 &#160; 5,114 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 Total tangible common equity, net of tax $ 5,377 &#160; $ 5,116 Total assets $ 80,581 &#160; $ 70,862 Less: goodwill and intangible assets, net 664 &#160; 669 Tangible assets 79,917 &#160; 70,193 Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets 2 &#160; 2 Total tangible assets, net of tax $ 79,919 &#160; $ 70,195 Tangible common equity ratio 6.7 &#160; % 7.3 % Common shares outstanding 110.2 &#160; 109.5 Book value per common share $ 54.80 &#160; $ 52.81 Tangible book value per common share, net of tax 48.79 &#160; 46.72

Regulatory Capital 

The following table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III, which includes CET1 and total capital. The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, capital ratios and amounts for 2024 include a 25% capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326, compared to a 50% capital benefit for 2023. 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions) Common equity tier 1: Common equity $ 6,052 &#160; $ 5,807 Less: Non-qualifying goodwill and intangibles 651 &#160; 658 Disallowed deferred tax asset 13 &#160; 3 AOCI related adjustments (560) (516) Unrealized gain on changes in fair value liabilities 2 &#160; 3 Common equity tier 1 $ 5,946 &#160; $ 5,659 Divided by: Risk-weighted assets $ 54,028 &#160; $ 52,517 Common equity tier 1 ratio 11.0 &#160; % 10.8 % Common equity tier 1 $ 5,946 &#160; $ 5,659 Plus: Preferred stock and trust preferred securities 376 &#160; 376 Tier 1 capital $ 6,322 &#160; $ 6,035 Divided by: Tangible average assets $ 78,696 &#160; $ 70,295 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.0 &#160; % 8.6 % Total capital: Tier 1 capital $ 6,322 &#160; $ 6,035 Plus: Subordinated debt 819 &#160; 818 Adjusted allowances for credit losses 382 &#160; 348 Tier 2 capital $ 1,201 &#160; $ 1,166 Total capital $ 7,523 &#160; $ 7,201 Total capital ratio 13.9 &#160; % 13.7 % Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance: Classified assets $ 748 &#160; $ 673 Divided by: Tier 1 capital 6,322 &#160; 6,035 Plus: Adjusted allowances for credit losses 382 &#160; 348 Total Tier 1 capital plus adjusted allowances for credit losses $ 6,704 &#160; $ 6,383 Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance 11.2 &#160; % 10.5 % 

Net Interest Margin 

The net interest margin is reported on a TEB. A tax equivalent adjustment is added to reflect interest earned on certain securities and loans that are exempt from federal and state income tax. The following tables set forth the average balances, interest income, interest expense, and average yield (on a fully TEB) for the periods indicated:

Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin 

The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest income was $1.1 billion, an increase of $146.7 million, or 14.7%, compared to $1.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a $101.7 million increase in interest income from loans HFI that was driven by higher average HFI loan balances of $4.0 billion and higher yields and a $78.1 million increase in interest income from investment securities due primarily to an increase in the average investment balance of $6.3 billion. The increase in interest income was also the result of a $29.1 million increase in interest income from cash and other, largely driven by higher average cash and other balances of $1.4 billion. These increases were partially offset by a $62.2 million decrease in interest income from loans HFS driven by lower average HFS loan balances of $3.5 billion. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, interest income was $2.2 billion, an increase of $232.8 million, or 11.8%, compared to $2.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a $133.1 million increase in interest income from loans HFI driven by higher rates coupled with a $900 million increase in the average HFI loan balance and a $126.0 million increase in investment income from investment securities due primarily to an increase in the average investment balance of $5.2 billion. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in interest income from loans HFS of $54.4 million driven by a lower average HFS loan balance of $1.6 billion. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense was $490.9 million, an increase of $40.4 million, or 9.0%, compared to $450.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $159.2 million driven by an $11.6 billion increase in the average interest-bearing deposit balance and increased interest rates, partially offset by a $118.9 million decrease in interest expense on total borrowings resulting from a decrease in average borrowing balances of $8.4 billion. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense was $947.0 million, an increase of $137.5 million, or 17.0%, compared to $809.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased $308.2 million for the same period driven by a $9.6 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and increased interest rates, partially offset by a $171.0 million decrease in interest expense on total borrowings resulting from a decrease in average borrowing balances of $6.4 billion. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, net interest income totaled $656.6 million, an increase of $106.3 million, or 19.3%, compared to $550.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was driven by an $8.2 billion increase in average interest-earning assets and related yields, partially offset by an increase in funding costs driven by the higher rate environment. The increase in net interest margin of 21 basis points to 3.63% is largely the result of an increase in both the average balances and rates of loans HFI, investment securities, and deposits, partially offset by a decrease in the average loans HFS balance compared to the same period in 2023. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net interest income was $1.3 billion, an increase of $95.3 million, or 8.2%, compared to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income reflects a $5.0 billion increase in average interest-earning assets and yields on interest-earnings assets, partially offset by an increase of $3.2 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest margin of 1 basis point to 3.61% is the result of a higher rate environment as explained in the above paragraphs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios based on remaining contractual maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments as of each period end. The Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $37.1 million and $52.3 million, respectively, compared to $21.8 million and $41.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily reflective of net charge-offs of $22.8 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and loan growth. 

Non-interest Income 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest income: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Net gain on loan origination and sale activities $ 46.8 &#160; $ 62.3 $ (15.5) $ 92.1 &#160; $ 93.7 $ (1.6) Net loan servicing revenue 38.1 &#160; 24.1 14.0 &#160; 84.5 &#160; 66.0 18.5 &#160; Service charges and fees 10.8 &#160; 20.8 (10.0) 20.7 &#160; 30.3 (9.6) Commercial banking related income 6.7 &#160; 6.0 0.7 &#160; 13.2 &#160; 12.2 1.0 &#160; Income from equity investments 4.2 &#160; 0.7 3.5 &#160; 21.3 &#160; 2.1 19.2 &#160; Gain (loss) on sales of investment securities 2.3 &#160; (13.6) 15.9 &#160; 1.4 &#160; (26.1) 27.5 &#160; Fair value gain (loss) adjustments, net 0.7 &#160; 12.7 (12.0) 1.0 &#160; (135.1) 136.1 &#160; (Loss) gain on recovery from credit guarantees (2.5) 1.2 (3.7) (3.0) 4.5 (7.5) Other income 8.1 &#160; 4.8 3.3 &#160; 13.9 &#160; 13.4 0.5 &#160; Total non-interest income $ 115.2 &#160; $ 119.0 $ (3.8) $ 245.1 &#160; $ 61.0 $ 184.1 &#160; 

Total non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 decreased $3.8 million. The decrease in non-interest income from the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in service charges and fees of $10.0 million and a net decrease in mortgage banking income of $1.5 million as net gain on loan origination and sale activities decreased $15.5 million from lower production volume and spreads, partially offset by an increase in net loan servicing revenue of $14.0 million. The Company's balance sheet repositioning actions in the prior year also partially offset these decreases as sales activity related to loans and investment securities have normalized in the current period. 

Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $184.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was impacted by the Company's balance sheet repositioning actions, which were largely completed by the end of 2023. These actions resulted in losses of $135.1 million related to fair value adjustments from transferring loans from HFI to HFS and losses on sales of investment securities of $26.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, which did not reoccur in the current period. 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table presents a summary of non-interest expense: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Deposit costs $ 173.7 &#160; $ 91.0 $ 82.7 &#160; $ 310.7 &#160; $ 177.9 $ 132.8 &#160; Salaries and employee benefits 153.0 &#160; 145.6 7.4 &#160; 307.9 &#160; 294.5 13.4 &#160; Data processing 35.7 &#160; 28.6 7.1 &#160; 71.7 &#160; 55.0 16.7 &#160; Insurance 33.8 &#160; 33.0 0.8 &#160; 92.7 &#160; 48.7 44.0 &#160; Legal, professional, and directors' fees 25.8 &#160; 26.4 (0.6) 55.9 &#160; 49.5 6.4 &#160; Occupancy 18.4 &#160; 15.4 3.0 &#160; 35.9 &#160; 31.9 4.0 &#160; Loan servicing expenses 16.6 &#160; 18.4 (1.8) 31.6 &#160; 32.2 (0.6) Business development and marketing 6.4 &#160; 5.0 1.4 &#160; 11.9 &#160; 10.2 1.7 &#160; Loan acquisition and origination expenses 5.1 &#160; 5.6 (0.5) 9.9 &#160; 10.0 (0.1) Gain on extinguishment of debt &#8212; &#160; (0.7) 0.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (13.4) 13.4 &#160; Other expense 18.3 &#160; 19.1 (0.8) 40.4 &#160; 38.8 1.6 &#160; Total non-interest expense $ 486.8 &#160; $ 387.4 $ 99.4 &#160; $ 968.6 &#160; $ 735.3 $ 233.3 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $99.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in deposit costs related to higher ECR balances, which increased from $14.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 to $25.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and higher ECR rates. 

Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $233.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for this period was primarily driven by an increase in deposit and insurance costs. Higher ECR balances and rates drove the increase in deposit costs. The increase in insurance costs is due to elevated insured and brokered deposit levels and a net charge of $11.6 million related to the FDIC special assessment recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Income Taxes 

The Company's effective tax rate was 21.9% and 17.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 22.7% and 19.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rates for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in nondeductible insurance premiums and a decrease in expected investment tax credit benefits during 2024 .

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased $9.7 billion to $80.6 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by an increase in investment securities and cash of $4.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Loans HFI also increased $2.1 billion, or 4.2%, to $52.4 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $50.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in loans HFI from December 31, 2023 was driven by a $2.6 billion increase in commercial and industrial loans from December 31, 2023, partially offset by decreases in residential real estate and construction and land development loans of $333 million and $177 million, respectively. Loans HFS increased $605 million from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 due to an increase in agency conforming and non-EBO loans. 

Total liabilities increased $9.4 billion to $74.2 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $64.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits of $10.9 billion, or 19.7%, to $66.2 billion. By type, the increase in deposits from December 31, 2023 was driven by increases of $7.0 billion in non-interest bearing deposits, $2.3 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.4 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $262 million in certificates of deposit. Other borrowings decreased $1.6 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in short-term borrowings. 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity of $6.3 billion at June 30, 2024 increased by $256 million, or 4.2%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily a function of net income, offset by quarterly dividends to common and preferred stockholders, and unrealized fair value losses on AFS securities, recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income. 

Investment securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities recorded in AOCI in stockholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities included in current period earnings. 

The Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio: 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Debt securities U.S. Treasury securities $ 6,372 &#160; $ 4,853 $ 1,519 &#160; Residential MBS issued by GSEs 5,876 &#160; 1,972 3,904 &#160; Tax-exempt 2,156 &#160; 2,101 55 &#160; Private label residential MBS 1,234 &#160; 1,303 (69) Commercial MBS issued by GSEs 628 &#160; 530 98 &#160; CLO 460 &#160; 1,399 (939) Corporate debt securities 370 &#160; 367 3 &#160; Other 67 &#160; 69 (2) Total debt securities $ 17,163 &#160; $ 12,594 $ 4,569 &#160; Equity securities Preferred stock $ 88 &#160; $ 100 $ (12) CRA investments 26 &#160; 26 &#8212; &#160; Total equity securities $ 114 &#160; $ 126 $ (12) 

The increases in Residential MBS issued by GSEs and U.S. Treasury securities from December 31, 2023 are primarily due the Company's efforts to shift its investment portfolio mix toward high quality liquid assets, which also included the sale of CLOs. 

Loans HFS 

The Company purchases and originates residential mortgage loans through its AmeriHome mortgage banking business channel that are held for sale or securitization. As of June 30, 2024, loans HFS totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $605 million primarily related to an increase in agency-conforming and non-EBO loans. 

Loans HFI 

The table below summarizes the distribution of the Company&#8217;s held for investment loan portfolio: 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Warehouse lending $ 7,611 &#160; $ 6,618 $ 993 &#160; Municipal &#38; nonprofit 1,647 &#160; 1,554 93 &#160; Tech &#38; innovation 3,205 &#160; 2,808 397 &#160; Equity fund resources 943 &#160; 845 98 &#160; Other commercial and industrial 8,473 &#160; 7,452 1,021 &#160; CRE - owner occupied 1,733 &#160; 1,658 75 &#160; Hotel franchise finance 3,612 &#160; 3,855 (243) Other CRE - non-owner occupied 6,337 &#160; 5,974 363 &#160; Residential 12,970 &#160; 13,287 (317) Residential - EBO 1,085 &#160; 1,223 (138) Construction and land development 4,659 &#160; 4,862 (203) Other 155 &#160; 161 (6) Total loans HFI 52,430 &#160; 50,297 2,133 &#160; Allowance for credit losses (352) (337) (15) Total loans HFI, net of allowance $ 52,078 &#160; $ 49,960 $ 2,118 &#160; 

Loans classified as HFI are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an ACL. Net deferred loan fees of $105 million and $108 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $172 million and $177 million increased the carrying value of loans as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company monitors concentrations of lending activities at the product and borrower relationship level. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no borrower relationships at both the commitment and funded loan level exceeded 5% of total loans HFI. 

Commercial and industrial loans made up 41% and 38% of total loans HFI as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

In addition, the Company's loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market as CRE related loans accounted for approximately 31% and 33% of total loans at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. 

The following tables present the composition by property type and weighted average LTV of the Company&#8217;s CRE non-owner occupied loans:

Approximately $2.5 billion, or 4.7%, of total loans HFI consisted of CRE non-owner occupied office loans as of June 30, 2024, compared to $2.4 billion, or 4.7%, as of December 31, 2023. Of the non-owner occupied office loan balance as of June 30, 2024, $235 million is scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2024. These office loans primarily consist of shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects with more modern standards attractive to in-office employers in today&#8217;s environment, including enhanced on-site amenities. The vast majority of these projects are located in suburban locations in the Company's core footprint states (Arizona, California, and Nevada), with central business district and midtown exposure totaling approximately 2% and 10% of office loans as of June 30, 2024, respectively. 

The office loan portfolio largely consists of value-add loans that require significant up-front cash equity contributions from institutional sponsors and large regional and national developers. The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. To a large extent, the financing structures of these loans do not carry junior liens or mezzanine debt, which enables maximum flexibility when working with clients and sponsors. In addition to adhering to conservative underwriting standards, asset-specific credit risk is mitigated through continued sponsor support of projects by re-appraisal rights of the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service, and debt yield covenants. 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 16% of the Company's CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner occupied, with substantially all of these loans secured by first liens and had an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75%. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total non-performing loans increased $76 million to $486 million at June 30, 2024, from $410 million at December 31, 2023.

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The fair value of the Company's MSRs related to residential mortgage loans totaled $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The following is a summary of the UPB of loans underlying the Company's MSR portfolio by type: 

June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) FNMA and FHLMC $ 47,743 &#160; $ 46,840 GNMA 18,113 &#160; 19,848 Non-agency 2,359 &#160; 1,959 Total unpaid principal balance of loans $ 68,215 &#160; $ 68,647 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill and intangible assets totaling $664 million and $669 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company evaluated whether the effects from the bank failures in 2023 gave rise to a triggering event and elected to perform a Step 0 goodwill impairment assessment, which included assessing the financial performance of the Company and analyzing qualitative factors applicable to the Company. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not the fair value of the Company and its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as of June 30, 2023. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

As of June 30, 2024, the net DTA balance totaled $276 million, a decrease of $11 million from $287 million at December 31, 2023. This overall decrease in the net DTA was primarily the result of an increase in DTLs related to MSRs that were partially offset by decreases in the fair market value of AFS securities, paired with increases in credit carryovers and state net operating losses. 

Deposits 

Deposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposit s increased to $66.2 billion at June 30, 2024, from $55.3 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $10.9 billion, or 19.7%. By deposit type, the increase in deposits is attributable to increases of $7.0 billion in non-interest bearing deposits, $2.3 billion in savings and money market accounts, $1.4 billion in interest bearing demand deposits, and $262 million in certificates of deposit. 

WAB is a participant in the IntraFi Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $13.1 billion of these reciprocal deposits, compared to $13.3 billion at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had wholesale brokered deposits of $6.2 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. 

In addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $25.0 billion and $17.8 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company incurred $167.4 million and $87.8 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $298.6 million and $173.4 million, respectively, in deposit related costs on these deposits. Th e increase in these costs from the prior year is due to an increase in average deposit balances eligible for earnings credits or referral fees as well as an increase in earnings credit rates. These costs are reported as Deposit costs in non-interest expense. 

The average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below: 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Average Balance Rate Average Balance Rate (dollars in millions) Interest-bearing demand accounts $ 17,276 &#160; 3.05 &#160; % $ 11,893 2.71 % Savings and money market accounts 16,579 &#160; 3.55 &#160; 13,167 2.66 Certificates of deposit 10,427 &#160; 5.12 &#160; 7,626 4.40 Total interest-bearing deposits 44,282 &#160; 3.73 &#160; 32,686 3.08 Non-interest-bearing deposits 20,996 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 16,701 &#8212; Total deposits $ 65,278 &#160; 2.53 &#160; % $ 49,387 2.04 %

Other Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

The Company utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks or the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has repurchase facilities, collateralized by securities, including assets sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying assets. Total short-term borrowings decreased $1.6 billion to $5.2 billion at June 30, 2024 from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by decreases in FHLB advances of $1.1 billion, repurchase agreements of $374 million, and federal funds purchased of $175 million. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

The Company's long-term borrowings consist of credit linked notes, inclusive of issuance costs. At June 30, 2024, the carrying value of long-term borrowings was $436 million, compared to $446 million at December 31, 2023. 

Qualifying Debt 

Qualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At June 30, 2024, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $897 million, compared to $895 million at December 31, 2023. 

Capital Resources 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, capital ratios and amounts in 2024 include a 25% capital benefit that resulted from the increased ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326, compared to a 50% capital benefit for 2023. 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the various banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables: 

Total Capital Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets Tangible Average Assets Total Capital Ratio Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Common Equity Tier 1 (dollars in millions) June 30, 2024 WAL $ 7,523 &#160; $ 6,322 &#160; $ 54,028 &#160; $ 78,696 &#160; 13.9 &#160; % 11.7 &#160; % 8.0 &#160; % 11.0 &#160; % WAB 7,059 &#160; 6,452 &#160; 53,958 &#160; 78,630 &#160; 13.1 &#160; 12.0 &#160; 8.2 &#160; 12.0 &#160; Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Minimum capital ratios 8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4.5 &#160; December 31, 2023 WAL $ 7,201 $ 6,035 $ 52,517 $ 70,295 13.7 % 11.5 % 8.6 % 10.8 % WAB 6,802 6,229 52,508 70,347 13.0 11.9 8.9 11.9 Well-capitalized ratios 10.0 8.0 5.0 6.5 Minimum capital ratios 8.0 6.0 4.0 4.5 

The Company and the Bank are also subject to liquidity and other regulatory requirements as administered by the federal banking agencies. These agencies have broad powers and at their discretion, could limit or prohibit the Company's payment of dividends, payment of certain debt service and issuance of capital stock and debt as they deem appropriate and as such, actions by the agencies could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. 

The Company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, and HUD. These capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the Company's servicing portfolio or loan production volume. Noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to, and including, removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these requirements as of June 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates upon which the Company's financial condition and results of operations depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled "Critical Accounting Policies" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and all amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events. 

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, loans HFS, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. The Company actively monitors and manages liquidity, and no less than quarterly will estimate probable liquidity needs on a 12-month horizon. Liquidity needs can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. 

The following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit: 

June 30, 2024 Available Balance Outstanding Balance (in millions) Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks $ 1,283 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 

In addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities and warehouse borrowing lines of credit. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit are presented in the following table: 

June 30, 2024 (in millions) FHLB: Borrowing capacity $ 13,689 &#160; Outstanding borrowings 5,100 &#160; Letters of credit 138 &#160; Total available credit $ 8,451 &#160; FRB: Borrowing capacity $ 10,351 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 10,351 &#160; Warehouse borrowings: Borrowing capacity $ 2,250 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Total available credit $ 2,250 &#160; 

The Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet financial obligations and support client activity during normal and stressed operating conditions. At June 30, 2024, there were $13.1 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $3.3 billion in cash on deposit at the FRB and $9.8 billion in securities not currently used as collateral for borrowings or other purposes. At December 31, 2023, the Company maintained $6.9 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $785 million in cash on deposit at the FRB and $6.1 billion in liquid securities not currently used as collateral for borrowings or other purposes. 

The Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make non-discretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months. 

WAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing investment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from correspondent banks, the FHLB of San Francisco, and the FRB. At June 30, 2024, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary. 

The Company&#8217;s liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(1.1) billion and $(100.1) million, respectively. 

The Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company's cash balance decreased by $2.2 billion as a result of a net increase in loans, compared to a increase in cash of $1.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2023 from a net decrease in loans. A net increase in investment securities of $4.4 billion and $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset the increase to the Company's cash balance during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by deposit levels. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, net deposits increased $10.9 billion, compared to a decrease in net deposits of $2.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50 million and $225 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution or, a combined total of $275 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has $1.6 billion of CDARS and $10.0 billion of ICS deposits. 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company has $6.2 billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding, Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. 

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank&#8217;s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $60 million and $120 million, respectively. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $60 million.
