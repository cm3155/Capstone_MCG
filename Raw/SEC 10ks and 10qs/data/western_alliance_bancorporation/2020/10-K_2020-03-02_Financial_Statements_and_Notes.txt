Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 

Western Alliance Bancorporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western Alliance Bancorporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report, dated March 2, 2020 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

As described in Notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses totaled $168 million as of December 31, 2019 . The allowance for credit losses represents an amount considered adequate to absorb estimated probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable, based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience, together with other factors. 

The allowance for credit losses consists of two components: the specific allowance for impaired loans and the general allowance for non-impaired loans. The general allowance is comprised of a quantitative reserve based on the Company&#8217;s historical charge-off experience and a qualitative reserve based on management&#8217;s evaluation of several judgmental factors. The qualitative factors evaluated by management include levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs 

and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; changes in underwriting standards and lending policies; experience, ability and depth of lending staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; changes in credit concentrations; out-of-market exposures; changes in quality of loan review system; and changes in the value of underlying collateral. The evaluation and measurement of these qualitative factors requires management to apply a significant amount of judgment and involves a high degree of estimation. 

We identified the qualitative reserve of the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter because auditing the underlying qualitative factors used in the qualitative reserve involved a high degree of auditor judgment given the high degree of subjectivity exercised by management in developing the qualitative adjustment, which resulted in high estimation uncertainty. 

Our audit procedures related to management&#8217;s evaluation and establishment of the qualitative reserve of the allowance for credit losses include the following, among others: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the evaluation and establishment of the qualitative reserve of the allowance for credit losses and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls related to management&#8217;s assessment and review of the qualitative factor changes and conclusions. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested management&#8217;s process and significant judgments in the evaluation and establishment of the qualitative reserve of the allowance for credit losses, which included: 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Evaluating management&#8217;s considerations and data utilized as a basis for the adjustments relating to qualitative reserve factors, as well as testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s judgments related to the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the considerations and data utilized in the determination of qualitative general reserve factors and the resulting qualitative component of the allowance for credit losses.

WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA, BON, FIB, Bridge, and TPB. The Company also serves business customers through a national platform of specialized financial services. In addition, the Company has two non-bank subsidiaries, LVSP, which held and managed certain OREO properties, and CSI, a captive insurance company formed and licensed under the laws of the State of Arizona and established as part of the Company's overall enterprise risk management strategy. 

Basis of presentation 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with GAAP and conform to practices within the financial services industry. The accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management's estimates and judgments are ongoing and are based on experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions used in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term relate to: the determination of the allowance for credit losses; certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value; and accounting for income taxes. 

Principles of consolidation 

As of December 31, 2019 , WAL has the following significant wholly-owned subsidiaries: WAB and eight unconsolidated subsidiaries used as business trusts in connection with the issuance of trust-preferred securities. 

The Bank has the following significant wholly-owned subsidiaries: WABT, which holds certain investment securities, municipal and nonprofit loans, and leases; WA PWI, which holds certain limited partnerships invested primarily in low income housing tax credits and small business investment corporations; and BW Real Estate, Inc., which operates as a real estate investment trust and holds certain of WAB's real estate loans and related securities. 

The Company does not have any other significant entities that should be consolidated. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts reported in prior periods may have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications have no effect on net income or stockholders&#8217; equity as previously reported. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks (including cash items in process of clearing), and federal funds sold. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company and customer deposit accounts are reported net. 

The Company maintains deposit accounts with other banks, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

Cash reserve requirements 

Depository institutions are required by law to maintain reserves against their transaction deposits. The reserves must be held in cash or with the FRB. Banks are permitted to meet this requirement by maintaining the specified amount as an average balance over a two-week period. The total of reserve balances was approximately $164.1 million and $145.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Investment securities 

Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities may be classified as HTM, AFS, or trading. The appropriate classification is initially decided at the time of purchase. Securities classified as HTM are those debt securities that the Company has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity regardless of changes in market conditions, liquidity needs, or general economic conditions. These securities are carried at amortized cost. The sale of an HTM security within three months of its maturity date or after the majority of the principal outstanding has been collected is considered a maturity for purposes of classification and disclosure. 

Securities classified as AFS or trading securities are reported as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of OCI, except for other-than-temporarily-impaired securities. When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. The changes in the fair values of trading securities are reported in non-interest income. Securities classified as AFS are securities that the Company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations. 

Equity securities are reported as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their estimated fair value, with fair value changes recognized as part of non-interest income in the Consolidated Income Statement. 

Interest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the contractual life of the security, adjusted for prepayments estimates, using the interest method. 

In estimating whether there are any OTTI losses on AFS securities, management considers the: 1) length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; 2) financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; 3) impact of changes in market interest rates; and 4) intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and whether it is not more-likely-than-not the Company would be required to sell the security. 

Declines in the fair value of individual AFS securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings when identified. The fair value of the debt security then becomes the new cost basis. For individual debt securities where the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the other-than-temporary decline in fair value of the debt security related to: 1) credit loss is recognized in earnings; and 2) interest rate, market, or other factors is recognized in OCI. 

For individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or when it is more-likely-than-not the Company will not recover all of its amortized cost, the OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For individual debt securities for which a credit loss has been recognized in earnings, interest accruals and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are suspended when the credit loss is recognized. Interest received after accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis. 

Restricted stock 

WAB is a member of the Federal Reserve System and, as part of its membership, is required to maintain stock in the FRB in a specified ratio to its capital. In addition, WAB is a member of the FHLB system and, accordingly, maintains an investment in capital stock of the FHLB based on the borrowing capacity used. The Bank also maintains an investment in its primary correspondent bank. These investments are considered equity securities with no actively traded market. Therefore, the shares are considered restricted investment securities. These investments are carried at cost, which is equal to the value at which they may be redeemed. The dividend income received from the stock is reported in interest income. The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of its restricted stock to determine if any impairment exists. No impairment has been recorded to date. 

Loans held for sale 

Loans held for sale consist of loans that the Company originates (or acquires) and intends to sell. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based on available market data for similar assets, expected cash flows, and appraisals of underlying collateral or the credit quality of the borrower. Gains and losses on the sale of loans are recognized pursuant to ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. Interest income on these loans is accrued daily and loan origination fees and costs are deferred and included in the cost basis of the loan. The Company issues various representations and warranties associated with these loan sales. The Company has not experienced any losses as a result of these representations and warranties. 

Loans, held for investment 

The Company generally holds loans for investment and has the intent and ability to hold loans until their maturity. Therefore, they are reported at book value. Net loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts, purchase accounting fair value adjustments, and an allowance for credit losses. In addition, the book values of loans subject to a fair value hedge are adjusted for changes in value attributable to the effective portion of the hedged benchmark interest rate risk. 

The Company may also acquire loans through a business combination. These acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of purchase, which is comprised of unpaid principal adjusted for estimated credit losses and interest rate fair value adjustments. Loans are evaluated individually at the acquisition date to determine if there has been credit deterioration since origination. Such loans may then be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans based on common characteristics. When the Company acquires such loans, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of the Company&#8217;s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the Company&#8217;s initial investment in the loan. The excess of contractual cash flows over the cash flows expected to be collected may not be recognized as an adjustment to yield, loss, or a valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan&#8217;s yield over the remaining life. Subsequent decreases to cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairment losses. The Company may not carry over or create a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired under these circumstances. For purchased loans that are not deemed impaired at the acquisition date, fair value adjustments attributable to both credit and interest rates are accreted (or amortized) over the contractual life of the individual loan. For additional information, see " Note 3. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Deferred loan fees and costs, premiums and discounts, and certain purchase accounting fair value adjustments, are amortized over the contractual life of the loan through interest income. If a loan has scheduled payments, the amortization of the net deferred loan fee is calculated using the interest method over the contractual life of the loan. If a loan does not have scheduled payments, such as a line of credit, the net deferred loan fee is recognized as interest income on a straight-line basis over the contractual life of the loan commitment. Commitment fees based on a percentage of a customer&#8217;s unused line of credit and fees related to standby letters of credit are recognized over the commitment period. When loans are repaid, any remaining unamortized balances of premiums, discounts, or net deferred fees are recognized as interest income. 

Non-accrual loans: When a borrower discontinues making payments as contractually required by the note, the Company must determine whether it is appropriate to continue to accrue interest. The Company ceases accruing interest income when the loan has become delinquent by more than 90 days or when management determines that the full repayment of principal and collection of interest according to contractual terms is no longer likely. The Company may decide to continue to accrue interest on certain loans more than 90 days delinquent if the loans are well secured by collateral and in the process of collection. 

For all loan types, when a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all interest accrued but uncollected is reversed against interest income in the period in which the status is changed, and the Company makes a loan-level decision to apply either the cash basis or cost recovery method. The Company recognizes income on a cash basis only for those non-accrual loans for which the collection of the remaining principal balance is not in doubt. Under the cost recovery method, subsequent payments received from the customer are applied to principal and generally no further interest income is recognized until the principal has been paid in full or until circumstances have changed such that payments are again consistently received as contractually required. 

Impaired loans: A loan is identified as impaired when it is no longer probable that interest and principal will be collected according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured for reserve requirements in accordance with ASC 310, Receivables , based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less applicable disposition costs if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of an impairment reserve, if any, and any subsequent changes are recorded as a provision for credit losses. Losses are recorded as a charge-off when losses are confirmed. In addition to management's internal loan review process, regulators may from time to time direct the Company to modify loan grades, loan impairment calculations, or loan impairment methodology. 

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans: A TDR loan is a loan in which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. A TDR loan is also considered impaired. A TDR loan may be returned to accrual status when the loan is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual restructured terms for a reasonable period of time (generally six months) and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual restructured principal and interest is no longer in doubt. However, such loans continue to be considered impaired. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

Allowance for credit losses 

Credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans and leases to borrowers, for which the Company must maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses recorded to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the contractual principal or interest will not be collected. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is an amount believed adequate to absorb estimated probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable, based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience, together with other factors. The Company formally re-evaluates and establishes the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. 

The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific allowance applies to impaired loans. For impaired collateral dependent loans, the reserve is calculated based on the collateral value, net of estimated disposition costs. Generally, the Company obtains an independent collateral valuation analysis for each loan over a specified dollar threshold every 12 months. Loans not collateral dependent are evaluated based on the expected future cash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate. 

The general allowance covers all non-impaired loans and incorporates several quantitative and qualitative factors, which are used for all of the Company's portfolio segments. Quantitative factors include company-specific, 10-year historical net charge-offs stratified by loans with similar characteristics. Qualitative factors include: 1) levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; 2) levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 3) trends in volume and terms of loans; 4) changes in underwriting standards or lending policies; 5) experience, ability, depth of lending staff; 6) national and local economic trends and conditions; 7) changes in credit concentrations; 8) out-of-market exposures; 9) changes in quality of loan review system; and 10) changes in the value of underlying collateral. 

Due to the credit concentration of the Company's loan portfolio in real estate secured loans, the value of collateral is heavily dependent on real estate values in Arizona, Nevada, and California. While management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, regulators, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Bank's allowance for credit losses, and may require the Bank to make adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management regularly reviews the assumptions and formulae used in determining the allowance and makes adjustments if required to reflect the current risk profile of the portfolio. 

Transfers of financial assets 

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed surrendered when the: 1) assets have been isolated from the Company; 2) transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and 3) Company no longer maintains effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase the transferred assets before maturity. 

Premises and equipment 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the following estimated lives: 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160;

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 

&#160;

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

Depreciation is recorded over the lesser of the relevant 3 to 10 year term or the remaining life of the lease. 

##TABLE_END Management periodically reviews premises and equipment in order to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the value of an asset is not recoverable. 

Leases (lessee) 

At inception, contracts are evaluated to determine whether the contract constitutes a lease agreement. For contracts that are determined to be an operating lease, a corresponding ROU asset and operating lease liability are recorded in separate line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A ROU asset represents the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and a lease liability represents the Company&#8217;s commitment to make contractually obligated lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease and are based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The measurement of the operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments made and is reduced by lease incentives that are paid or are payable to the Company. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate such as the Consumer Price Index are included in lease payments based on the rate in effect at the commencement date of the lease. Lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis as part of occupancy expense over the lease term. 

As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company's incremental collateralized borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of lease payments. This rate gives consideration to the applicable FHLB collateralized borrowing rates and is based on the information available at the commencement date. The Company has elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less; therefore, these leases are not recorded on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet, but rather, lease expense is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised. 

In addition to the package of practical expedients, the Company also elected the practical expedient that allows lessees to make an accounting policy election to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component, and instead account for them all together as part of the applicable lease component. This practical expedient can be elected separately for each underlying class of asset. The majority of the Company&#8217;s non-lease components such as common area maintenance, parking, and taxes are variable, and are expensed as incurred. Variable payment amounts are determined in arrears by the landlord depending on actual costs incurred. 

Goodwill and other intangible assets 

The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with applicable guidance. The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company can first elect to assess, through qualitative factors, whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If the qualitative assessment indicates potential impairment, a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If, based on the quantitative test, a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge for this difference is recorded to current period earnings as non-interest expense. 

The Company&#8217;s intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangible assets that are amortized over periods ranging from five to 10 years. The Company considers the remaining useful lives of its core deposit intangible assets each reporting period, as required by ASC 350, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other , to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset&#8217;s remaining useful life has changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. The Company has not revised its estimates of the useful lives of its core deposit intangibles during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , or 2017 . 

Low income housing and renewable energy tax credits 

The Company holds ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in affordable housing and renewable energy projects. These investments are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits and deductions, which may be subject to recapture by taxing authorities if compliance requirements are not met. The Company accounts for its low income housing investments using the proportional amortization method. Renewable energy projects are accounted for under the deferral method, whereby the investment tax credits are reflected as an immediate reduction in income taxes payable and the carrying value of the asset in the period that the investment tax credits are claimed. See " Note 14. Income Taxes " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

The Company evaluates its interests in these entities to determine if it has a variable interest and whether it is required to consolidate these entities. A variable interest is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of an entity's expected losses or receive portions of the entity's expected residual returns. If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in an entity, it evaluates whether such interest is in a variable interest entity. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either: 1) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or 2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company is required to consolidate any VIE when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE's operations. 

A variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company&#8217;s assessment of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE includes consideration of various factors such as: 1) the Company's ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; 2) its form of ownership interest; 3) its representation on the entity's governing body; 4) the size and seniority of its investment; and 5) its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity. The Company is required to evaluate whether to consolidate a VIE both at inception and on an ongoing basis as changes in circumstances require reconsideration. 

The Company&#8217;s investments in qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects meet the definition of a VIE as the entities are structured such that the limited partner investors lack substantive voting rights. The general partner or managing member has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities. Accordingly, as a limited partner, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and is not required consolidate these entities. 

Bank owned life insurance 

BOLI is carried at its cash surrender value with changes recorded in other non-interest income in the Consolidated Income Statements. The face amount of the underlying policies including death benefits was $ 359.0 million and $ 358.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. There are no loans offset against cash surrender values, and there are no restrictions as to the use of proceeds. 

Customer repurchase agreements 

The Company enters into repurchase agreements with customers, whereby it pledges securities against overnight investments made from the customer&#8217;s excess collected funds. The Company records these at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. 

Stock compensation plans 

The Company has the Incentive Plan, as amended, which is described more fully in " Note 10. Stockholders' Equity " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Compensation expense for stock options and non-vested restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the award on the measurement date which, for the Company, is the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the service period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of the award grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. The fair value of non-vested restricted stock awards is the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the date of grant. 

See " Note 10. Stockholders' Equity " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of stock options and restricted stock awards. 

Dividends 

WAL is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a holding company with limited significant assets other than the capital stock of its subsidiaries, WAL's ability to pay dividends depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from its subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to WAL is subject to, among other things, their individual earnings, financial condition, and need for funds, as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to WAL and each of those subsidiaries, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval. In addition, the terms and conditions of other securities the Company issues may restrict its ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's common stock. For example, if any required payments on outstanding trust preferred securities are not made, WAL would be prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock. 

Treasury shares 

The Company separately presents treasury shares, which represent shares surrendered to the Company equal in value to the statutory payroll tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of employee restricted stock awards. Treasury shares are carried at cost. 

Common stock repurchases 

On December 11, 2018, the Company adopted its common stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $250.0 million of its shares of common stock through December 31, 2019. All shares repurchased under the plan are retired upon settlement. The Company has elected the method to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of its common stock between APIC and retained earnings, with the portion allocated to APIC limited to the amount of APIC that was recorded at the time that the shares were initially issued, which is calculated on a last-in, first-out basis. The Company's common stock repurchase program was renewed through December 2020, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an additional $250.0 million of its outstanding common stock. 

Derivative financial instruments 

The Company uses interest-rate swaps to mitigate interest-rate risk associated with changes to the fair value of certain fixed-rate financial instruments (fair value hedges). 

The Company recognizes derivatives as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. 

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not considered to be highly effective in hedging the change in fair value of the hedged item are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change. 

The Company documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction after the derivative contract is executed. At inception, the Company performs a quantitative assessment to determine whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective (as defined in the guidance) in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Retroactive effectiveness is assessed, as well as the continued expectation that the hedge will remain effective prospectively. After the initial quantitative assessment is performed, on a quarterly basis, the Company performs a qualitative hedge effectiveness assessment. This assessment takes into consideration any adverse developments related to the counterparty's risk of default and any negative events or circumstances that affect the factors that originally enabled the Company to assess that it could reasonably support, qualitatively, an expectation that the hedging relationship was and will continue to be highly effective. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that a hedge is no longer highly effective. When hedge accounting is discontinued on a fair value hedge that no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative instrument continues to be reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but the carrying amount of the hedged item is no longer adjusted for future changes in fair value. The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item that existed at the date hedge accounting is discontinued is amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item into earnings. 

Derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, so called free-standing derivatives, are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of change. 

The Company may in the normal course of business purchase a financial instrument or originate a loan that contains an embedded derivative instrument. Upon purchasing the instrument or originating the loan, the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the financial instrument (i.e., the host contract) and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and carried at fair value. However, in cases where the host contract is measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, or the Company is unable to reliably identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value and is not designated as a hedging instrument. 

Off-balance sheet instruments 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into off-balance sheet financial instrument arrangements consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements when they are funded. They involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Losses could be experienced when the Company is contractually obligated to make a payment under these instruments and must seek repayment from the borrower, which may not be as financially sound in the current period as they were when the commitment was originally made. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and, in certain instances, may be unconditionally cancelable. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company enters into credit arrangements that generally provide for the termination of advances in the event of a covenant violation or other event of default. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer&#8217;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the party. The commitments are collateralized by the same types of assets used as loan collateral. 

As with outstanding loans, the Company applies qualitative factors and utilization rates to its off-balance sheet obligations in determining an estimate of losses inherent in these contractual obligations. The estimate for credit losses on off-balance sheet instruments is included in other liabilities and the charge to income that establishes this liability is included in non-interest expense. 

The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements related to its derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements at fair value and their notional values are carried off-balance sheet. See " Note 12. Derivatives and Hedging Activities " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Business combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, exceeds the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Changes to estimated fair values from a business combination are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill during the measurement period and are recognized in the proper reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Results of operations of an acquired business are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges, are expensed as incurred. 

Fair values of financial instruments 

The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement, as well as enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The Company uses various valuation approaches, including market, income, and/or cost approaches. ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company&#8217;s assumptions about the factors market participants would consider in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs, as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, prepayment speeds, volatilities, etc.) or model-based valuation techniques where all significant assumptions are observable, either directly or indirectly, in the market. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques where one or more significant inputs are not observable, either directly or indirectly, in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company&#8217;s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include use of matrix pricing, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. 

##TABLE_END The availability of observable inputs varies based on the nature of the specific financial instrument. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who may purchase the asset or assume the liability, rather than an entity-specific measure. When market assumptions are available, ASC 820 requires the Company to make assumptions regarding the assumptions that market participants would use to estimate the fair value of the financial instrument at the measurement date. 

ASC 825, Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. 

Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments; however, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales transaction at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The estimated fair value amounts for December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been measured as of period-end, and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements subsequent to those dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the reporting date may be different than the amounts reported at period-end. 

The information in " Note 16. Fair Value Accounting " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimate, comparisons between the Company&#8217;s disclosures and those of other companies or banks may not be meaningful. 

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: 

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 

The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and due from banks approximate their fair value. 

Money market investments 

The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for money market investments approximate their fair value. 

Investment securities 

The fair values of CRA investments, exchange-listed preferred stock, trust preferred securities, and certain corporate debt securities are based on quoted market prices and are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The fair values of debt securities are primarily determined based on matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique that utilizes observable market inputs including, for example, yield curves, credit ratings, and prepayment speeds. Fair values determined using matrix pricing are generally categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For a small subset of securities, other pricing sources are used, including observed prices on publicly-traded securities and dealer quotes. 

Restricted stock 

WAB is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB and, accordingly, maintains investments in the capital stock of the FRB and the FHLB. WAB also maintains an investment in its primary correspondent bank. These investments are carried at cost since no ready market exists for them, and they have no quoted market value. The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of its restricted stock to determine if any impairment exists. The fair values of these investments have been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans 

The fair value of loans is estimated based on discounted cash flows using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers with similar credit quality and adjustments that the Company believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value based on a third party independent valuation. As a result, the fair value for loans is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, excluding impaired loans, which are categorized as Level 3. 

Accrued interest receivable and payable 

The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for accrued interest receivable and payable approximate their fair value. 

Derivative financial instruments 

All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. The fair value for derivatives is determined based on market prices, broker-dealer quotations on similar products, or other related input parameters. As a result, the fair values have been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Deposits 

The fair value disclosed for demand and savings deposits is by definition equal to the amount payable on demand at their reporting date (that is, their carrying amount), which the Company believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. The carrying amount for variable-rate deposit accounts approximates their fair value. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on these deposits. The fair value measurement of the deposit liabilities is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

FHLB advances and customer repurchase agreements 

The fair values of the Company&#8217;s borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The FHLB advances and customer repurchase agreements have been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy due to their short durations. 

Subordinated debt 

The fair value of subordinated debt is based on the market rate for the respective subordinated debt security. Subordinated debt has been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Junior subordinated debt 

Junior subordinated debt is valued based on a discounted cash flow model which uses as inputs Treasury Bond rates and the 'BB' rated financial index. Junior subordinated debt has been categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Off-balance sheet instruments 

The fair value of the Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) is based on quoted fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements, and the counterparties&#8217; credit standing. 

Income taxes 

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and files a consolidated federal income tax return with all of its subsidiaries, with the exception of BW Real Estate, Inc. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their income tax bases using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. 

Net deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent that these assets will more-likely-than-not be realized. In making these determinations, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent operating results. If it is determined that deferred income tax assets to be realized in the future are in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded, which will reduce the Company's provision for income taxes. 

A tax benefit from an unrecognized tax benefit may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including related appeals or litigation, based on technical merits. Income tax benefits must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. 

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement. Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related tax liability line with other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See " Note 14. Income Taxes " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes. 

Non-interest income 

Non-interest income includes service charges and fees, income from equity investments, card income, foreign currency income, income from bank owned life insurance, lending related income, net gain or loss on sales of investment securities, net unrealized gains or losses on assets measured at fair value, and other income. Service charges and fees consist of fees earned from performance of account analysis, general account services, and other deposit account services. These fees are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Income from equity investments includes gains on equity warrant assets, SBIC equity income, and success fees. Card income includes fees earned from customer use of debit and credit cards, interchange income from merchants, and international charges. Card income is generally within the scope of ASC 310, Receivables ; however, certain processing transactions for merchants, such as interchange fees, are within the scope of ASC 606. Foreign currency income represents fees earned on the differential between purchases and sales of foreign currency on behalf of the Company&#8217;s clients. Income from bank owned life insurance is accounted for in accordance with ASC 325, Investments - Other . Lending related income includes fees earned from gains or losses on the sale of loans, SBA income, and letter of credit fees. Gains and losses on the sale of loans and SBA income are recognized pursuant to ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing . Net unrealized gains or losses on assets measured at fair value represent fair value changes in equity securities and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities . Fees related to standby letters of credit are accounted for in accordance with ASC 440, Commitments . Other income includes operating lease income, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with ASC 840, Leases . Net gain or loss on sales / valuations of repossessed and other assets is presented as a component of non-interest expense, but may also be presented as a component of non-interest income in the event that a net gain is recognized. Net gain or loss on sales of repossessed and other assets are accounted for in accordance with ASC 610, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. See " Note 22. Revenue from Contracts with Customers " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the nature and timing of revenue recognition for non-interest income revenue streams within the scope of the new standard. 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The new standard significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, including off-balance sheet credit exposures, from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , require that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on AFS debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has completed its implementation of the new CECL standard, in all material respects, as model findings have been addressed, the Company's internal control CECL framework has been implemented, and accounting policies and governance processes have been finalized. 

The following table summarizes the estimated allowance for credit losses related to financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures upon adoption of ASC 326:

##TABLE_END

As the impact to the Company was not significant, management elected to take the full charge to regulatory capital at the adoption date. 

In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . The amendments within ASU 2018-13 remove, modify, and supplement the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Disclosure requirements that were removed include: the amount and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date. Additional disclosure requirements include: the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. With the exception of the above additional disclosure requirements, which will be applied prospectively, all other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) . The amendments in this ASU align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). Accordingly, the amendments in this Update require an entity (customer) in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The amendments in this Update also require that the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement. Presentation requirements include: expense related to the capitalized implementation costs should be presented in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement, payments for capitalized implementation costs in the statement of cash flows should be classified in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element, and capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position should be presented in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated 

hosting arrangement would be presented. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In April 2019, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments . The amendments in ASU 2019-04 clarify or correct the guidance in these Topics. With respect to Topic 326, ASU 2019-04 addresses a number of issues as it relates to the CECL standard including consideration of accrued interest, recoveries, variable-rate financial instruments, prepayments, and extension and renewal options, among other things, in the measurement of expected credit losses. The amendments to Topic 326 have the same effective dates as ASU 2016-13 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , ASU 2019-04 clarifies issues related to partial-term hedges, hedged debt securities, and transitioning from a quantitative method of assessing hedge effectiveness to a more simplified method. The Company does not have partial-term hedges or any hedged debt securities and the transition issues discussed in the ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to the Company. Accordingly, the amendments to Topic 815 will not have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to Topic 825, Financial Instruments, on recognizing and measuring financial instruments, ASU 2019-04 addresses: 1) the scope of the guidance; 2) the requirement for remeasurement under ASC 820 when using the measurement alternative; 3) certain disclosure requirements; and 4) which equity securities have to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. The amendments to Topic 825 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In May 2019, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , to provide entities with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost. The election is to be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis upon adoption of Topic 326 and is not available for either AFS or HTM debt securities. The amendments in ASU 2019-05 should be applied on a modified-retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date that an entity adopts the amendments in ASU 2016-13. The Company did not elect this fair value option as part of its adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. 

In November 2019, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses. The amendments in ASU 2019-11 clarify or address specific issues about certain aspects of the amendments in ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . These issues include measurement and reporting requirements related to: 1) the allowance for credit losses for purchased assets with credit deterioration; 2) prepayment assumptions on existing troubled debt restructurings; 3) extension of disclosure relief for accrued interest receivable balances; and 4) expected credit losses on collateralized financial assets. The adoption of ASU 2019-11 is concurrent with ASU 2016-13 and, adoption of these amendments on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of applying ASC 740. The amendments that are applicable to the Company address: 1) franchise and other taxes partially based on income; 2) step-up in basis of goodwill in a business combination; 3) allocation of tax expense in separate entity financial statements; and 4) interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or rate changes. The amendments to Topic 740 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Recently adopted accounting guidance 

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2016-02, Leases . The amendments in ASU 2016-02 to Topic 842, Leases , require lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The Company adopted the amendments to Topic 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The Company elected the transition option issued under ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements , which allows entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases , to prior periods, including disclosure requirements. Accordingly, prior period financial results and disclosures have not been adjusted. The Company also elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitting entities to forgo reassessment of: 1) expired or existing contracts that may contain leases; 2) lease classification of expired or existing leases; and 3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company established internal controls and implemented lease accounting software to facilitate the preparation of financial information and disclosures related to leases. The most significant impact of the new standard on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements was the recognition of a ROU asset and lease liability for operating leases for which the Company is the lessee. The accounting for finance and operating leases for which the Company is the lessor remains substantially unchanged. Upon adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded 

a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability of $42.5 million and $46.1 million, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings resulted from adoption of this guidance. The new standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or cash flows. 

In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2017-08, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities . The amendments in ASU 2017-08 to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs , shorten the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium to the earliest call date, which more closely align the amortization period of premiums and discounts to expectations incorporated in market pricing on the underlying securities. Under current GAAP, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life of the instrument. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. As of December 31, 2019, the Company does not hold these types of securities; therefore, adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In June 2018, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments in ASU 2018-07 to Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , are intended to align the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Changes to the accounting for nonemployee awards include: 1) equity classified share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees will now be measured on the grant date, instead of the previous requirement to remeasure the awards through the performance completion date; 2) for performance conditions, compensation cost associated with the award will be recognized when achievement of the performance condition is probable, rather than upon achievement of the performance condition; and 3) the current requirement to reassess the classification (equity or liability) for nonemployee awards upon vesting will be eliminated, except for awards in the form of convertible instruments. The new guidance also clarifies that any share-based payment awards issued to customers should be evaluated under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company's share-based payment awards to nonemployees consist only of grants made to the Company's BOD as compensation solely related to the individual's role as a Director. As such, in accordance with ASC 718, the Company accounts for these share-based payment awards to its Directors in the same manner as share-based payment awards for its employees. Accordingly, the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the accounting for the Company's share-based payment awards to its Directors. 

In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements . The amendments in ASU 2018-09 are intended to clarify or correct unintended guidance in the FASB Codification and affect a wide variety of Topics in the Codification. The topics that are applicable to the Company include: 1) debt modifications and extinguishments; 2) stock compensation; and 3) derivatives and hedging. For debt modifications and extinguishments, the amendment clarifies that, in an early extinguishment of debt for which the fair value option has been elected, the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt is equal to its fair value at the reacquisition date, and upon extinguishment, the cumulative amount of the gain or loss on the extinguished debt that resulted from changes in instrument-specific credit risk should be presented in net income. The Company has junior subordinated debt that is recorded at fair value at each reporting period due to election of the FVO. Accordingly, if, in the future, the Company chooses to repay this debt prior to its contractual maturity, this amendment would be applicable. For stock compensation, the amendment clarifies that excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies should be recognized in the period in which the amount of the tax deduction is determined, which is typically when an award is exercised (in the case of share options) or vests (in the case of non-vested stock awards). The Company already records excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies in the periods in which the tax deduction is determined. Therefore, adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on the Company's accounting for excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies. For derivatives and hedging, previous guidance permits derivatives to be offset only when all four conditions (including the intent to set off) are met. This amendment clarifies that the intent to set off is not required to offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that are executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. This amendment did not have an effect on the offsetting of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities.

##TABLE_END

The Company conducts an OTTI analysis on a quarterly basis. The initial indication of OTTI is a decline in the market value below the amount recorded for an investment, and taking into account the severity and duration of the decline. Another potential indication of OTTI is a downgrade below investment grade. In determining whether an impairment is OTTI, the Company considers the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost, recent events specific to the issuer, including investment downgrades by rating agencies and economic conditions of its industry, and the Company&#8217;s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. 

For debt securities, for the purpose of an OTTI analysis, the Company also considers the cause of the price decline (general level of interest rates, credit spreads, and industry and issuer-specific factors), whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the issuer&#8217;s financial condition, near-term prospects, and current ability to make future payments in a timely manner, as well as the issuer&#8217;s ability to service debt, and any change in agencies&#8217; ratings at the evaluation date from the acquisition date and any likely imminent action. 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company&#8217;s unrealized losses relate primarily to market interest rate increases since the securities' original purchase date. The total number of AFS securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2019 is 158 , compared to 373 at December 31, 2018 . The Company has reviewed securities for which there is an unrealized loss in accordance with its accounting policy for OTTI described above and determined that there are no impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . The Company does not consider any securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . No assurance can be made that OTTI will not occur in future periods. 

Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position follows:

##TABLE_END

During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company sold certain AFS securities as part of a portfolio re-balancing initiative. These securities had a carrying value of $147.2 million and a net gain of $ 3.2 million was recognized on the sale of these securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company also sold one of its securities classified as HTM. The security had a par value of $10.0 million and no gain or loss was realized upon the sale. The sale of this HTM security was made as a result of significant deterioration in the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness, representative of a change in circumstance contemplated in ASC 320-10-25 that would not call into question the Company&#8217;s intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. Accordingly, management concluded that the Company&#8217;s remaining HTM securities continue to be appropriately classified as such. 

During the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company sold certain available-for-sale securities with a carrying value of $119.8 million and recognized a loss on sale of these securities of $ 7.7 million . The sales resulted from management&#8217;s review of its investment portfolio, which led to its decision to sell lower yielding securities and reinvest in securities with higher yields and shorter durations.

The composition of the Company&#8217;s held for investment loan portfolio is as follows:

##TABLE_END

The reduction in interest income associated with loans on non-accrual status was approximately $ 2.2 million , $ 2.3 million , and $ 2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. 

The Company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem loans. Under the Company&#8217;s risk rating system, the Company classifies problem and potential problem loans as Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Substandard loans include those characterized by well-defined weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as Doubtful, or risk rated eight, have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The final rating of Loss covers loans considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. Loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses that warrant management&#8217;s close attention, are deemed to be Special Mention. Risk ratings are updated, at a minimum, quarterly. 

The following tables present loans held for investment by risk rating:

##TABLE_END

A valuation allowance is established for an impaired loan when the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment. In certain cases, portions of impaired loans are written down to realizable value instead of establishing a valuation allowance and are included, when applicable, in the table above as &#8220;Impaired loans without a specific valuation allowance under ASC 310.&#8221; However, before concluding that an impaired loan needs no associated valuation allowance, an assessment is made to consider all available and relevant information for the method used to evaluate impairment and the type of loan being assessed. The valuation allowance disclosed above is included in the allowance for credit losses reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest followed by reductions in interest rates or accrued interest. A TDR loan is also considered impaired. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

The following table presents information on the financial effects of TDR loans by class for the periods presented:

5. LEASES 

Adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases 

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the amendments to ASC 842, Leases , which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the new lease guidance using the modified retrospective approach and elected the transition option issued under ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements , allowing entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases , to prior periods, including disclosure requirements. Accordingly, prior period financial results and disclosures have not been adjusted. 

The Company has operating leases under which it leases its branch offices, corporate headquarters, other offices, and data facility centers. Upon adoption of the new lease guidance, on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability of $42.5 million and $46.1 million, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's operating lease ROU asset and operating lease liability totaled $ 72.6 million and $ 78.1 million , respectively. The increase in the operating lease ROU asset and the operating lease liability from the adoption date is due to execution of multiple office lease extensions and new office lease agreements subsequent to the adoption date. A weighted average discount rate of 3.08 % was used in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability as of December 31, 2019 . 

The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of one to 11 years, with a weighted average lease term of 8.4 years at December 31, 2019 . Some leases include multiple five-year renewal options. The Company&#8217;s decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has 

no leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain and therefore, options to renew were not factored into the calculation of its ROU asset and lease liability as of December 31, 2019 . 

The following is a schedule of the Company's operating lease liabilities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2019 :

Total operating lease costs of $ 12.9 million and other lease costs of $ 4.0 million , which include common area maintenance, parking, and taxes during the year ended December 31, 2019 , were included as part of occupancy expense. Short-term lease costs were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019 . For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , rent expense associated with the Company's operating leases totaled $ 11.0 million and $ 10.4 million , respectively.

6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Goodwill represents the excess consideration paid for net assets acquired in a business combination over their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill of $ 289.9 million as of December 31, 2019 , which has been allocated to the Nevada, Northern California, Technology &#38; Innovation, and HFF operating segments. 

The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 of each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , there were no events or circumstances that indicated an interim impairment test of goodwill or other intangible assets was necessary and, based on the Company's annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 of each of these years, it was determined that goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired. 

The following is a summary of the Company's acquired intangible assets:

WAB is a participant in the Promontory Interfinancial Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. Federal banking law and regulation places restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship-based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had $ 407.7 million and $ 322.9 million , respectively, of reciprocal CDARS deposits and $ 661.8 million and $ 706.9 million , respectively, of ICS deposits. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had $ 1.1 billion and $ 718.2 million , respectively, of wholesale brokered deposits. In addition, non-interest-bearing deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $ 3.1 billion and $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

##TABLE_START (1) 

The purchase accounting adjustment is being accreted over the remaining life of the trusts, pursuant to accounting guidance. 

##TABLE_END With the exception of debt issued by Bridge Capital Trust I and Bridge Capital Trust II, junior subordinated debt is recorded at fair value at each reporting date due to the FVO election made by the Company under ASC 825. The Company did not make the FVO election for the junior subordinated debt acquired as part of the Bridge acquisition. Accordingly, the carrying value of these trusts does not reflect the current fair value of the debt and includes a fair market value adjustment established at acquisition that is being accreted over the remaining life of the trusts. 

The weighted average interest rate of all junior subordinated debt as of December 31, 2019 was 4.25 % , which is three-month LIBOR plus the contractual spread of 2.34% , compared to a weighted average interest rate of 5.15 % at December 31, 2018 . 

In the event of certain changes or amendments to regulatory requirements or federal tax rules, the debt is redeemable in whole. The obligations under these instruments are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all other liabilities of the Company. Based on guidance issued by the FRB, the Company's securities continue to qualify as Tier 1 Capital. 

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Stock awards available for grant at December 31, 2019 were 2.9 million . 

Restricted stock awards granted to employees generally vest over a three -year period. Stock grants made to non-employee WAL directors in 2019 became fully vested on July 1, 2019. The Company estimates the compensation cost for stock grants based upon the grant date fair value. Stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Stock compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock options granted to employees are included in Salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Income Statement. For restricted stock awards granted to WAL directors, related stock compensation expense is included in Legal, professional, and directors' fees. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recognized $ 17.4 million in stock-based compensation expense related to these stock grants, compared to $ 16.6 million in 2018 , and $ 14.3 million in 2017 . 

In addition, the Company previously granted shares of restricted stock to certain members of executive management that had both performance and service conditions that affect vesting. There were no such grants made during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018; however, expense is still being recognized for the grants made in 2017 as they also have a three-year vesting period. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recognized $ 1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense related to these performance-based restricted stock grants, compared to $ 2.5 million in 2018 , and $ 2.3 million in 2017 . 

A summary of the status of the Company&#8217;s unvested shares of restricted stock and changes during the years then ended is presented below:

##TABLE_END

The total weighted average grant date fair value of all stock awards, including the performance-based restricted stock awards, granted during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $ 23.7 million , $ 24.7 million , and $ 26.1 million , respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock that vested during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $ 21.3 million , $ 27.4 million , and $ 29.1 million , respectively. 

As of December 31, 2019 , there was $ 23.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.62 years. 

Performance Stock Units 

The Company grants to members of its executive management performance stock units that do not vest unless the Company achieves a specified cumulative EPS target and a TSR performance measure over a three-year performance period. The number of shares issued will vary based on the cumulative EPS target and relative TSR performance factor that is achieved. The Company estimates the cost of performance stock units based upon the grant date fair value and expected vesting percentage over the three-year performance period. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recognized $ 6.9 million in stock-based compensation expense related to these performance stock units, compared to $ 6.4 million and $ 6.5 million in stock-based compensation expense for such units in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

The three-year performance period for the 2016 grant ended on December 31, 2018 , and the Company's cumulative EPS for the performance period exceeded the level required for a maximum award under the terms of the grant. As a result, executive management members were entitled to the maximum award of 202,776 shares, which was paid out in the first quarter of 2019. 

The three-year performance period for the 2017 grant ended on December 31, 2019 , and the Company's cumulative EPS and TSR performance measure for the performance period exceeded the level required for a maximum award under the terms of the grant. As a result, 163,901 shares will become fully vested and distributed to executive management in the first quarter of 2020 . 

Common Stock Repurchase 

On December 12, 2018, the Company announced that it had adopted a common stock repurchase plan, pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $ 250 million of its shares of common stock through December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company repurchased 2,822,402 shares of its common stock, pursuant to the repurchase plan. The shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of $ 42.53 , for a total payment of $ 120.1 million . The Company's common stock repurchase program was renewed through December 2020, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an additional $ 250.0 million of its outstanding common stock. 

Cash Dividend 

During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company's Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $ 0.25 per share of common stock, totaling $ 51.3 million . 

Treasury Shares 

Treasury share purchases represent shares surrendered to the Company equal in value to the statutory payroll tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of employee restricted stock awards. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company purchased treasury shares of 210,657 at a weighted average price of $ 45.80 per share, compared to 223,125 shares at a weighted average price per share of $ 57.88 in 2018 , and 269,865 shares at a weighted average price per share of $ 51.16 in 2017 .

12. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

The Company is a party to various derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are contracts between two or more parties that have a notional amount and an underlying variable, require a small or no initial investment, and allow for the net settlement of positions. A derivative&#8217;s notional amount serves as the basis for the payment provision of the contract and takes the form of units, such as shares or dollars. A derivative&#8217;s underlying variable is a specified interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index, or other variable. The interaction between the notional amount and the underlying variable determines the number of units to be exchanged between the parties and influences the fair value of the derivative contract. 

The primary type of derivatives that the Company uses are interest rate swaps. Generally, these instruments are used to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk and meet client financing and hedging needs. 

Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. These agreements allow the Company to settle all derivative contracts held with the same counterparty on a net basis, and to offset net derivative positions with related cash collateral, where applicable. 

As of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the Company does not have any outstanding cash flow hedges. 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships 

The Company utilizes derivatives that have been designated as part of a hedge relationship in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance to minimize the exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates and volatility of net interest income and EVE to interest rate fluctuations. The primary derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are interest rate swaps, which convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. 

The Company has entered into pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed rate loans. As a result, the Company receives variable-rate interest payments in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts. 

The Company has also entered into receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps, designated as fair value hedges on its fixed rate subordinated debt offerings. As a result, the Company is paying a floating rate of three month LIBOR plus 3.16% and is receiving semi-annual fixed payments of 5.00 % to match the payments on the $ 150.0 million subordinated debt. For the fair value hedge on the Parent's $ 175.0 million subordinated debentures issued on June 16, 2016, the Company is paying a floating rate of three- month LIBOR plus 3.25% and is receiving quarterly fixed payments at 6.25 % to match the payments on the debt. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships 

Management also enters into certain foreign exchange derivative contracts and back-to-back interest rate swaps that are not designated as accounting hedges. Foreign exchange derivative contracts include spot, forward, and forward window contracts. The purpose of these derivative contracts is to mitigate foreign currency risk on transactions entered into or on behalf of customers. Contracts with customers, along with the related derivative trades the Company places, are both remeasured at fair value, and are referred to as economic hedges since they economically offset the Company's exposure. The Company's back-to-back interest rate swaps are used to manage long-term interest rate risk. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the following amounts are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

##TABLE_END For the Company's derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings in the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. For loans, the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in interest income and for subordinated debt, the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in interest expense. 

Fair Values, Volume of Activity, and Gain/Loss Information Related to Derivative Instruments 

The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments on a gross and net basis as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . The change in the notional amounts of these derivatives from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019 indicates the volume of the Company's derivative transaction activity during these periods. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle all derivative contracts with the same counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. Where master netting agreements are not in effect or are not enforceable under bankruptcy laws, the Company does not adjust those derivative amounts with counterparties. The fair value of derivative contracts, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements, is included in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as indicated in the following table:

Counterparty Credit Risk 

Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element of credit risk. This risk is measured as the expected positive replacement value of the contracts. Management generally enters into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with the same counterparty. Additionally, management monitors counterparty credit risk exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on the Company's total credit exposure across all product types. In general, the Company has a zero credit threshold with regard to derivative exposure with counterparties. Management reviews the Company's collateral positions on a daily basis and exchanges collateral with counterparties in accordance with standard ISDA documentation and other related agreements. The Company generally holds collateral in the form of cash deposits or highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or government-sponsored enterprises, such as GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC. The total collateral netted against net derivative liabilities totaled $ 55.5 million at December 31, 2019 , $ 44.9 million at December 31, 2018 , and $ 53.6 million at December 31, 2017 .

Credit Risk Contingent Features 

Management has entered into certain derivative contracts that require the Company to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position. Conversely, the counterparties may be required to post collateral when these contracts are in a net asset position. The amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and exposure thresholds. As of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containing collateral posting provisions) held by the Company that were in a net liability position totaled $ 55.5 million , $ 44.9 million , and $ 53.6 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company was in an over-collateralized net position of $ 29.2 million after considering $ 84.7 million of collateral held in the form of cash and securities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company was in an over-collateralized position of $ 7.6 million and $ 25.0 million , respectively.

##TABLE_END

For the year s ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 the Company's effective tax rate was 17.39 % , 14.61 % , and 27.96 % , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is due primarily to management's decision during the third quarter of 2018 to carryback its 2017 federal NOLs. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 is due primarily to the decrease in the federal statutory rate effective in 2018, a reduction in excise taxes, and management's decision to carryback its 2017 federal NOLs. The reduction in excise taxes from 2017 to 2018 resulted from not deferring WAB's 2018 dividend from BW Real Estate as was the case in 2017. The Company's 2017 federal NOLs resulted from the acceleration of deductions into and deferral of revenue from 2017. As the federal income tax rate was higher in the years to which the carryback is applicable, a larger tax benefit results from the decision to carryback the 2017 federal NOLs, rather than carry forward these losses to future taxable years. 

The cumulative tax effects of the primary temporary differences are shown in the following table:

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

Upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, a lease liability DTA and a right of use asset DTL were established and totaled $9.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively. While there may be significant changes in the separate DTA and DTL balances of these two items, the aggregate effect of these two changes will generally offset and therefore are not discussed as significant changes to the net deferred balance. 

##TABLE_END Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be reversed. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. 

Net deferred tax assets decreased $ 14.0 million to $ 18.0 million from December 31, 2018 . This overall decrease in net deferred tax assets was primarily the result of the increases in the fair market value of AFS securities. In addition, there was a large decrease to the overall estimated loss reserve, which was largely offset by increases to DTLs related to premises and equipment and income associated with tax credits for lease pass-through transactions (50(d) income). 

Although realization is not assured, the Company believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $ 18.0 million at December 31, 2019 is more-likely-than-not based on expectations as to future taxable income and based on available tax planning strategies that could be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryover from expiring. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has no deferred tax valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had a deferred tax valuation allowance of $ 2.4 million related to net capital loss carryovers. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s gross federal NOL carryovers, all of which are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the IRC, totaled $ 45.8 million , for which a deferred tax asset of $ 5.5 million has been recorded, reflecting the expected benefit of these federal NOL carryovers remaining after application of the Section 382 limitation. The Company also has varying gross amounts of state NOL carryovers, primarily in Arizona. The gross Arizona NOL carryovers totaled approximately $ 2.2 million . A deferred tax asset of $ 0.2 million has been recorded to reflect the expected benefit of all state NOL carryovers remaining. If not utilized, a portion of the federal and state NOL carryovers will begin to expire in 2024. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had no federal tax credit carryovers and $ 1.4 million of state tax credit carryovers. If not utilized, a portion of the state tax credit carryovers will begin to expire in 2023. In management&#8217;s opinion, it is more-likely-than-not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of the deferred tax benefits related to these NOL and tax credit carryovers. 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various states. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015 . 

When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that most positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets along with any associated interest and penalties payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. 

The total gross activity of unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company's uncertain tax positions are shown in the following table:

During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company added a new current year position, which resulted in a tax detriment of $0.8 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, net of associated deferred tax benefits, that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $ 1.1 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively. The Company anticipates that $ 0.1 million of the unrecognized tax benefits will be resolved within the next 12 months. 

During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the Company recognized no additional amounts for interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company has accrued total liabilities of $ 0.1 million for penalties and no amounts for interest. 

LIHTC and renewable energy projects 

As discussed in " Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," the Company holds ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in affordable housing and renewable energy projects. These investments are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits and deductions. The limited liability entities are considered to be VIEs; however, as a limited partner, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and is not required to consolidate these entities. 

At December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s exposure to loss as a result of its involvement in these entities was limited to $ 487.3 million , which reflects the Company&#8217;s recorded investment in these projects, net of certain unfunded capital commitments, and previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the Company did not provide financial or other support to these entities that was not contractually required. 

Investments in LIHTC and renewable energy total $ 409.4 million and $ 369.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Unfunded LIHTC and renewable energy obligations are included as part of other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and total $ 191.0 million and $ 196.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , $ 41.5 million , $ 35.9 million , and $ 25.4 million of amortization related to LIHTC investments was recognized as a component of income tax expense, respectively. 

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit 

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. They involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Lines of credit are obligations to lend money to a borrower. Credit risk arises when the borrower's current financial condition may indicate less ability to pay than when the commitment was originally made. In the case of letters of credit, the risk arises from the potential failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of a contract. In such a situation, the third party might draw on the letter of credit to pay for completion of the contract and the Company would look to its customer to repay these funds with interest. To minimize the risk, the Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it would for a loan to that customer. 

Letters of credit and financial guarantees are commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in borrowing arrangements. The Company generally has recourse to recover from the customer any amounts paid under the guarantees. Typically, letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year . 

A summary of the contractual amounts for unfunded commitments and letters of credit are as follows:

##TABLE_END

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided that there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company enters into credit arrangements that generally provide for the termination of advances in the event of a covenant violation or other event of default. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer&#8217;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the party. The commitments are collateralized by the same types of assets used as loan collateral. 

The Company has exposure to credit losses from unfunded commitments and letters of credit. As funds have not been disbursed on these commitments, they are not reported as loans outstanding. Credit losses related to these commitments are included in other liabilities as a separate loss contingency and are not included in the allowance for credit losses reported in " Note 3. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses " of these Consolidated Financial Statements. This loss contingency for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was $ 9.0 million and $ 8.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Changes to this liability are adjusted through other expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. 

Concentrations of Lending Activities 

The Company&#8217;s lending activities are driven in large part by the customers served in the market areas where the Company has branch offices in the states of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Despite the geographic concentration of lending activities, the Company does not have a single external customer from which it derives 10% or more of its revenues. The Company monitors concentrations within four broad categories: geography, industry, product, and collateral. The Company's loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the CRE market. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , CRE related loans accounted for approximately 45 % and 49 % of total loans, respectively. Substantially all of these loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75 % . Approximately 31 % and 36 % of these CRE loans, excluding construction and land loans, were owner occupied as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Contingencies 

The Company is involved in various lawsuits of a routine nature that are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business. Expenses are being incurred in connection with these lawsuits, but in the opinion of management, based in part on consultation with outside legal counsel, the resolution of these lawsuits and associated defense costs will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

16. FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING 

The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction occurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. In estimating fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach, and/or the cost approach. Such valuation techniques are consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 825 are described in " Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally-developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company&#8217;s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Company&#8217;s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Company&#8217;s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore, the reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance sheet date may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. A more detailed description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value is set forth below. Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the end of the month following the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 

Under ASC 825, the Company elected the FVO treatment for junior subordinated debt issued by WAL. This election is irrevocable and results in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on these items at each reporting date. These unrealized gains and losses are recognized as part of other comprehensive income rather than earnings. The Company did not elect FVO treatment for the junior subordinated debt assumed in the Bridge Capital Holdings acquisition. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , unrealized gains and losses from fair value changes on junior subordinated debt were as follows:

Fair value on a recurring basis 

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following: 

AFS securities: Securities classified as AFS are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include quoted prices in active markets, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the bond&#8217;s terms and conditions, among other things. 

Equity securities: Preferred stock and CRA investments are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs. 

Independent pricing service: The Company's independent pricing service provides pricing information on the majority of the Company's Level 1 and 2 AFS securities. For a small subset of securities, other pricing sources are used, including observed prices on publicly-traded securities and dealer quotes. Management independently evaluates the fair value measurements received from the Company's third-party pricing service through multiple review steps. First, management reviews what has transpired in the marketplace with respect to interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, and mortgage rates, among other things, and develops an expectation of changes to the securities' valuations from the previous quarter. Then, management selects a sample of investment securities and compares the values provided by its primary third-party pricing service to the market values obtained from secondary sources, including other pricing services and safekeeping statements, and evaluates those with notable variances. In instances where there are discrepancies in pricing from various sources and management expectations, management may manually price securities using currently observed market data to determine whether they can develop similar prices or may utilize bid information from broker dealers. Any remaining discrepancies between management's review and the prices provided by the vendor are discussed with the vendor and/or the Company's other valuation advisors. 

Interest rate swaps: Interest rate swaps are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The Company obtains dealer quotations to value its interest rate swaps. 

Junior subordinated debt: The Company estimates the fair value of its junior subordinated debt using a discounted cash flow model which incorporates the effect of the Company&#8217;s own credit risk in the fair value of the liabilities (Level 3). The Company&#8217;s cash flow assumptions are based on contractual cash flows as the Company anticipates that it will pay the debt according to its contractual terms. 

The fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis was determined using the following inputs as of the periods presented:

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was the implied credit risk for the Company, calculated as the difference between the 15-year 'BB' rated financial index over the corresponding swap index. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company estimates the discount rate at 5.09 % , which represents an implied credit spread of 3.18 % plus three-month LIBOR ( 1.91 % ). As of December 31, 2018 , the Company estimated the discount rate at 7.82 % , which was a 5.01 % credit spread plus three-month LIBOR ( 2.81 % ). 

Fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. That is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The following table presents such assets carried on the balance sheet by caption and by level within the ASC 825 hierarchy:

Impaired loans: The specific reserves for collateral dependent impaired loans are based on collateral value, net of estimated disposition costs and other identified quantitative inputs. Collateral value is determined based on independent third-party appraisals or internally-developed discounted cash flow analyses. Appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches, including comparable sales and the income approach. Fair value is determined, where possible, using market prices derived from an appraisal or evaluation, which are considered to be Level 2. However, certain assumptions and unobservable inputs are often used by the appraiser, therefore qualifying the assets as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In addition, when adjustments are made to an appraised value to reflect various factors such as the age of the appraisal or known changes in the market or the collateral, such valuation inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurement is categorized as a Level 3 measurement. Internal discounted cash flow analyses are also utilized to estimate the fair value of impaired loans, which considers internally-developed, unobservable inputs such as discount rates, default rates, and loss severity. 

Total Level 3 impaired loans had an estimated fair value of $ 110.3 million and $ 92.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Impaired loans with a specific valuation allowance had a gross estimated fair value of $ 21.0 million and $ 1.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which was reduced by a specific valuation allowance of $ 2.8 million and $ 0.7 million , respectively. 

Other assets acquired through foreclosure: Other assets acquired through foreclosure consist of properties acquired as a result of, or in-lieu-of, foreclosure. These assets are initially reported at the fair value determined by independent appraisals using appraised value less estimated cost to sell. Such properties are generally re-appraised every 12 months. There is risk for subsequent volatility. Costs relating to the development or improvement of the assets are capitalized and costs relating to holding the assets are charged to expense. 

Fair value is determined, where possible, using market prices derived from an appraisal or evaluation, which are considered to be Level 2. However, certain assumptions and unobservable inputs are often used by the appraiser, therefore qualifying the assets as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. When significant adjustments are based on unobservable inputs, such as when a current appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the resulting fair value measurement has been categorized as a Level 3 measurement. The Company had $ 13.9 million and $ 17.9 million of such assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Credit vs. non-credit losses 

Under the provisions of ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities , OTTI is separated into the amount of total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total impairment related to all other factors is recognized in OCI. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the Company determined that there were no securities that experienced credit losses. 

There is no OTTI balance recognized in comprehensive income as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

##TABLE_END

Interest rate risk 

The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk to the Company&#8217;s earnings and capital from changes in interest rate levels) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments, as well as its future net interest income will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. 

Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the Company's change in EVE and net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to EVE and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by the BOD, the BOD may direct management to adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within BOD-approved limits. 

WAB has an ALCO charged with managing interest rate risk within the BOD-approved limits. Limits are structured to preclude an interest rate risk profile that does not conform to both management and BOD risk tolerances without ALCO approval. There 

is also ALCO reporting at the Parent level for reviewing interest rate risk for the Company, which gets reported to the BOD and its Finance and Investment Committee. 

Fair value of commitments 

The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 is insignificant. Loan commitments on which the committed interest rates are less than the current market rate are also insignificant at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

17. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded the well-capitalized thresholds, as defined by the federal banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables as of the periods indicated:

18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

The Company has a qualified 401(k) employee benefit plan for all eligible employees. Participants are able to defer between 1 % and 75 % (up to a maximum of $ 19,000 for those under 50 years of age and up to a maximum of $25,000 for those over 50 years of age in 2019 ) of their annual compensation. The Company may elect to match a discretionary amount each year, which is 75 % of the first 6 % of the participant&#8217;s compensation deferred into the plan. The Company&#8217;s contributions to this plan total $ 6.2 million , $ 5.6 million , and $ 3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. 

In addition, the Company maintains a non-qualified 401(k) restoration plan for the benefit of executives of the Company and certain affiliates. Participants are able to defer a portion of their annual salary and receive a matching contribution based primarily on the contribution structure in effect under the Company&#8217;s 401(k) plan, but without regard to certain statutory limitations applicable under the 401(k) plan. The Company&#8217;s total contribution to the restoration plan was $ 0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . 

In connection with the Bridge acquisition, the Company assumed Bridge's SERP, an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan. The SERP provides retirement benefits to certain Bridge officers based on years of service and final average salary. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for this plan. 

The following table reflects the accumulated benefit obligation and funded status of the SERP:

21. SEGMENTS 

The Company's reportable segments are aggregated based primarily on geographic location, services offered, and markets served. The Company's regional segments, which include Arizona, Nevada, Southern California, and Northern California, provide full service banking and related services to their respective markets. The operations from the regional segments correspond to the following banking divisions: ABA in Arizona, BON and FIB in Nevada, TPB in Southern California, and Bridge in Northern California. 

The Company's NBL segments provide specialized banking services to niche markets. The Company's NBL reportable segments include HOA Services, Public &#38; Nonprofit Finance, Technology &#38; Innovation, HFF, and Other NBLs. These NBLs are managed centrally and are broader in geographic scope than the Company's other segments, though still predominately located within the Company's core market areas. 

The Corporate &#38; Other segment consists of corporate-related items, income and expense items not allocated to the Company's other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations. 

The Company's segment reporting process begins with the assignment of all loan and deposit accounts directly to the segments where these products are originated and/or serviced. Equity capital is assigned to each segment based on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities. With the exception of goodwill, which is assigned a 100% weighting, equity capital allocations ranged from 0% to 12% during the year, with a funds credit provided for the use of this equity as a funding source. Any excess or deficient equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Net interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segment to the extent that the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income is recorded in each segment on a TEB with a corresponding increase in income tax expense, which is eliminated in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Further, net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. A net user of funds has lending/investing in excess of deposits/borrowings and a net provider of funds has deposits/borrowings in excess of lending/investing. A segment that is a user of funds is charged for the use of funds, while a provider of funds is credited through funds transfer pricing, which is determined based on the average life of the assets or liabilities in the portfolio. 

Net income amounts for each reportable segment is further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, average loan balances, and average deposit balances. These types of expenses include information technology, operations, human resources, finance, risk management, credit administration, legal, and marketing. 

Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are adjusted in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

The following is a summary of operating segment balance sheet information for the periods indicated:

22. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 

ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , requires revenue to be recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, except for contracts that are specifically excluded from its scope. The majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue streams including interest income, credit and debit card fees, income from equity investments, including warrants and SBIC equity income, income from bank owned life insurance, foreign currency income, lending related income, and gains and losses on sales of investment securities are outside the scope of ASC 606. Revenue streams including service charges and fees, interchange fees on credit and debit cards, and success fees are within the scope of ASC 606. 

Disaggregation of Revenue 

The following table represents a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers for the periods indicated along with the reportable segment for each revenue category:

##TABLE_END Performance Obligations 

Many of the services the Company performs for its customers are ongoing, and either party may cancel at any time. The fees for these contracts are dependent upon various underlying factors, such as customer deposit balances, and as such may be considered variable. The Company&#8217;s performance obligations for these services are satisfied as the services are rendered and payment is collected on a monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual basis. Other contracts with customers are for services to be provided at a point in time, and fees are recognized at the time such services are rendered. The Company had no material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2019 . The revenue streams within the scope of ASC 606 are described in further detail below. 

Service Charges and Fees 

The Company performs deposit account services for its customers, which include analysis and treasury management services, use of safe deposit boxes, check upcharges, and other ancillary services. The depository arrangements the Company holds with its customers are considered day-to-day contracts with ongoing renewals and optional purchases, and as such, the contract duration does not extend beyond the services performed. Due to the short-term nature of such contracts, the Company generally recognizes revenue for deposit related fees as services are rendered. From time to time, the Company may waive certain fees for its customers. The Company considers historical experience when recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, and may reduce the transaction price to account for fee waivers or refunds. 

Debit and Credit Card Interchange 

When a credit or debit card issued by the Company is used to purchase goods or services from a merchant, the Company earns an interchange fee. The Company considers the merchant its customer in these transactions as the Company provides the merchant with the service of enabling the cardholder to purchase the merchant&#8217;s goods or services with increased convenience, and it enables the merchants to transact with a class of customer that may not have access to sufficient funds at the time of purchase. The Company acts as an agent to the payment network by providing nightly settlement services between the network and the merchant. This transmission of data and funds represents the Company&#8217;s performance obligation and is performed nightly. As the payment network 

is in direct control of setting the rates and the Company is acting as an agent, the interchange fee is recorded net of expenses as the services are provided. 

Success Fees 

Success fees are one-time fees detailed as part of certain loan agreements and are earned immediately upon occurrence of a triggering event. Examples of triggering events include a borrower obtaining its next round of funding, an acquisition, or completion of a public offering. Success fees are variable consideration as the transaction price can vary and is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. As the consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside of the Company&#8217;s influence and uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for an extended period of time, the variable consideration is constrained and is not recognized until the achievement of the triggering event. 

Principal versus Agent Considerations 

When more than one party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, ASC 606 requires the Company to determine whether it is the principal or an agent in these transactions by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. An entity is a principal and therefore records revenue on a gross basis, if it controls a promised good or service before transferring that good or service to the customer. An entity is an agent and records as revenue the net amount it retains for its agency services if its role is to arrange for another entity to provide the goods or services. The Company most commonly acts as a principal and records revenue on a gross basis, except in certain circumstances. As an example, revenues earned from interchange fees, in which the Company acts as an agent, are recorded as non-interest income, net of the related expenses paid to the principal. 

Contract Balances 

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of cash settlements or invoicing to customers. The Company records contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, when payments from customers are received or due in advance of providing services to customers. The Company generally receives payments for its services during the period or at the time services are provided, and therefore does not have material contract liability balances at period-end. The Company records contract assets or receivables when revenue is recognized prior to receipt of cash from the customer. Accounts receivable totals $ 1.6 million and $ 1.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, and are presented in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
