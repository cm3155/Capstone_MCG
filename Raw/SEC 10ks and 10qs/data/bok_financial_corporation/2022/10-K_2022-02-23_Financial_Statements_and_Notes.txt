Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of BOK Financial Corporation 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited BOK Financial Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, BOK Financial Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of BOK Financial Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of BOK Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BOK Financial Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standard 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for credit losses in 2020. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

##TABLE_START Allowance for credit losses Description of the Matter 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio totaled $20.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, and the associated allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $289.4 million. A $100 million negative provision for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. As discussed in Note 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, management&#8217;s estimate for the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio represents the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments they do not expect to collect over the asset&#8217;s contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The allowance for credit losses consists of specific allowances attributed to certain individual loans, generally nonaccruing loans, with dissimilar risk characteristics that have not yet been charged down to amounts they expect to recover, general allowances for estimated credit losses on pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics, and qualitative reserves with the estimated impact of factors that are not captured in the modeled results or historical experience. 

Auditing management&#8217;s estimate of the ACL and related provision for credit losses was complex due to the allowance models used, high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management&#8217;s development of forecasts of future economic conditions (&#8220;economic scenarios&#8221;), probability weighting of economic scenarios, and qualitative reserves used in the general allowance. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the ACL process, including, among others, controls over the development, operation, and monitoring of economic scenarios, probability weighting of economic scenarios and qualitative reserves used in the allowance results. 

We involved EY specialists in testing management&#8217;s models including evaluating model methodology, model performance and testing key modeling assumptions as well as controls covering the economic scenarios used by the ACL models. Additionally, with the support of EY specialists, we assessed the economic scenarios and related probability weights by evaluating management&#8217;s methodology and agreeing a sample of key economic variables used to external sources. We also performed various sensitivity analyses and analytical procedures, including comparison of a sample of the key economic variables to alternative external sources and historical statistics. 

With respect to general ACL models, with the support of EY specialists, we evaluated model design and re-performed the calculation for a sample of models. We also tested the appropriateness of key inputs and assumptions used in these models by agreeing a sample of inputs to internal sources. 

We evaluated the overall ACL amount, including model estimates, qualitative reserves, and whether the recorded ACL appropriately reflects expected credit losses. We performed analytical procedures on the ACL, charge-off and delinquency rates, and coverage ratios of the allowance. Our audit response also included specific substantive tests of management&#8217;s process to measure qualitative reserves, including those related to the significant judgments made by management. We compared calculations to industry peer data and compared qualitative reserves to prior periods and prior economic cycles. We also evaluated if the qualitative reserves were applied based on a comprehensive framework and that all available information was considered, well-documented, and consistently applied. We searched for and evaluated information that corroborates or contradicts management&#8217;s economic scenarios and related probability weights as well as identification and measurement of qualitative reserves.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(1) Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

&#160; 

The Consolidated Financial Statements of BOK Financial Corporation (&#8220;BOK Financial&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), including interpretations of U.S. GAAP issued by federal banking regulators and general practices of the banking industry. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BOK Financial and its subsidiaries, principally BOKF, NA, BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Private Wealth, Inc., BOK Financial Insurance, Inc. and Cavanal Hill Distributors, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of operations of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) when BOK Financial is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Variable interest entities are generally defined as entities that either do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without support from other parties or whose equity investors lack a controlling financial interest. Determination that the Company is the primary beneficiary considers the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the variable interest or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest that could be significant to the variable interest. 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 

Nature of Operations 

BOK Financial, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide range of financial services to commercial and industrial customers, other financial institutions, municipalities, and consumers. These services include depository and cash management; lending and lease financing; mortgage banking; securities brokerage, trading and underwriting; and personal and corporate trust. 

BOKF, NA operates as Bank of Oklahoma primarily in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metropolitan areas of the state of Oklahoma and Bank of Texas primarily in the Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas of the state of Texas. In addition, BOKF, NA does business as BOK Financial in the metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Arizona; Northwest Arkansas; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Missouri/Kansas; and as Bank of Albuquerque in Albuquerque, New Mexico. BOKF, NA also operates the TransFund electronic funds network, Cavanal Hill Investment Management, and BOK Financial Asset Management, Inc. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of BOK Financial's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates of future economic activities, including loan collectability, loss contingencies, prepayments and cash flows from customer accounts. These estimates are based upon current conditions and information available to management. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. 

Acquisitions 

&#160; 

Assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The purchase price includes consideration paid at closing and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration that will be paid in the future, subject to achieving defined performance criteria. Premiums and discounts assigned to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are amortized over the lives of the acquired assets and liabilities on either an individual instrument or pool basis. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Acquired loans with more than an insignificant credit deterioration since inception are recorded at fair value plus a gross-up amount which is offset by an allowance for credit losses. Acquired loans without a more than insignificant credit deterioration since inception are recorded at fair value. An allowance for credit losses is recognized through a provision for credit losses, similar to origination loans. 

The Consolidated Statements of Earnings include the results of operations from the acquisition date. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

&#160; 

Goodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1st or more frequently if conditions indicate that impairment may have occurred. The evaluation of possible goodwill impairment involves significant judgment based upon short-term and long-term projections of future performance. Reporting units are defined by the Company as significant lines of business within each operating segment. This definition is consistent with the manner in which the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the Company and makes decisions concerning the allocation of resources. 

During the evaluation for impairment, management qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value. Reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements plus goodwill. This assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, the financial and stock performance of the Company and other relevant factors. Specifically, the analysis may include: 

&#8226; General economic conditions including overall economic activity, consumer spending and mobility, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and duration and severity of any current market moving instability. 

&#8226; Global health concerns including ongoing pandemics or potential for widespread health issues, the future course of a pandemic and the potential for medical advances. 

&#8226; Regional economic conditions including demand for oil and price stability of oil, other overarching conditions that may be affecting any of the Company's primary states such as weather or other catastrophes, pandemics and health related lockdowns, or other state mandates. 

&#8226; Industry conditions including federal funds rate movement by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate environment and the resulting effect on net interest revenue and operating revenue, and regulatory mandates that hinder or provide relief to the financial services industry. 

&#8226; Company specific conditions including current and forecasted income, changes in stock price, the Company's stock price compared to peers and other indexes, book value per share compared to fair value per share, goodwill compared to total shareholders' equity, current capital and liquidity position, demand for products and services, health of the loan portfolio and other credit related factors, and current credit ratings with the ratings agencies, and regulatory ratings. 

&#8226; Reporting unit performance and forecasts including any event that may significantly impact a reporting unit. 

If management concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired, a quantitative impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method. Goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. 

Both the qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis require significant management judgment, including estimates of changes in future economic conditions and their underlying causes and duration, the reasonableness and effectiveness of management's responses to those changes, changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policies, and fair value measurements based largely on significant unobservable inputs. The results of these judgments may have a significant impact on the Company's reported results of operations. 

See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for breakout of goodwill by reporting unit. 

Intangible assets are generally composed of customer relationships, naming rights, non-compete agreements and core deposit premiums. They are amortized using accelerated or straight-line methods, as appropriate, over the estimated benefit periods. These periods range from 3 years to 20 years. The net book values of identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when economic conditions indicate impairment may exist. 

&#160; 

Cash Equivalents 

&#160; 

Due from banks, funds sold (generally federal funds sold for one day ), resell agreements (which generally mature within one day to 30 days) and investments in money market funds are considered cash equivalents. 

Securities 

&#160; 

Securities are identified as trading, investment (held to maturity) or available for sale at the time of purchase based upon the intent of management, liquidity and capital requirements, regulatory limitations and other relevant factors. Trading securities, which are acquired for profit through resale, are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in current period earnings. Investment securities are carried at amortized cost. Amortization is computed by methods that approximate level yield and is adjusted for changes in prepayment estimates. Securities identified as available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of deferred income taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Available for sale securities are separately identified as pledged to creditors if the creditor has the right to sell or re-pledge the collateral. 

The purchase or sale of securities is recognized on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are based upon specific identification of the security sold. A receivable or payable is recognized for subsequent transaction settlement. 

&#160; 

On a quarterly basis, the Company performs separate evaluations of debt investment and available for sale securities for the presence of impairment. We assess whether impairment is present on an individual security basis when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost. 

Management determines whether it intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell impaired securities. This determination considers current and forecasted liquidity requirements and securities portfolio management. If the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the impaired debt security, a charge is recognized against earnings for the entire unrealized loss. For all impaired debt securities for which there is no intent or expected requirement to sell, the evaluation considers all available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that all amounts due would not be collected according to the security's contractual terms and whether there is any impairment attributable to credit-related factors. If an impairment exists, the amount attributed to credit-related factors is measured and an allowance for credit loss is recognized. Declines in fair value that are not recorded in the allowance are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of taxes. 

BOK Financial may elect to carry certain securities that are not held for trading purposes at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. These securities are held with the intent that gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights or other financial instruments. 

Restricted equity securities represent equity interests the Company is required to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Restricted equity securities are carried at cost as these securities do not have a readily determined fair value because ownership of these shares is restricted and they lack a market. 

The fair value of our securities portfolio is generally based on a single price for each financial instrument provided to us by a third-party pricing service determined by one or more of the following: 

&#8226; Quoted prices for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities in active markets; 

&#8226; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 

&#8226; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and 

&#8226; Other inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs. 

The underlying methods used by the third-party pricing services are considered in determining the primary inputs used to determine fair values. We evaluate the methodologies employed by the third-party pricing services by comparing the price provided by the pricing service with other sources, including brokers' quotes, sales or purchases of similar instruments and discounted cash flows to establish a basis for reliance on the pricing service values. Significant differences between the pricing service provided value and other sources are discussed with the pricing service to understand the basis for their values. Based on all observable inputs, management may adjust prices obtained from third-party pricing services to more appropriately reflect the prices that would be received to sell assets or paid to transfer liabilities in orderly transactions in the current market. 

Derivative Instruments 

&#160; 

Derivative instruments may be used by the Company as part of its internal risk management programs or may be offered to customers. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are generally reported in income as they occur. The determination of fair value of derivative instruments considers changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Fair values for exchange-traded contracts are based on quoted prices in an active market for identical instruments. Fair values for over-the-counter contracts are generated internally using third-party valuation models. Inputs used in third-party valuation models to determine fair values are considered significant other observable inputs. Credit risk is also considered in determining fair value. Deterioration in the credit rating of customers or other counterparties reduces the fair value of asset contracts. Deterioration of our credit rating could decrease the fair value of our derivative liabilities. 

When bilateral netting agreements or similar agreements exist between the Company and its counterparties that create a single legal claim or obligation to pay or receive the net amount in settlement of the individual derivative contracts, the Company reports derivative assets and liabilities on a net by derivative contract by counterparty basis. 

Derivative contracts may also require the Company to provide or receive cash margin as collateral for derivative assets and liabilities. Derivative assets and liabilities are reported net of cash margin when certain conditions are met. In addition, derivative contracts executed with customers under Customer Risk Management Programs may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer. Access to collateral in the event of default is reasonably assured. 

BOK Financial offers programs that permit its customers to manage various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural products, interest rates and foreign exchange rates with derivative contracts. Customers may also manage interest rate risk through interest rate swaps used by the borrower to modify interest rate terms of their loans. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and BOK Financial. Offsetting contracts are executed between BOK Financial and other selected counterparties to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or fee paid to BOK Financial as profit and compensation for administrative costs and credit risk which is recognized over the life of the contracts and included in Other Operating Revenue - Brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

BOK Financial may offer derivative instruments such as to-be-announced U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities to mortgage banking customers to enable them to manage their market risk or to mitigate the Company's market risk of holding trading securities. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments for trading purposes or used to mitigate the market risk of holding trading securities are included in Other Operating Revenue - Brokerage and trading revenue. 

BOK Financial may use derivative instruments in managing its interest rate sensitivity, as part of its economic hedge of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in managing interest rate sensitivity and as part of its economic hedge of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are included in Other Operating Revenue - Gain (loss) on derivatives, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

BOK Financial also enters into mortgage loan commitments that are considered derivative contracts. Forward sales contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments are used to economically hedge these mortgage loan commitments as well as mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan commitments, forward sales contracts, and residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are reported in Other Operating Revenue - Mortgage banking revenue. 

Loans 

&#160; 

Loans are either secured or unsecured based on the type of loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Repayment is generally expected from cash flow or proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrower. BOK Financial is exposed to risk of loss on loans due to the borrower's financial difficulties, which may arise from any number of factors, including problems within the respective industry or local economic conditions. Access to collateral, in the event of borrower default, is reasonably assured through adherence to applicable lending laws and through sound lending standards and credit review procedures. Accounting policies for all loans, excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, are as follows. 

Interest is accrued at the applicable interest rate on the outstanding principal amount. Loans are placed on nonaccruing status when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is uncertain. Internally risk graded loans are individually evaluated for nonaccruing status quarterly. Non-risk graded loans are generally placed on nonaccruing status when 90 days or more past due or within 60 days of being notified of the borrower's bankruptcy filing. Interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against interest income when the loan is placed on nonaccruing status. Payments received on nonaccruing loans are applied to principal or recognized as interest income, according to management's judgment as to the collectability of principal. Loans may be returned to accruing status when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal and interest, including principal previously charged off, is probable based on improvements in the borrower's financial condition or a sustained period of performance. 

For loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, discounts are accreted on either an individual basis for loans with unique characteristics or on a pool basis for groups of homogeneous loans. Accretion is discontinued when a loan with an individually attributed discount is placed on nonaccruing status. 

Loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may be modified in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). TDRs are generally classified as nonaccruing, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Modifications generally consist of extension of payment terms or interest rate concessions and may result either voluntarily through negotiations with the borrower or involuntarily through court order. Payment deferrals of up to six months are generally considered to be short-term modifications. Generally, principal and accrued but unpaid interest is not voluntarily forgiven. 

Performing loans may be renewed under the then current collateral, debt service ratio and other underwriting standards. Nonaccruing loans may also be renewed and will remain classified as nonaccruing. 

Occasionally, loans, other than residential mortgage loans, may be held for sale in order to manage credit concentration. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value with gains or losses recognized in gain (loss) on assets. 

All loans are charged-off when the loan balance or a portion of the loan balance is no longer supported by the paying capacity of the borrower or when the required cash flow is reduced in a TDR. The charge-off amount is determined through an evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated quarterly and charge-offs are taken in the quarter in which the loss is identified. Non-risk graded loans that are past due between 60 days and 180 days, based on the loan product type, are charged off. Loans to borrowers whose personal obligation has been discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings are charged off within 60 days of notice of the bankruptcy filing, regardless of payment status. 

Loan origination and commitment fees and direct loan acquisition and origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan or over the commitment period, as applicable. Amortization does not anticipate loan prepayments. Net unamortized fees are recognized in full at time of payoff. 

Qualifying residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have been sold into GNMA pools. Under certain performance conditions specified in government programs, the Company has the right, but not the obligation to repurchase loans from GNMA pools. These loans no longer qualify for sale accounting and are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Guaranteed loans are considered to be impaired because we do not expect to receive all principal and interest based on the loan's contractual terms. A portion of the principal balance continues to be guaranteed; however, interest accrues at a curtailed rate as specified in the programs. The carrying value of these loans is reduced based on an estimate of expected cash flows discounted at the original note rate plus a liquidity spread. Guaranteed loans may be modified in TDRs in accordance with U.S. government agency guidelines. Interest continues to accrue at the modified rate. Guaranteed loans may either be resold into GNMA pools after a performance period specified by the programs or foreclosed and conveyed to the guarantors. 

Loans are disaggregated into portfolio segments and further disaggregated into classes. The portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops and documents a systematic method for determining its Allowance for Credit Losses. Classes are based on the risk characteristics of the loans and the Company's method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. 

Allowances for Credit Losses and Accrual for Off-balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loans Commitments 

BOK Financial&#8217;s accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of CECL as of January 1, 2020. Prior periods are not restated. Prior to January 1, 2020, general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses in accordance with accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

The allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of the amortized cost basis of loans that we do not expect to collect over the asset&#8217;s contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, including industry and product adjustments, is assessed quarterly by a senior management Allowance Committee. This review is based on an on-going evaluation of the estimated expected credit losses in the portfolio and on unused commitments to provide financing. A well-documented methodology has been developed and is applied by an independent Credit Administration department to assure consistency across the Company. 

The allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances attributed to certain individual loans, generally nonaccruing loans, with dissimilar risk characteristics that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover and general allowances for estimated credit losses on pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

When full collection of principal or interest is uncertain, the loan&#8217;s risk characteristics have changed, and we exclude the loan from the general allowance pool, typically designating it as nonaccruing. For these loans, a specific allowance reflects the expected credit loss. 

We measure specific allowances for loans excluded from the general allowance pool by an evaluation of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. For a non-collateral dependent loan, the specific allowance is the amount by which the loan&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds its net realizable value. We measure the specific allowance for collateral dependent loans as the amount by which the loan&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. When repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of collateral, we deduct estimated selling costs from the collateral&#8217;s fair value. Generally, third party appraisals that conform to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice serve as the basis for the fair value of real property held as collateral. These appraised values are on an &#8220;as-is&#8221; basis and generally are not adjusted by the Company. We obtain updated appraisals at least annually or more frequently if market conditions indicate collateral values may have declined. For energy loans, our internal staff of engineers generally determines collateral value of mineral rights based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. For real property held as collateral for other loans, third party appraisals that conform to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice generally serve as the basis for the fair value. These appraised values are on an &#8220;as-is&#8221; basis and generally are not adjusted by the Company. We obtain updated appraisals at least annually or more frequently if market conditions indicate collateral values may have declined. Our special assets staff generally determines the value of other collateral based on projected liquidation cash flows under current market conditions. We evaluate collateral values and available cash resources quarterly. Historical statistics may be used to estimate specific allowances in limited situations, such as when a collateral dependent loan is removed from the general allowance pool near the end of a reporting period until an appraisal of collateral value is received or a full assessment of future cash flows is completed. 

General allowances estimate expected credit losses on pools of loans sharing similar risk characteristics that are expected to occur over the loan&#8217;s estimated remaining life. The loan&#8217;s estimated remaining life represents the contractual term adjusted for amortization, estimates of prepayments, and borrower-owned extension options. Approximately 90 percent of the committed dollars in the loan portfolio is risk graded loans with general allowance model inputs that include probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default. Probability of default is based on the migration of loans from performing to nonperforming using historical life of loan analysis periods. Loss given default is based on the aggregate losses incurred, net of estimated recoveries. Exposure at default represents an estimate of the outstanding amount of credit exposure at the time a default may occur. 

Charge-off migration is used to calculate the general allowance for the majority of non-risk graded loans to individuals. The expected credit loss on less than 10% of the committed dollars in the portfolio is calculated using charge-off migration. 

The expected credit loss on approximately 1% of the committed dollars in the portfolio is calculated using a non-modeled approach. Specifically, the calculation applies a long-term net charge-off rate to the loan balances, adjusted for the weighted average remaining maturity of each portfolio. 

&#160; 

In estimating the expected credit losses for general allowances on performing risk-graded loans, each portfolio class is assigned relevant economic loss drivers which best explain variations in portfolio net loss rates. The probability of default estimates for each portfolio class are adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions. The result is applied to the exposure at default and loss given default to calculate the lifetime expected credit loss estimate. Selection of relevant economic loss drivers is re-evaluated periodically and involves statistical analysis as well as management judgment. The unemployment rate factors significantly in the allowance for loan losses calculation, affecting commercial and loans to individuals segments. Other primary factors impacting the commercial portfolio include BBB corporate spreads, real gross domestic product growth rate, and energy commodity prices. The primary commercial real estate variables are vacancy rate and BBB corporate spreads. In addition to the unemployment rate, the forecast for loans to individuals is tied to home price index. The forecasts may include regional economic factors when localized conditions diverge from national conditions. 

An Economic Forecast Committee, consisting of senior management with members largely independent of the allowance process develops a twelve-month forward-looking forecast for the relevant economic loss drivers. Management develops these forecasts based on external data as well as a view of future economic conditions, which may include adjustments for regional conditions. The forecast includes three economic scenarios and probability weights for each scenario. The base forecast represents management's view of the most likely outcome, while the downside forecast reflects reasonably possible worsening economic conditions, and the upside forecast projects reasonably possible improving conditions. 

At the end of the one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, we transition from shorter-term expected losses to long-term loss averages for the loan&#8217;s estimated remaining life. The difference between short-term loss forecasts and long-term loss averages is run-off over the reversion horizon, up to three years, depending on the forecasted economic scenarios. 

General allowances also consider the estimated impact of factors that are not captured in the modeled results or historical experience. These factors may increase or decrease modeled results by amounts determined by the Allowance Committee. Factors not captured in modeled results or historical experience may include for example, new lines of business, market conditions that have not been previously encountered, observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macro-economic factors, or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions. 

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk is maintained at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated losses associated with credit instruments that are not currently recognized as assets such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit or guarantees that are not unconditionally cancellable by the bank. This accrual is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The appropriateness of the accrual is determined in the same manner as the allowance for loan losses, with the added consideration of commitment usage over the remaining life for those loans that the bank can not unconditionally cancel. 

A provision for credit losses is charged against or credited to earnings in amounts necessary to maintain an appropriate Allowance for Credit Losses. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance when received. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets 

&#160; 

Real estate and other repossessed assets are acquired in partial or total forgiveness of loans. These assets are initially recognized at cost, which is determined by fair value at date of foreclosure less estimated disposal costs. They are subsequently carried at the lower of cost or current fair value less estimated disposal costs. Decreases in fair value below cost are recognized as asset-specific valuation allowances which may be reversed when supported by future increases in fair value. Subsequent increases in fair value may be used to reduce the valuation allowance but not below zero. 

Fair values of real estate are based on &#8220;as is&#8221; appraisals which are updated at least annually or more frequently for certain asset types or assets located in certain distressed markets. Fair values based on appraisals are generally considered to be based on significant other observable inputs. The Company also considers decreases in listing price and other relevant information in quarterly evaluations and reduces the carrying value of real estate and other repossessed assets when necessary. Fair values based on list prices and other relevant information are generally considered to be based on significant unobservable inputs. Additional costs incurred to complete real estate and other repossessed assets may increase the carrying value, up to current fair value based on &#8220;as completed&#8221; appraisals. The fair value of mineral rights included in repossessed assets is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs. Projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production, sales prices, operating expenses, severance, ad valorem taxes, capital costs and appropriate discount rate. Fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs. The value of other repossessed assets is generally determined by our special assets staff based on projected liquidation cash flows under current market conditions. 

Income generated by these assets is recognized as received. Operating expenses are recognized as incurred. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and other repossessed assets are based on the cash proceeds received less the cost basis of the asset, net of any valuation allowances. The estimated disposal costs of real estate and other repossessed assets are evaluated by the Company on an annual basis based on actual results. 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

&#160; 

BOK Financial regularly transfers financial assets as part of its mortgage banking activities and periodically may transfer other financial assets. Transfers are recorded as sales when the criteria for surrender of control are met. 

The Company has elected to carry certain residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value under the fair value option. Changes in fair value are recognized in net income as they occur. These loans are reported separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in fair value are recorded in Other Operating Revenue - Mortgage banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Fair value of conforming residential mortgage loans that will be sold to U.S. government agencies is based on sales commitments or market quotes considered Level 2 inputs. Fair value of mortgage loans that are unable to be sold to U.S. government agencies is based on Level 3 inputs using quoted prices of loans that are sold in securitization transactions with a liquidity discount applied. The fair value is corroborated with an independent third party on at least an annual basis. 

BOK Financial retains a repurchase obligation under underwriting representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans transferred and generally retains the right to service the loans. These are not credit obligations. The Company may incur a recourse obligation in limited circumstances. Separate accruals are recognized in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for repurchase and recourse obligations. These reserves reflect the estimated amount of probable loss the Company will incur as a result of repurchasing a loan, indemnifications, and other settlement resolutions. 

Repurchases of loans with an origination defect that are also credit impaired are considered collateral dependent and are initially recognized at net realizable value (appraised value less the cost to sell). The difference between unpaid principal balance and net realizable value is not accreted. Repurchases of loans with an origination defect that are not credit impaired are carried at fair value as of the repurchase date. Interest income continues to accrue on these loans and the discount is accreted over the estimated life of the loan. 

The Company may also choose to purchase GNMA loans once certain mandated delinquency criteria are met. The loans that are eligible and are chosen to be repurchased are initially recognized at fair value based on expected cash flows discounted using the average agency guaranteed debenture rates, average actual principal loss rates and liquidity premium. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

&#160; 

Mortgage servicing rights may be purchased or may be recognized when mortgage loans are originated and sold with servicing rights retained. All mortgage servicing rights are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur. 

Mortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets. A cash flow model is used to determine fair value. Key assumptions and estimates, including projected prepayment speeds and assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates, used by this model are based on current market sources. Assumptions used to value mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs. A separate third-party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated daily for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of BOK Financial's servicing portfolio. Fair value estimates from outside sources are received at least annually to corroborate the results of the valuation model. 

Premises and Equipment 

&#160; 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, including capitalized interest when appropriate, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. Useful lives range from 5 years to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 years to 10 years for software and related implementation costs, and 3 years to 10 years for furniture and equipment. Construction in progress represents facilities construction and data processing systems projects underway that have not yet been placed into service. Depreciation and amortization begin once the assets are placed into service. 

Repair and maintenance costs, including software maintenance and enhancement costs, are charged to expense as incurred. Software licensing costs are generally charged to expense as incurred. Software licensing costs are capitalized if the contractual right to take possession of the software exists and it is feasible to take possession without significant penalty. Capitalized costs are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the software or remaining contractual life of the license. 

Premises no longer used by the Company are transferred to real estate and other repossessed assets. The transferred amount is the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value less estimated disposal costs as of the transfer date. 

Premises and equipment includes rights to use leased facilities and equipment. Right of use assets are initially measured by the present value of future rent payments over lease terms, adjusted for rent concessions. Rent payments exclude both payments made for non-lease components such as services and variable lease payments other than payments dependent on an index at lease commencement. Lease term includes options reasonably certain to be exercised. The right of use assets and lease liabilities are amortized to achieve straight-line expense over the lease term. Upon lease modification, the right of use asset and liability are reassessed and remeasured. Right of use assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances change that indicate an impairment may be necessary. Leases less than twelve months are excluded from capitalization. 

Ongoing technology projects of significant size or length are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Accumulated costs are reviewed for projects or components of projects that do not support the value of the asset being developed. Findings of obsolescence, duplicate effort or other conditions that do not support the recorded value are impaired, with the cost of the impaired components being charged to current-year earnings. 

Federal and State Income Taxes 

&#160; 

Determination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations. It also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events. Accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates, interpretations and judgments. 

BOK Financial and its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns. The subsidiaries provide for income taxes on a separate return basis and remit to BOK Financial amounts determined to be currently payable. BOK Financial is an agent for its subsidiaries under the Company's tax sharing agreements and has no ownership rights to any refunds received for the benefit of its subsidiaries. 

Management evaluates the Company's current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income, tax credits and statutory federal and state income tax rates. The amount of current income tax expense or benefit recognized in any period may differ from amounts reported to taxing authorities. Annually, we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns. 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in statutory tax rates on the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized through income tax expense in the period the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized. 

We also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that our position would prevail upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, based upon the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, are assessed quarterly and are part of our current accrued income tax liability. These may be adjusted through current income tax expense in future periods based on changing facts and circumstances, completion of examinations by taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations. 

Estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense. Income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved, generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities, expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in facts and circumstances. 

Employee Benefit Plans 

&#160; 

BOK Financial sponsors a defined contribution plan (&#8220;Thrift Plan&#8221;) and a defined benefit cash balance pension plan (&#8220;Pension Plan&#8221;). Employer contributions to the Thrift Plan, which matches employee contributions subject to percentage and years of service limits, are expensed when incurred. Pension Plan costs, which are based upon actuarial computations of current costs, are expensed annually. Pension Plan benefits were curtailed as of April 1, 2006. No participants may be added to the Pension Plan and no additional service benefits will be accrued. BOK Financial recognizes the funded status of its employee benefit plans. Adjustments required to recognize the Pension Plan's net funded status are made through accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. 

Share-Based Compensation Plans 

&#160; 

BOK Financial awards non-vested common shares and stock options as compensation to certain officers. The grant date fair value of non-vested shares is based on the then-current market value of BOK Financial common stock. Non-vested shares generally cliff vest in 3 years and are subject to a holding period after vesting of 2 years. The grant date fair value of stock options is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options generally have graded vesting over 7 years. Each tranche is considered a separate award for valuation and compensation cost recognition. 

Compensation cost is initially based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. Expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures over the vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur. Share-based compensation awarded to certain officers has performance conditions that affect the number of awards granted. Compensation cost is adjusted based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. 

Restricted stock units ("RSUs") may also be awarded for certain executives who have elected to defer income recognition upon vesting of their awards. RSUs are subject to the same vesting criteria as non-vested shares. Upon vesting and meeting other relevant conditions, RSUs are settled through cash distributions. The value of the awards will vary in amounts equal to changes in the fair value of an equal number of BOK Financial common shares. 

Tax effects of share-based payments are recognized through tax expense. Dividends on non-vested shares are charged to retained earnings. Dividend equivalents on RSUs are charged to expense. 

Other Operating Revenue 

&#160; 

Fees and commissions revenue is generated through the sales of products, consisting primarily of financial instruments, and the performance of services for customers under contractual obligations. Revenue from providing services for customers is recognized at the time services are provided in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those services. Revenue is recognized based on the application of five steps: 

&#8226; Identify the contract with a customer 

&#8226; Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

&#8226; Determine the transaction price 

&#8226; Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

&#8226; Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

For contracts with multiple performance obligations, individual performance obligations are accounted for separately if the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources readily available to the customer and the promise to transfer goods and services to the customer is separately identifiable in the contract. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. 

Revenue is recognized on a gross basis whenever we have primary responsibility and risk in providing the services or products to our customers and have discretion in establishing the price for the services or products. Revenue is recognized on a net basis whenever we act as an agent for products or services of others. 

Brokerage and trading revenue includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage, investment banking and insurance brokerage. Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains primarily related to sales of securities to institutional customers and related derivative contracts. Customer hedging revenue includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs including credit valuation adjustments, as necessary. We offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. These customer contracts are offset with contracts with selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize changes in market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Retail brokerage revenue represents fees and commissions earned on sales of fixed income securities, annuities, mutual funds and other financial instruments to retail customers. Investment banking revenue includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting and financial advisory services. Investment banking revenue also includes fees earned in conjunction with loan syndications. Insurance brokerage revenues represent fees and commissions earned on placement of insurance products with carriers for property and casualty and health coverage 

Transaction card revenue includes merchant discount fees and electronic funds transfer network fees, net of interchange fees paid to card issuers and assessments paid to card networks. Merchant discount fees represent fees paid by customers for account management and electronic processing of card transactions. Merchant discount fees are recognized at the time the customer&#8217;s transactions are processed or other services are performed. The Company also maintains the TransFund electronic funds transfer network for the benefit of its members, which includes BOKF, NA. Electronic funds transfer fees are recognized as electronic transactions are processed on behalf of its members. 

&#160; 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue includes fees from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and administration services. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis at the time the services are performed and may be based on either the fair value of the account or the service provided. 

&#160; 

Deposit service charges and fees include commercial account service charges, overdraft fees, check card fee revenue and automated service charges and other deposit service fees. Fees are recognized at least quarterly in accordance with published deposit account agreements and disclosure statements for retail accounts or contractual agreements for commercial accounts. Item charges for overdraft or non-sufficient funds items are recognized as items are presented for payment. Account balance charges and activity fees are accrued monthly and collected in arrears. Commercial account activity fees may be offset by an earnings credit based on account balances.

Mortgage servicing revenue includes servicing fee income and late charges on loans serviced for others. 

Newly Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements 

The following is a summary of newly adopted and pending accounting pronouncements that may have a more than insignificant effect on the Company's financial statements. 

Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost ("ASU 2016-13") 

On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 to provide more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. The Company adopted the new standard January 1, 2020, through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods were not restated. 

Under ASU 2016-13, acquired loans must be reserved in a manner consistent with originated loans while the incurred loss model excluded purchased loans because the loans had been marked to fair value at acquisition. Under ASU 2016-13, the fair value discount will remain in place and be accreted into interest income over the life of any acquired loans in the portfolio. 

Another transition adjustment component is related to expected credit losses for residential mortgage loans sold that exceed amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as we retain the credit risk for any amounts exceeding the guarantee as well as for recourse loans. 

Prior to ASU 2016-13, held-to-maturity non-agency securities carried no reserve for credit losses. 

Note 4 disaggregates the transition adjustment for loans and unfunded loan commitments among portfolio segments as well as on-and off-balance sheet reserves. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ("ASU 2020-04") 

On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. Under the new guidance, an entity can elect by accounting topic or industry subtopic to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract, if certain conditions are met. In addition, the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedge-by-hedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform, if certain conditions are met. A one-time election to sell and/or transfer held-to-maturity debt securities that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform is also allowed. ASU 2020-04 became effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 and will apply to all LIBOR reference rate modifications through December 31, 2022. Adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope ("ASU 2021-01") 

On January 7, 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in this update are elective and apply to all entities that have derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. The amendments also optionally apply to all entities that designate receive-variable-rate, pay-variable-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in net investment hedges that are modified as a result of reference rate reform. ASU 2021-01 is effective immediately for all entities and amendments may be applied on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. Adoption of ASU 2021-01 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements .

No credit impairment of available for sale securities was identified in 2021. Unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates subsequent to purchase and are not attributable to credit. Based on evaluations of impaired securities as of December 31, 2021, the Company does not intend to sell any impaired available for sale securities before fair value recovers to the current amortized cost and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell impaired securities before fair value recovers, which may be maturity.

At December 31, 2021, loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 6.8 billion or 34 % of the total loan portfolio. Loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 3.2 billion or 16 % of our total loan portfolio. Loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Colorado totaled $ 2.5 billion or 12 % of our total loan portfolio. Loans for which the collateral location is not relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans, are distributed by the borrower&#8217;s primary operating location. These geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas. 

At December 31, 2020, loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 7.2 billion or 31 % of the loan portfolio, loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 3.8 billion or 17 % of the loan portfolio and loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Colorado totaled $ 2.8 billion or 12 % of the loan portfolio. 

Commercial 

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent on-going relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer&#8217;s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer&#8217;s assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interest in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the on-going cash flow from operations of the customer&#8217;s business. Inherent lending risk is centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies. 

At December 31, 2021, commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 4.4 billion or 35 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. Commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 1.7 billion or 13 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. Commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Colorado totaled $ 1.6 billion or 13 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. The commercial loan portfolio segment is further divided into loan classes. The services loan class totaled $ 3.4 billion or 17 % of total loans. Approximately $ 1.7 billion of loans in the services class consisted of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Businesses included in the services class include Native American tribal and state and local municipal government entities, Native American tribal casino operations, educational services, foundations and not-for-profit organizations and specialty trade contractors. The energy loan class totaled $ 3.0 billion or 15 % of total loans, including $ 2.2 billion of outstanding loans to energy producers. Approximately 67 % of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 33 % of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas. The healthcare loan class totaled $ 3.4 billion or 17 % of total loans. The healthcare loan class consists primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers. 

At December 31, 2020, commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 4.3 billion or 33 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment, commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 1.8 billion or 14 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment and commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Colorado totaled $ 1.7 billion or 13 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. The energy loan class totaled $ 3.5 billion or 15 % of total loans, including $ 2.6 billion of outstanding loans to energy producers. At December 31, 2020, approximately 58 % of committed production loans were secured by properties primarily producing oil and 42 % were secured by properties producing natural gas. The services loan class totaled $ 3.5 billion or 15 % of total loans. Approximately $ 1.5 billion of loans in the services category consisted of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. The healthcare loan class totaled $ 3.3 billion or 14 % of total loans. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate loans are for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes primarily within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies. 

At December 31, 2021, 30 % of commercial real estate loans were secured by properties primarily located in the Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas of Texas and 12 % of commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located primarily in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metropolitan areas of Oklahoma. At December 31, 2020, 27 % of commercial real estate loans are secured by properties primarily located in the Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas of Texas and 10 % of commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located primarily in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metropolitan areas of Oklahoma. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

BOK Financial is actively participating in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provided fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified expenditures, including to help small business maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans generally have a contractual term of two years, though most are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the Company by the SBA. The loans carry a rate of 1%. Interest plus loan fees, which vary depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual life of the loan. Any unaccreted origination fees will be recognized when the loan is paid. 

Loans to Individuals 

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. These loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. 

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing. 

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. 

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans. 

Approximately 91 % of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower&#8217;s primary operating location. 

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Credit Commitments 

&#160; 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. At December 31, 2021, outstanding commitments totaled $ 12.5 billion. Because some commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. BOK Financial uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does loans. 

The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based upon management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the borrower. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Because the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments, BOK Financial uses the same credit policies in evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer. Additionally, BOK Financial uses the same evaluation process in obtaining collateral on standby letters of credit as it does for loan commitments. The term of these standby letters of credit is defined in each commitment and typically corresponds with the underlying loan commitment. At December 31, 2021, outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $ 700 million. 

Allowances for Credit Losses and Accrual for Off-balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loans Commitments 

BOK Financial maintains an allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded commitments. The allowance consists of specific allowances attributed to certain individual loans, generally nonaccruing loans, with dissimilar risk characteristics that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover and general allowances for estimated credit losses on pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics based on probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default for each loan class developed based on current and forecasted relevant economic loss drivers. 

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk is maintained at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated losses associated with credit instruments that are not currently recognized as assets such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit or guarantees that are not unconditionally cancellable by the bank. 

The activity in the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses related to loan commitments and standby letters of credit for the year ended December 31, 2021 is summarized as follows (in thousands):

Changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables, primarily due to the anticipated impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, and other assumptions, resulted in a $ 90.1 million decrease in the allowance for lending activities during the year ended December 31, 2021. Changes in the loan portfolio characteristics, including specific impairment and losses, loan balances and risk grading resulted in a $ 9.0 million decrease in the allowance for lending activities.

Credit Quality Indicators 

The Company utilizes risk grading as primary credit quality indicators as it influences the probability of default which is a key attribute in the expected credit losses calculation. Substantially all commercial as well as commercial real estate loans and certain loans to individuals are risk graded based on a quarterly evaluation of the borrowers&#8217; ability to repay the loans. Certain commercial loans and most loans to individuals are small, homogeneous pools that are not risk-graded. The credit quality of these loans is based on past due days in accordance with regulatory guidelines. 

We have included in the credit quality indicator &#8220;pass&#8221; loans that are in compliance with the original terms of the agreement and currently exhibit no factors that cause management to have doubts about the borrowers&#8217; ability to remain in compliance with the original terms of the agreement, which is consistent with the regulatory guideline of &#8220;pass.&#8221; This also includes past due residential mortgages that are guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government that continue to accrue interest based on criteria of the guarantors&#8217; programs. 

Other loans especially mentioned ("Special Mention") are currently performing in compliance with the original terms of the agreement but may have a potential weakness that deserves management&#8217;s close attention, consistent with regulatory guidelines. Non-graded loans 30 to 59 days past due are categorized as Special Mention. 

The risk grading process identified certain loans that have a well-defined weakness (for example, inadequate debt service coverage or liquidity or marginal capitalization; repayment may depend on collateral or other risk mitigation) that may jeopardize liquidation of the debt and represent a greater risk due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. This is consistent with the regulatory guideline for &#8220;substandard.&#8221; Because the borrowers are still performing in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements, these loans remain on accruing status. Non-graded loans 60 to 89 days past due are categorized as Accruing Substandard. 

Nonaccruing loans represent loans for which full collection of principal and interest is uncertain. This includes certain loans considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; and all loans considered &#8220;doubtful&#8221; by regulatory guidelines. Non-graded loans 90 or more days past due are categorized as Nonaccrual. 

Probability of default is lowest for pass graded loans and increases for each credit quality indicator, Special Mention, and Accruing Substandard. 

Vintage represents the year of origination, except for revolving loans which are considered in aggregate. Loans that were once revolving but have converted to term loans without additional underwriting appear in a separate vintage column.

(7) Mortgage Banking Activities 

Residential Mortgage Loan Production 

The Company originates, markets and services conventional and government-sponsored residential mortgage loans. Generally, conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans are held for sale in the secondary market and non-conforming and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are held for investment. The volume of mortgage loans originated for sale and secondary market prices are the primary drivers of originating and marketing revenue. 

Residential mortgage loan commitments are generally outstanding for 60 to 90 days, which represents the typical period from commitment to originate a residential mortgage loan to when the closed loan is sold to an investor. Residential mortgage loan commitments are subject to both credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed through underwriting policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, which are generally accepted by the secondary loan markets. Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is partially managed through forward sales of residential mortgage-backed securities and forward sales contracts. These latter contracts set the price for loans that will be delivered in the next 60 to 90 days. 

The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans held for sale, notional amounts of derivative contracts related to residential mortgage loan commitments and forward contract sales and their related fair values included in Mortgage loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were (in thousands):

Changes in primary residential mortgage interest rates directly affect the prepayment speeds used in valuing our mortgage servicing rights. A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of BOK Financial&#8217;s servicing portfolio.

The Federal Home Loan Banks have issued letters of credit totaling $ 500 million to secure BOK Financial&#8217;s obligations to depositors of public funds. The unused credit available to BOK Financial at December 31, 2021 pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank&#8217;s collateral policies is $ 5.9 billion. 

In 2016, BOK Financial issued $ 150 million of subordinated debt set to mature on June 30, 2056 . This debt bore an interest rate of 5.375 %, payable quarterly. On August 23, 2021, BOK Financial exercised its option to redeem the debt at the principal amount plus accrued interest and realized a $ 5.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 

As a result of the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, we obtained $ 60 million of subordinated debt issued in June 2015 that will mature on June 25, 2030 . This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.625 % through June 2025 and thereafter, the notes will bear interest at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 3.17% . The debt contains a call option that allows for repayment prior to contractual maturity. The call option is available on June 25, 2025 and quarterly thereafter at 100% of the principal amount. 

Also through CoBiz Financial, we acquired junior subordinated debentures split across three issuance tranches. Junior subordinated debentures of $ 21 million will mature September 17, 2033 and bear an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.95% that resets quarterly. Junior subordinated debentures of $ 31 million will mature on July 23, 2034 and bear an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.60% that resets quarterly. Junior subordinated debentures of $ 20 million will mature on September 30, 2035 and bear an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.45% that resets quarterly. The junior subordinated debentures are subject to early redemption prior to maturity.

Of the above unrecognized tax benefits, $ 16.4 million, if recognized, would have affected the effective tax rate. 

BOK Financial recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company recognized $ 2.3 million for 2021, $ 2.4 million for 2020 and $ 2.2 million for 2019 in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $ 6.4 million and $ 5.9 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Federal statutes remain open for federal tax returns filed in the previous three reporting periods. Various state income tax statutes remain open for the previous three to six reporting periods. 

(11) Employee Benefits 

BOK Financial sponsors a defined benefit cash balance Pension Plan for all employees who satisfy certain age and service requirements. Pension Plan benefits were curtailed as of April 1, 2006. No participants may be added to the plan and no additional service benefits will be accrued. Interest continues to accrue on employees' account balances at a variable rate tied to the five-year trailing average of five-year U.S. Treasury securities plus 1.5 %. The rate has a floor of 3.0 % and a ceiling of 5.0 %. The 2021 quarterly variable rates ranged from 3.13 % to 3.22 %. 

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, respectively, were $ 20 million and $ 39 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 24 million and $ 38 million at December 31, 2020. The net periodic benefit credit was $ 2.2 million for December 31, 2021, $ 1.3 million for December 31, 2020 and $ 815 thousand for December 31, 2019, and is included in Personnel expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Total expected future benefit payments related to the Pension Plan were $ 22.4 million at December 31, 2021. 

The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the Company's net periodic benefit cost as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 Discount rate 1.73 &#160; % 2.69 &#160; % Expected return on plan assets 5.50 &#160; % 5.50 &#160; % ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

Assets of the Pension Plan consist primarily of shares in the Cavanal Hill Active Core Fund. The stated objective of this fund is to provide an attractive total return with a well-balanced mix of equities and bonds. The typical portfolio mix is approximately 60 % equities and 40 % bonds. The net asset value of shares in the Cavanal Hill Funds is reported daily based on market quotations for the Fund&#8217;s securities. Management considers the Fund's recent and long-term performance as indicators when setting the expected return on plan assets. No minimum contribution was required for 2021, 2020 or 2019. On November 2, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a plan to terminate the Pension Plan and management is currently in the process of executing the termination strategy. 

Employee contributions to the Thrift Plan are eligible for Company matching equal to 6 % of base compensation, as defined in the plan. The Company-provided matching contribution rates range from 50 % for employees with less than 4 years of service to 200 % for employees with 15 or more years of service. Additionally, a maximum Company-provided, non-elective annual contribution of up to $ 750 per participant is provided for employees whose annual base compensation is less than $ 40,000 . Participants may direct investments in their accounts to a variety of options, including a BOK Financial common stock fund and Cavanal Hill funds. Employer contributions, which are invested in accordance with the participant&#8217;s investment options, vest over five years . Thrift Plan expenses were $ 30.5 million for 2021, $ 29.9 million for 2020 and $ 27.6 million for 2019. 

(12) Share-Based Compensation Plans 

The shareholders and Board of Directors of BOK Financial have approved various share-based compensation plans. An independent compensation committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of awards granted to the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. Share-based compensation is granted to other officers and employees as determined by the Chief Executive Officer. 

No options have been awarded since 2013. At December 31, 2021, the number of options outstanding and the weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding was not significant. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 496 thousand for 2021, $ 318 thousand for 2020 and $ 761 thousand for 2019. 

The Company also awards restricted stock to certain officers and employees and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain executives, (collectively "non-vested shares"). Vesting of all non-vested shares is subject to service requirements. Additionally, vesting of certain non-vested shares is subject to performance criteria based on changes in the Company's earnings per share relative to defined peers. The following represents a summary of the non-vested shares for the three years ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands): 

##TABLE_START Restricted Stock Restricted Stock Units &#160; Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Non-vested at January 1, 2019 527,607 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Granted 145,724 &#160; $ 76.74 &#160; 46,689 &#160; $ 87.40 &#160; Vested ( 114,201 ) 61.28 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Forfeited ( 131,952 ) 83.69 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-vested at December 31, 2019 427,178 &#160; 46,689 &#160; Granted 236,750 &#160; $ 83.49 &#160; 22,980 &#160; $ 77.36 &#160; Vested ( 225,527 ) 83.50 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Forfeited ( 18,167 ) 83.10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-vested at December 31, 2020 420,234 &#160; 69,669 &#160; Granted 247,917 &#160; $ 73.01 &#160; 17,570 &#160; $ 88.25 &#160; Vested ( 166,965 ) 94.96 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Forfeited ( 11,632 ) 75.83 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-vested at December 31, 2021 489,554 &#160; 87,239 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

Compensation expense recognized on non-vested shares totaled $ 9.3 million for 2021, $ 16.0 million for 2020 and $ 15.1 million for 2019. Unrecognized compensation cost of non-vested shares totaled $ 12.6 million at December 31, 2021. We expect to recognize compensation expense of $ 8.3 million in 2022, $ 4.1 million in 2023, and $ 224 thousand in 2024. 

Compensation cost for restricted stock units is variable based on the current fair value of BOK Financial common shares. Vesting of 101,495 non-vested shares may be increased or decreased based on performance criteria defined in the plan documents. 

(13) Related Parties

(14) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 

Litigation Contingencies 

As a member of Visa, BOK Financial is obligated for a proportionate share of certain covered litigation losses incurred by Visa under a retrospective responsibility plan. A contingent liability was recognized for the Company&#8217;s share of Visa&#8217;s covered litigation liabilities. Visa funded an escrow account to cover litigation claims, including covered litigation losses under the retrospective responsibility plan, with proceeds from its initial public offering in 2008 and from available cash. 

BOK Financial currently owns 252,533 Visa Class B shares which are convertible into 408,624 shares of Visa Class A shares after the final settlement of all covered litigation. Class B shares may be diluted in the future if the escrow fund is not adequate to cover future covered litigation costs. No value has been currently assigned to the Class B shares. 

On June 24, 2015, BOKF, NA received a complaint that an employee had colluded with a bond issuer and an individual in misusing revenues pledged to municipal bonds for which BOKF, NA served as trustee under the bond indenture. The Company conducted an investigation and concluded that employees in one of its Corporate Trust offices had, with respect to a single group of affiliated bond issuances, violated Company policies and procedures. The relationship manager was terminated. The Company reported the circumstances to, and cooperated with an investigation by, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). On September 7, 2016, BOKF, NA agreed, and the SEC entered, a consent order finding that BOKF, NA had violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and requiring BOKF, NA to disgorge $ 1,067,721 of fees and pay a civil penalty of $ 600,000 . BOKF, NA disgorged the fees and paid the penalty. On August 26, 2016, BOKF, NA was sued in the United States District Court for New Jersey by two bondholders in a putative class action alleging BOKF, NA participated in the fraudulent sale of securities by the principals. The action remains stayed with no current deadlines pending. On September 14, 2016, BOKF, NA was sued in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma by 19 bondholders also alleging BOKF, NA participated in the fraudulent sale of securities by the principals. The Tulsa County District Court action is pending on BOKF, NA&#8217;s motion to dismiss the plaintiff's Third Amended Petition. 

On December 28, 2015, in an action brought by the SEC, the New Jersey District Court entered a judgment against the principals involved in issuing the bonds. On January 8, 2020, the Court entered judgment against the principal individual and his wife for $ 36,805,051 in principal amount and $ 10,937,831 in pre-judgment interest. The SEC continues to aggressively pursue collection of the judgment. If the individual principal and his wife cannot pay the bonds, a bondholder loss could become probable. Management has been advised by counsel that BOKF, NA has valid defenses to claims of bondholders and that no loss to the Company is probable. No provision for losses has been made at this time. BOKF, NA estimates that, upon sale of all remaining collateral securing payment of the bonds, approximately $ 20 million will remain outstanding. A reasonable estimate cannot be made of the amount of any bondholder loss, though the amount of bondholder loss could be material to the Company in the event a loss to the Company becomes probable. 

On September 29, 2021, The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the previously reported putative class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging an extended overdraft fee charged by BOKF, NA was interest. The dismissal by the United States District Court for New Mexico of a second putative class action in which the plaintiff made the same allegations as were made in the Texas action remains on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Management is advised by counsel that a loss is not probable and that the loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 

On March 7, 2020, three former employees sued BOKF, NA, the Plan Committee of the BOKF, NA 401k Plan, and Cavanal Hill Investment Management, Inc., a subsidiary of BOKF, NA, alleging that the defendants included proprietary investment products as investment options in the BOKF, NA 401k Plan, whose fees were too high and performance too low, for the purpose of earning fees. The action is brought as a putative class action on behalf of all Plan Participants. The action is pending on the defendants' motion to dismiss. Management is advised by counsel that a loss is not probable and that the loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 

In 2019, a limited liability partnership sued BOKF, NA in Colorado District Court alleging that the Bank breached various fiduciary duties as trustee of a trust that was a co-general partner of the partnership and claiming in excess of $ 60 million in damages. From 2000 to 2009, BOKF was serving as personal representative of the estate of the creator of the trust. In 2009, BOKF moved to close the probate of the estate in the Colorado Probate Court. The members of the partnership who now sue BOKF objected to the closing of the estate and made the same allegations in the 2009 probate hearing as they now make in the 2019 Colorado District Court action. In 2009, the Colorado Probate Court entered summary judgment against the beneficiaries and the estate was closed. In the 2019 action, the Colorado District Court denied BOKF&#8217;s motions for summary judgment and the matter is proceeding to trial. Management is advised by counsel that a loss is not probable and that the loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 

In the ordinary course of business, BOK Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes, based upon the opinion of counsel, that the actions and liability or loss, if any, resulting from the final outcomes of the proceedings, will not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Alternative Investment Commitments 

The Company sponsors a private equity fund and invests in several tax credit entities and other funds as permitted by banking regulations. Consolidation of these investments is based on the variable interest model. 

At December 31, 2021, the Company has $ 352 million in interests in various alternative investments generally consisting of unconsolidated limited partnership interests in entities for which investment return is in the form of low income housing tax credits or other investments in merchant banking activities.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had $ 290 million in interests in various alternative investments and included $ 94 million in unfunded commitments in Other liabilities. 

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

Cavanal Hill Funds&#8217; assets include U.S. Treasury and government securities money market funds. Assets of these funds consist of highly-rated, short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury and Agencies. The net asset value of units in these funds was $ 1.00 at December 31, 2021. An investment in these funds is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or guaranteed by BOK Financial or any of its subsidiaries. BOK Financial may, but is not obligated to purchase assets from these funds to maintain the net asset value at $ 1.00 . No assets were purchased from the funds in 2021 or 2020. 

The Federal Reserve Bank requires member banks to maintain certain minimum average cash balances. Member banks may satisfy reserve balance requirements through holdings of vault cash and balances maintained directly with a Federal Reserve Bank. The combined average balance of vault cash and balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank was $ 905 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 727 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

(15) Shareholders Equity 

Preferred Stock 

&#160; 

One billion shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.00005 per share are authorized. The Series A Preferred Stock has no voting rights except as otherwise provided by Oklahoma corporate law and may be converted into one share of Common Stock for each 36 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the option of the holder . Dividends are cumulative at an annual rate of ten percent of the $ 0.06 per share liquidation preference value when declared and are payable in cash. Aggregate liquidation preference is $ 15 million. No Series A Preferred Stock was outstanding in 2021, 2020 or 2019. 

&#160; 

Common Stock 

&#160; 

Common stock consists of 2.5 billion authorized shares with a $ 0.00006 par value. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share at the election of the Board of Directors and on any question arising at any shareholders&#8217; meeting and to receive dividends when and as declared. Additionally, regulations restrict the ability of national &#160; banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends. 

&#160; 

Subsidiary Bank 

&#160; 

The amounts of dividends that BOK Financial&#8217;s subsidiary bank can declare and the amounts of loans the subsidiary bank can extend to affiliates are limited by various federal banking regulations and state corporate law. Generally, dividends declared during a calendar year are limited to net profits, as defined, for the year plus retained profits for the preceding two years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. 

Regulatory Capital 

BOK Financial and the subsidiary bank is subject to various capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material effect on BOK Financial's operations. These capital requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 

A bank falling below the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and executive bonus payments. For a banking institution to qualify as well capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier I, Total and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.5 %, 8 %, 10 % and 5 %, respectively. Tier I capital consists primarily of common stockholders' equity, excluding unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities, less goodwill, core deposit premiums and certain other intangible assets. Total capital consists primarily of Tier I capital plus preferred stock, subordinated debt and allowances for credit losses, subject to certain limitations. The subsidiary bank exceeded the regulatory definition of well capitalized as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

AOCI includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale ("AFS") securities and non-credit related unrealized losses on AFS securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recorded in earnings. Unrealized losses on employee benefit plans will be reclassified into income as pension plan costs are recognized over the remaining service period of plan participants. Gains and losses in AOCI are net of deferred income taxes.

(17) Reportable Segments 

BOK Financial operates three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products to small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business customers served through the consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private bank services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities. 

In addition to its lines of business, BOK Financial has a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds Management and Other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business. 

BOK Financial allocates resources and evaluates performance of its lines of business after allocation of funds and capital costs. Credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes on statutory rates. The allocation for the prior comparable periods have been revised on a comparable basis. 

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar duration. Market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk. 

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is based on rates which approximate the wholesale market rates for funds with similar duration and re-pricing characteristics. Market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their re-pricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the short-term wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short-term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years. 

Substantially all revenue is from domestic customers. No single external customer accounts for more than 10% of total revenue. 

Net loans charged off and provision for credit losses represents net loans charged off or recovered as attributed to the lines of business. The provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs or recoveries is attributed to Funds Management and Other. 

The operations of CoBiz, acquired on October 1, 2018 were allocated to the operating segments in the second quarter of 2019. Prior to April 1, 2019, CoBiz operations were included in Funds Management and other.

(19) Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. Certain assets and liabilities are recorded in the Company&#8217;s financial statements at fair value. Some are recorded on a recurring basis and some on a non-recurring basis. 

For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. A hierarchy for fair value has been established which categorizes into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels are as follows: 

Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets or Liabilities (Level 1) - fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) - fair value is based on significant other observable inputs which are generally determined based on a single price for each financial instrument provided to us by an applicable third-party pricing service and is based on one or more of the following: 

&#8226; Quoted prices for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities in active markets; 

&#8226; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 

&#8226; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; 

&#8226; Other inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs. 

Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) - fair value is based upon model-based valuation techniques for which at least one significant assumption is not observable in the market. 

Transfers between levels are recognized as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers in or out of quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to significant other observable inputs or significant unobservable inputs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Transfers between significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included in the summary of changes in recurring fair values measured using unobservable inputs. 

The underlying methods used by the third-party pricing services are considered in determining the primary inputs used to determine fair values. Management has evaluated the methodologies employed by the third-party pricing services by comparing the price provided by the pricing service with other sources, including brokers' quotes, sales or purchases of similar instruments and discounted cash flows to establish a basis for reliance on the pricing service values. Significant differences between the pricing service provided value and other sources are discussed with the pricing service to understand the basis for their values. Based on all observable inputs, management may adjust prices obtained from third-party pricing services to more appropriately reflect the prices that would be received to sell assets or paid to transfer liabilities in orderly transactions in the current market. No significant adjustments were made to prices provided by third-party pricing services at December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis is as follows as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

Following is a description of the Company's valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis: 

Securities 

The fair values of trading, available for sale and fair value option securities are based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, when available. If quoted prices for identical instruments are not available, fair values are based on significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices of comparable instruments or interest rates and credit spreads, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds and loss severities. 

The fair value of certain available for sale and held-to-maturity municipal and other debt securities may be based on significant unobservable inputs. These significant unobservable inputs include limited observed trades, projected cash flows, current credit rating of the issuers and, when applicable, the insurers of the debt and observed trades of similar debt. Discount rates are primarily based on reference to interest rate spreads on comparable securities of similar duration and credit rating as determined by the nationally-recognized rating agencies adjusted for a lack of trading volume. Significant unobservable inputs are developed by investment securities professionals involved in the active trading of similar securities. A summary of significant inputs used to value these securities follows. A management committee composed of senior members from the Company's Capital Markets, Risk Management and Finance departments assess the appropriateness of these inputs quarterly. 

Derivatives 

All derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for exchange-traded contracts are based on quoted prices. Fair values for over-the-counter interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange contracts are based on valuations provided either by third-party dealers in the contracts, quotes provided by independent pricing services, or a third-party provided pricing model that uses significant other observable market inputs. 

Credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of derivative instruments. Management determines fair value adjustments based on various risk factors including but not limited to counterparty credit rating or equivalent loan grading, derivative contract notional size, price volatility of the underlying commodity, duration of the derivative contracts and expected loss severity. Expected loss severity is based on historical losses for similarly risk graded commercial loan customers. Decreases in counterparty credit rating or grading and increases in price volatility and expected loss severity all tend to increase the credit quality adjustment which reduces the fair value of asset contracts. 

We also consider our own credit risk in determining the fair value of derivative contracts. Changes in our credit rating would affect the fair value of our derivative liabilities. In the event of a credit downgrade, the fair value of our derivative liabilities would increase. 

Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair values of conforming residential mortgage loans held for sale are based upon quoted market prices of such loans sold in securitization transactions, including related unfunded loan commitments. The fair value of mortgage loans that are unable to be sold to U.S. government agencies is determined using quoted prices of loans that are sold in securitization transactions with a liquidity discount applied. 

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include pension plan assets, which are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments, collateral for certain nonaccruing loans and real property and other assets acquired to satisfy loans, which are based primarily on comparisons to completed sales of similar assets. 

The following represents the carrying value of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and related losses recorded during the year. The carrying value represents only those assets with the balance sheet date for which the fair value was adjusted during the year:

The fair value of collateral-dependent nonaccruing loans and real estate and other repossessed assets and the related fair value adjustments are generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals. Our appraisal review policies require appraised values to be supported by observed inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on significant unobservable inputs. Non-recurring fair value measurements of collateral-dependent nonaccruing loans and real estate and other repossessed assets based on significant unobservable inputs are generally due to estimates of current fair values between appraisal dates. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry. Non-recurring fair value measurements of collateral dependent loans secured by mineral rights are generally determined by our internal staff of engineers on projected cash flows under current market conditions and are based on significant unobservable inputs. Projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Assets are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current prices with existing conventional equipment, operating methods and costs. Significant unobservable inputs are developed by asset management and workout professionals and approved by senior Credit Administration executives.
