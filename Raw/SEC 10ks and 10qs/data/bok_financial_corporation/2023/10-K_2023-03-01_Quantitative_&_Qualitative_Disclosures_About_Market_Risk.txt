 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market Risk 

Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading. Market risk excludes changes in fair value due to credit of the individual issuers of financial instruments. 

BOK Financial is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on both its assets held for purposes other than trading and trading assets. The effects of other changes such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to BOK Financial. BOK Financial has no material investments in assets that are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices. Energy and other commodity derivative contracts, which are affected by changes in commodity prices, are matched against offsetting contracts as previously discussed. 

The Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for managing market risk in accordance with policy limits established by the Board of Directors. The Committee monitors projected variation in net interest revenue, net income and economic value of equity due to specified changes in interest rates. These limits also set maximum levels for short-term borrowings, short-term assets, public funds and brokered deposits and establish minimum levels for un-pledged assets, among other things. Further, the Board approved market risk limits for fixed income trading, mortgage pipeline and mortgage servicing assets inclusive of economic hedge benefits. Exposure is measured daily and compliance is reviewed monthly. Deviations from the Board approved limits, which periodically occur throughout the reporting period, may require management to develop and execute plans to reduce exposure. These plans are subject to escalation to and approval by the Board. 

The simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effects of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics, future cash flows and customer behavior. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, models cannot precisely estimate or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. 

Interest Rate Risk &#8211; Other than Trading 

&#160; 

As previously noted in the Net Interest Revenue section of this report, management has implemented strategies to manage the Company&#8217;s balance sheet to have relatively limited exposure to changes in interest rates over a twelve-month period. The effectiveness of these strategies in managing the overall interest rate risk is evaluated through the use of an asset/liability model. BOK Financial performs a sensitivity analysis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures, including embedded option positions, on net interest revenue. A simulation model is used to estimate the effect of changes in interest rates on our performance across multiple interest rate scenarios. Our current internal policy limit for net interest revenue variation due to a 200 basis point parallel change in market interest rates over twelve months is a maximum decline of 5%. The results of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low deposit rate environment are not meaningful. Until such time as it becomes meaningful, we will instead report the effect of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates. Management also reviews alternative rate changes and time periods. 

On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of the U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") will cease immediately following a final publication on June 30, 2023. Further, U.S. regulators released a joint inter-agency statement about their expectations that banks cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. 

The Bank has ceased production of new LIBOR-based exposure as of December 31, 2021 and now offers floating rate products in various alternative reference rates with the majority of volume being observed thus far in simple or term rate versions of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). Key loan provisions have been modified so that new and renewed loans include LIBOR fallback language designed to ensure the smoothest possible transition from LIBOR to the new benchmark when such transition occurs. All existing financial contracts with direct exposure to LIBOR have been inventoried, and the Company has taken action to transition these exposures to an alternative reference rate in advance of the June 30, 2023 deadline. 

The Company&#8217;s primary interest rate exposures include the Federal Funds rate, which affects short-term borrowings, and the prime lending rate, LIBOR and SOFR, which are the basis for much of the variable rate loan pricing. Additionally, residential mortgage rates directly affect the prepayment speeds for residential mortgage-backed securities and mortgage servicing rights. Derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used for purposes other than trading are included in this simulation. In addition, the impact on the level and composition of demand deposit accounts and other core deposit balances resulting from a significant increase in short-term market interest rates and the overall interest rate environment is likely to be material. The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the effects of such changes based on a combination of historical analysis and expected behavior. The impact of planned growth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model. 

The interest rate sensitivity in Table 33 indicates management&#8217;s estimation of the impact of rate changes on net interest revenue. Should deposit costs be 10%more sensitive to changes in rates, the variation in net interest revenue over the next twelve months would be (1.75)%, or ($27.2 million) for the 200 basis point increase scenario. Alternatively, should deposit funding costs be 10% less sensitive to changes in rates, the variation in net interest revenue over the next twelve months would be an increase of 0.34%, or $5.2 million for the 200 basis point increase scenario. Additionally, in a flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates increase by 100 basis points and short-term rates increase by 200 basis points, net interest revenue would decrease approximately 2.52%, or $39.1 million.

BOK Financial is also subjected to market risk through changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are highly dependent on changes in primary mortgage rates offered to borrowers, intermediate-term interest rates that affect the value of custodial funds, and assumptions about servicing revenues, servicing costs and discount rates. As primary mortgage rates increase, prepayment speeds slow and the value of our mortgage servicing rights increases. As primary mortgage rates fall, prepayment speeds increase and the value of our mortgage servicing rights decreases. 

We maintain a portfolio of financial instruments which may include debt securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge of the changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights. Composition of this portfolio will change based on our assessment of market risk. Changes in the fair value of residential mortgage-backed securities are highly dependent on changes in secondary mortgage rates required by investors, and interest rate derivative contracts are highly dependent on changes in other market interest rates. While primary and secondary mortgage rates generally move in the same direction, the spread between them may widen and narrow due to market conditions and government intervention. Changes in the forward-looking spread between the primary and secondary rates can cause significant earnings volatility. 

Management performs a stress test to measure market risk due to changes in interest rates inherent in its MSR portfolio and hedges. The stress test shocks applicable interest rates up and down 50 basis points and calculates an estimated change in fair value, net of economic hedging activity, that may result. The Board has approved a $20 million market risk limit for mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges.

Trading Activities 

The Company bears market risk by originating residential mortgages held for sale ("RMHFS"). RMHFS are generally outstanding for 60 to 90 days, which represents the typical period from commitment to originate a loan to sale of the closed loan to an investor. Primary mortgage interest rate changes during this period affect the value of RMHFS commitments and loans. We use forward sale contracts to mitigate market risk on all closed mortgage loans held for sale and on an estimate of mortgage loan commitments that are expected to result in closed loans. 

A variety of methods are used to monitor market risk of mortgage origination activities. These methods include daily marking of all positions to market value, independent verification of inventory pricing, and revenue sensitivity limits. 

Management performs a stress test to measure market risk due to changes in interest rates inherent in the mortgage production pipeline. The stress test shocks applicable interest rates up and down 50 basis points and calculates an estimated change in fair value, net of economic hedging activity that may result. The Board has approved a $7 million market risk limit for the mortgage production pipeline, net of forward sale contracts.

BOK Financial enters into trading activities both as an intermediary for customers and for its own account. As an intermediary, we take positions in securities, generally residential mortgage-backed securities, government agency securities and municipal bonds. These securities are purchased for resale to customers, which include individuals, corporations, foundations and financial institutions. On a limited basis, we may also take trading positions in U.S. Treasury securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds to enhance returns on securities portfolios. Both of these activities involve interest rate risk, liquidity risk and price risk. BOK Financial has an insignificant exposure to foreign exchange risk and does not take positions in commodity derivatives. 

A variety of methods are used to monitor and manage the market risk of trading activities. These methods include daily marking of all positions to market value, independent verification of inventory pricing, and position limits for each trading activity. Risk management tools include Value at Risk ("VaR"), stress testing and sensitivity analysis. Economic hedges in either the futures or cash markets may be used to reduce the risk associated with some trading programs. Basis Risk can result when trading asset values and the instruments used to hedge them move at different rates. 

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. BOK Financial utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. 

Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, including its reliance on past market behavior which might not be indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing ("Stressed VaR"), and sensitivity analysis. 

Stressed VaR is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company&#8217;s trading portfolio. 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR and Stressed VaR profiles are influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. Table 36 below summarizes certain VaR and Stressed VaR based measures for the three months ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the period-end VaR and SVaR measures increased relative to the previous quarter mainly due to an increase in total trading assets. Both VaR and SVaR measures decreased relative to 2021 due to a decrease in basis risk between trading assets and their economic hedges.

The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance. The Company updates historical data used by the VaR model on a regular basis and model validators independent of business lines perform regular modeled validations to access model input, processing, and reporting components. These models are required to be independently validated and approved prior to implementation. 

Limit Structure 

Beyond VaR and SVaR described above, Management also performs a sensitivity analysis to measure market risk from changes in interest rates on its trading portfolio. Applicable interest rates are shocked up and down 50 basis points calculating an estimated change in fair value, net of economic hedging activity that may result. The Board has approved an $8 million market risk limit for the trading portfolio, net of economic hedges.

Model Risk Governance and Review 

BOK Financial has an internal but independent Model Risk Governance and Review ("MRGR") team that validates models to verify they are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, performing as expected and in line with their intended use. MRGR also enforces the Company&#8217;s model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to levy findings requiring remediation and to restrict model usage. 

Model Validation 

MRGR is independent of both the developers and users of the models. The team validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the data, theory, implementation, outcomes and governance of each scenario. MRGR assigns each model a model risk score, which determines the frequency and scope of each validation. Validations comprise an assessment of model performance as well as a model&#8217;s potential limitations given its particular assumptions or weaknesses. Based on the results of the review, the team determines the use case for the model. The ultimate validation results may require remediation actions from the business line. MRGR communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: "Approved for use," "Approved with findings," or "Unapproved."
