Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of BOK Financial Corporation 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited BOK Financial Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, BOK Financial Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of BOK Financial Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of BOK Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BOK Financial Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for loan losses 

Description of the Matter 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio totaled $21.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and the associated allowance for loan losses (ALL) was $211 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the ALL is established to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the portfolio. Management&#8217;s estimate for the inherent losses within the loan portfolio consists of specific allowances attributed to impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts expected to be recovered, general allowances, including inherent risks, for unimpaired loans based on estimated loss rates by loan class and nonspecific allowances. General allowances for unimpaired loans are based on an estimated loss rate by loan class not considering recoveries. General allowances for unimpaired loans also consider inherent risks identified for each loan class. Inherent risks consider loss rates that most appropriately represent the current credit cycle and other factors attributable to a specific loan class which have not yet been represented in the historical gross loss rates or risk grading. Nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class. These factors include trends in the economy in primary lending areas, concentration in large-balance loans and other relevant factors. 

Auditing management&#8217;s estimate of the ALL involves a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the determination of inherent risk adjustments to loss rates by loan class and the non-specific allowances. Management&#8217;s determination of the inherent risk adjustments and identification and measurement of the nonspecific allowances is highly judgmental and could have a significant effect on the ALL. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

&#160; 

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of related controls over the calculation and recording of the ALL. Specifically, we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls around inherent risk adjustments to loss rates by loan class identified by the Company, the identification of such inherent risk factors, the applicability of that risk factor to the Company&#8217;s portfolio, and the measurement of the impact of that risk factor. We tested controls over management&#8217;s process for identifying appropriate nonspecific allowances, the determination of whether any adjustment was warranted, and the measurement of the recorded adjustments. 

To test the inherent risk adjustments to loss rates by loan class and non-specific allowances, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodology used by the Company to estimate the ALL and the underlying data used by the Company in its calculation of the ALL. To evaluate inherent risk adjustments to loss rates by loan class identified by the Company, as well as any nonspecific allowance recorded, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to the Company&#8217;s historical loss data, industry data, or economic data and evaluated whether such data was indicative of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We tested inputs and assumptions used in the buildup of inherent risk adjustments to loss rates by loan class and the nonspecific allowance, and we evaluated the basis for adjustments considered, the basis for concluding an adjustment was warranted, which considered the assessment associated with whether the historical data adequately captured the risk in the current portfolio, and the completeness of the inputs used by management in determining such adjustments. 

We compared the overall ALL amount to those established by similar banking institutions as a consideration around potentially contradictory information. We also reviewed subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborate or contradict the Company&#8217;s conclusion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

( 1 ) Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

&#160; 

The Consolidated Financial Statements of BOK Financial Corporation (&#8220;BOK Financial&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), including interpretations of U.S. GAAP issued by federal banking regulators and general practices of the banking industry. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BOK Financial and its subsidiaries, principally BOKF, NA, BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Private Wealth, Inc., BOK Financial Insurance, Inc. and Cavanal Hill Distributors, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of operations of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) when BOK Financial is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Variable interest entities are generally defined as entities that either do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without support from other parties or whose equity investors lack a controlling financial interest. Determination that the Company is the primary beneficiary considers the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the variable interest or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest that could be significant to the variable interest. 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 

Nature of Operations 

BOK Financial, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide range of financial services to commercial and industrial customers, other financial institutions, municipalities, and consumers. These services include depository and cash management; lending and lease financing; mortgage banking; securities brokerage, trading and underwriting; and personal and corporate trust. 

BOKF, NA operates as Bank of Oklahoma primarily in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metropolitan areas of the state of Oklahoma and Bank of Texas primarily in the Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas of the state of Texas. In addition, BOKF, NA does business as BOK Financial in the metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Arizona; Northwest Arkansas; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Missouri/Kansas; and as Bank of Albuquerque in Albuquerque, New Mexico. BOKF, NA also operates the TransFund electronic funds network, Cavanal Hill Investment Management, and BOK Financial Asset Management, Inc. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of BOK Financial's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates of future economic activities, including loan collectability, loss contingencies, prepayments and cash flows from customer accounts. These estimates are based upon current conditions and information available to management. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. 

Acquisitions 

&#160; 

Assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The purchase price includes consideration paid at closing and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration that will be paid in the future, subject to achieving defined performance criteria. Premiums and discounts assigned to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are amortized over the lives of the acquired assets and liabilities on either an individual instrument or pool basis. Provision for credit losses is recognized for changes in credit quality after the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Consolidated Statements of Earnings include the results of operations from the acquisition date. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

&#160; 

Goodwill and intangible assets generally result from business combinations and are evaluated for each of BOK Financial's reporting units for impairment annually or more frequently if conditions indicate impairment. The evaluation of possible impairment of goodwill and intangible assets involves significant judgment based upon short-term and long-term projections of future performance. 

Reporting units are defined by the Company as significant lines of business within each operating segment. This definition is consistent with the manner in which the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the Company and makes decisions concerning the allocation of resources. The Company qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units are less than their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements. This assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, the financial and stock performance of the Company and other relevant factors. 

If the Company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired, a quantitative one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method. Goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. 

Intangible assets are generally composed of customer relationships, naming rights, non-compete agreements and core deposit premiums. They are amortized using accelerated or straight-line methods, as appropriate, over the estimated benefit periods. These periods range from 3 years to 20 years . The net book values of identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when economic conditions indicate impairment may exist. 

&#160; 

Cash Equivalents 

&#160; 

Due from banks, funds sold (generally federal funds sold for one day ), resell agreements (which generally mature within one day to 30 days ) and investments in money market funds are considered cash equivalents. 

Securities 

&#160; 

Securities are identified as trading, investment (held to maturity) or available for sale at the time of purchase based upon the intent of management, liquidity and capital requirements, regulatory limitations and other relevant factors. Trading securities, which are acquired for profit through resale, are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in current period earnings. Investment securities are carried at amortized cost. Amortization is computed by methods that approximate level yield and is adjusted for changes in prepayment estimates. Securities identified as available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of deferred income taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Available for sale securities are separately identified as pledged to creditors if the creditor has the right to sell or re-pledge the collateral. 

The purchase or sale of securities is recognized on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are based upon specific identification of the security sold. A receivable or payable is recognized for subsequent transaction settlement. 

&#160; 

On a quarterly basis, the Company performs separate evaluations of impaired debt investment and available for sale securities to determine if the decline in fair value below the amortized cost is other-than-temporary. 

Management determines whether it intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell impaired securities. This determination considers current and forecasted liquidity requirements and securities portfolio management. If the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the impaired debt security, a charge is recognized against earnings for the entire unrealized loss. For all impaired debt securities for which there is no intent or expected requirement to sell, the evaluation considers all available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that all amounts due would not be collected according to the security's contractual terms. Impairment of debt securities rated investment grade by nationally-recognized rating agencies is considered temporary unless specific contrary information is identified. Impairment of debt securities rated below investment grade by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies is evaluated based on projections of estimated cash flows. Any expected credit loss due to the inability to collect all amounts due according to the security's contractual terms is recognized as a charge against earnings. Any remaining unrealized loss related to other factors would be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes. 

BOK Financial may elect to carry certain securities that are not held for trading purposes at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. These securities are held with the intent that gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights or other financial instruments. 

Restricted equity securities represent equity interests the Company is required to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Restricted equity securities are carried at cost as these securities do not have a readily determined fair value because ownership of these shares is restricted and they lack a market. 

The fair value of our securities portfolio is generally based on a single price for each financial instrument provided to us by a third-party pricing service determined by one or more of the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Quoted prices for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities in active markets; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Other inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs. 

##TABLE_END 

The underlying methods used by the third-party pricing services are considered in determining the primary inputs used to determine fair values. We evaluate the methodologies employed by the third-party pricing services by comparing the price provided by the pricing service with other sources, including brokers' quotes, sales or purchases of similar instruments and discounted cash flows to establish a basis for reliance on the pricing service values. Significant differences between the pricing service provided value and other sources are discussed with the pricing service to understand the basis for their values. Based on all observable inputs, management may adjust prices obtained from third-party pricing services to more appropriately reflect the prices that would be received to sell assets or paid to transfer liabilities in orderly transactions in the current market. 

Derivative Instruments 

&#160; 

Derivative instruments may be used by the Company as part of its internal risk management programs or may be offered to customers. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are generally reported in income as they occur. The determination of fair value of derivative instruments considers changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Fair values for exchange-traded contracts are based on quoted prices in an active market for identical instruments. Fair values for over-the-counter contracts are generated internally using third-party valuation models. Inputs used in third-party valuation models to determine fair values are considered significant other observable inputs. Credit risk is also considered in determining fair value. Deterioration in the credit rating of customers or other counterparties reduces the fair value of asset contracts. Deterioration of our credit rating could decrease the fair value of our derivative liabilities. 

When bilateral netting agreements or similar agreements exist between the Company and its counterparties that create a single legal claim or obligation to pay or receive the net amount in settlement of the individual derivative contracts, the Company reports derivative assets and liabilities on a net by derivative contract by counterparty basis. 

Derivative contracts may also require the Company to provide or receive cash margin as collateral for derivative assets and liabilities. Derivative assets and liabilities are reported net of cash margin when certain conditions are met. In addition, derivative contracts executed with customers under Customer Risk Management Programs may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer. Access to collateral in the event of default is reasonably assured. 

BOK Financial may use derivative instruments in managing its interest rate sensitivity, as part of its economic hedge of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and to mitigate the market risk of holding trading securities. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in managing interest rate sensitivity and as part of its economic hedge of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are included in Other Operating Revenue - Gain (loss) on derivatives, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to mitigate the market risk of holding trading securities are included in Operating Revenue - Brokerage and trading revenue. 

BOK Financial also enters into mortgage loan commitments that are considered derivative contracts. Forward sales contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments are used to economically hedge these mortgage loan commitments as well as mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan commitments, forward sales contracts, and residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are reported in Other Operating Revenue - Mortgage banking revenue. 

BOK Financial offers programs that permit its customers to manage various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural products, interest rates and foreign exchange rates with derivative contracts. Customers may also manage interest rate risk through interest rate swaps used by the borrower to modify interest rate terms of their loans or to-be-announced securities used by our mortgage banking customers to hedge their loan production. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and BOK Financial. Offsetting contracts are executed between BOK Financial and other selected counterparties to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or fee paid to BOK Financial as profit and compensation for administrative costs and credit risk which is recognized over the life of the contracts and included in other Operating Revenue - Brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Loans 

&#160; 

Loans are either secured or unsecured based on the type of loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Repayment is generally expected from cash flow or proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrower. BOK Financial is exposed to risk of loss on loans due to the borrower's financial difficulties, which may arise from any number of factors, including problems within the respective industry or local economic conditions. Access to collateral, in the event of borrower default, is reasonably assured through adherence to applicable lending laws and through sound lending standards and credit review procedures. Accounting policies for all loans, excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, are as follows. 

Interest is accrued at the applicable interest rate on the outstanding principal amount. Loans are placed on nonaccruing status when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is uncertain. Internally risk graded loans are individually evaluated for nonaccruing status quarterly. Non-risk graded loans are generally placed on nonaccruing status when 90 days or more past due or within 60 days of being notified of the borrower's bankruptcy filing. Interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against interest income when the loan is placed on nonaccruing status. Payments received on nonaccruing loans are applied to principal or recognized as interest income, according to management's judgment as to the collectability of principal. Loans may be returned to accruing status when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal and interest, including principal previously charged off, is probable based on improvements in the borrower's financial condition or a sustained period of performance. 

For loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, discounts are accreted on either an individual basis for loans with unique characteristics or on a pool basis for groups of homogeneous loans. Accretion is discontinued when a loan with an individually attributed discount is placed on nonaccruing status. 

Loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may be modified in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). All TDRs are generally classified as nonaccruing, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Modifications generally consist of extension of payment terms or interest rate concessions and may result either voluntarily through negotiations with the borrower or involuntarily through court order. Generally, principal and accrued but unpaid interest is not voluntarily forgiven. 

Performing loans may be renewed under the then current collateral, debt service ratio and other underwriting standards. Nonaccruing loans may also be renewed and will remain classified as nonaccruing. 

Occasionally, loans, other than residential mortgage loans, may be held for sale in order to manage credit concentration. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value with gains or losses recognized in gain (loss) on assets. 

All loans are charged-off when the loan balance or a portion of the loan balance is no longer supported by the paying capacity of the borrower or when the required cash flow is reduced in a TDR. The charge-off amount is determined through an evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated quarterly and charge-offs are taken in the quarter in which the loss is identified. Non-risk graded loans that are past due between 60 days and 180 days , based on the loan product type, are charged off. Loans to borrowers whose personal obligation has been discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings are charged off within 60 days of notice of the bankruptcy filing, regardless of payment status. 

Loan origination and commitment fees and direct loan acquisition and origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan or over the commitment period, as applicable. Amortization does not anticipate loan prepayments. Net unamortized fees are recognized in full at time of payoff. 

Qualifying residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have been sold into GNMA pools. Under certain performance conditions specified in government programs, the Company has the right, but not the obligation to repurchase loans from GNMA pools. These loans no longer qualify for sale accounting and are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Guaranteed loans are considered to be impaired because we do not expect to receive all principal and interest based on the loan's contractual terms. A portion of the principal balance continues to be guaranteed; however, interest accrues at a curtailed rate as specified in the programs. The carrying value of these loans is reduced based on an estimate of expected cash flows discounted at the original note rate plus a liquidity spread. Guaranteed loans may be modified in TDRs in accordance with U.S. government agency guidelines. Interest continues to accrue at the modified rate. Guaranteed loans may either be resold into GNMA pools after a performance period specified by the programs or foreclosed and conveyed to the guarantors. 

Loans are disaggregated into portfolio segments and further disaggregated into classes. The portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops and documents a systematic method for determining its Allowance for Credit Losses. Classes are based on the risk characteristics of the loans and the Company's method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk 

The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk (collectively "Allowance for Credit Losses") is assessed by management based on an ongoing quarterly evaluation of the probable estimated losses inherent in the portfolio, including probable losses on both outstanding loans and unused commitments to provide financing. A consistent well-documented methodology has been developed and is applied by an independent Credit Administration department to assure consistency across the Company. 

The allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances attributed to impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover, general allowances based on estimated loss rates by loan class and nonspecific allowances based on factors that affect more than one portfolio segment. There were no changes to the methodology for estimating general allowances during 2019 or 2018 . 

Loans are considered to be impaired when it becomes probable that BOK Financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated individually for impairment. Substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain residential mortgage and personal loans are risk graded based on a quarterly evaluation of the borrowers' ability to repay. Certain commercial loans and most residential mortgage and personal loans are small balance, homogeneous pools of loans that are not risk graded. Non-risk graded loans are identified as impaired based on performance status. Generally, non-risk graded loans 90 days or more past due, modified in a troubled debt restructuring or in bankruptcy are considered to be impaired. 

Specific allowances for impaired loans are measured by an evaluation of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. The fair value of real property held as collateral is generally based on third party appraisals that conform to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, less estimated selling costs. Appraised values are on an &#8220;as-is&#8221; basis and generally are not adjusted by the Company. Updated appraisals are obtained at least annually or more frequently if market conditions indicate collateral values may have declined. Collateral value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. The value of other collateral is generally determined by our special assets staff based on projected liquidation cash flows under current market conditions. Collateral values and available cash resources that support impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. Historical statistics may be used as a practical way to estimate impairment in limited situations, such as when a collateral dependent loan is identified as impaired at the end of a reporting period until an appraisal of collateral value is received or a full assessment of future cash flows is completed. Estimates of future cash flows and collateral values require significant judgments and may be volatile. 

General allowances for unimpaired loans are based on an estimated loss rate by loan class. The appropriate historical gross loss rate for each loan class is determined by the greater of the current loss rate based on the most recent twelve months or average loss rate over the long-term credit cycle. Recoveries are not directly considered in the estimation of historical loss rates. Recoveries generally do not follow predictable patterns and are not received until well-after the charge-off date as a result of protracted legal actions. For risk graded loans, historical gross loss rates are adjusted for changes in risk grading. For each loan class, the current weighted average risk grade is compared to the long-term weighted average risk grade. This comparison determines whether credit risk in each loan class is increasing or decreasing. Historical loss rates are adjusted upward or downward in proportion to changes in average risk grading. General allowances for unimpaired loans also consider inherent risks identified for each loan class. Inherent risks consider loss rates that most appropriately represent the current credit cycle and other factors attributable to a specific loan class which have not yet been represented in the historical gross loss rates or risk grading. These factors include changes in commodity prices or engineering imprecision which may affect the value of reserves that secure our energy loan portfolio, construction risk that may affect commercial real estate loans, changes in regulations and public policy that may disproportionately impact health care loans and changes in loan products. 

Nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class. These factors include trends in the economy in our primary lending areas, concentration in large-balance loans and other relevant factors. 

An accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The appropriateness of the accrual is determined in the same manner as the allowance for loan losses. 

A provision for credit losses is charged against or credited to earnings in amounts necessary to maintain an appropriate Allowance for Credit Losses. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance when received. 

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets 

&#160; 

Real estate and other repossessed assets are acquired in partial or total forgiveness of loans. These assets are initially recognized at cost, which is determined by fair value at date of foreclosure less estimated disposal costs. They are subsequently carried at the lower of cost or current fair value less estimated disposal costs. Decreases in fair value below cost are recognized as asset-specific valuation allowances which may be reversed when supported by future increases in fair value. Subsequent increases in fair value may be used to reduce the allowance but not below zero. 

Fair values of real estate are based on &#8220;as is&#8221; appraisals which are updated at least annually or more frequently for certain asset types or assets located in certain distressed markets. Fair values based on appraisals are generally considered to be based on significant other observable inputs. The Company also considers decreases in listing price and other relevant information in quarterly evaluations and reduces the carrying value of real estate and other repossessed assets when necessary. Fair values based on list prices and other relevant information are generally considered to be based on significant unobservable inputs. Additional costs incurred to complete real estate and other repossessed assets may increase the carrying value, up to current fair value based on &#8220;as completed&#8221; appraisals. The fair value of mineral rights included in repossessed assets are generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. The value of other repossessed assets is generally determined by our special assets staff based on projected liquidation cash flows under current market conditions. 

Income generated by these assets is recognized as received. Operating expenses are recognized as incurred. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and other repossessed assets are based on the cash proceeds received less the cost basis of the asset, net of any valuation allowances. The estimated disposal costs of real estate and other repossessed assets are evaluated by the Company on an annual basis based on actual results. 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

&#160; 

BOK Financial regularly transfers financial assets as part of its mortgage banking activities and periodically may transfer other financial assets. Transfers are recorded as sales when the criteria for surrender of control are met. 

The Company has elected to carry certain residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value under the fair value option. Changes in fair value are recognized in net income as they occur. These loans are reported separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in fair value are recorded in Other Operating Revenue - Mortgage banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Fair value of conforming residential mortgage loans that will be sold to U.S. government agencies is based on sales commitments or market quotes considered Level 2 inputs. Fair value of mortgage loans that are unable to be sold to U.S. government agencies is based on Level 3 inputs using quoted prices of loans that are sold in securitization transactions with a liquidity discount applied. The fair value is corroborated with an independent third party on at least an annual basis. 

BOK Financial retains a repurchase obligation under underwriting representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans transferred and generally retains the right to service the loans. These are not credit obligations. The Company may incur a recourse obligation in limited circumstances. Separate accruals are recognized in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for repurchase and recourse obligations. These reserves reflect the estimated amount of probable loss the Company will incur as a result of repurchasing a loan, indemnifications, and other settlement resolutions. 

Repurchases of loans with an origination defect that are also credit impaired are considered collateral dependent and are initially recognized at net realizable value (appraised value less the cost to sell). The difference between unpaid principal balance and net realizable value is not accreted. Repurchases of loans with an origination defect that are not credit impaired are carried at fair value as of the repurchase date. Interest income continues to accrue on these loans and the discount is accreted over the estimated life of the loan. 

The Company may also choose to purchase GNMA loans once certain mandated delinquency criteria are met. The loans that are eligible and are chosen to be repurchased are initially recognized at fair value based on expected cash flow discounted using the average agency guaranteed debenture rates, average actual principal loss rates and liquidity premium. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

&#160; 

Mortgage servicing rights may be purchased or may be recognized when mortgage loans are originated and sold with servicing rights retained. All mortgage servicing rights are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur. 

Mortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets. A cash flow model is used to determine fair value. Key assumptions and estimates, including projected prepayment speeds and assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates, used by this model are based on current market sources. Assumptions used to value mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs. A separate third-party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated daily for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of BOK Financial's servicing portfolio. Fair value estimates from outside sources are received at least annually to corroborate the results of the valuation model. 

Premises and Equipment 

&#160; 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, including capitalized interest when appropriate, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. Useful lives range from 5 years to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 years to 10 years for software and related implementation costs, and 3 years to 10 years for furniture and equipment. Construction in progress represents facilities construction and data processing systems projects underway that have not yet been placed into service. Depreciation and amortization begin once the assets are placed into service. 

Repair and maintenance costs, including software maintenance and enhancement costs, are charged to expense as incurred. Software licensing costs are generally charged to expense as incurred. Software licensing costs are capitalized if the contractual right to take possession of the software exists and it is feasible to take possession without significant penalty. Capitalized costs are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the software or remaining contractual life of the license. 

Premises no longer used by the Company are transferred to real estate and other repossessed assets. The transferred amount is the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value less estimated disposal costs as of the transfer date. 

Premises and equipment includes rights to use leased facilities and equipment. Right of use assets are initially measured by the present value of future rent payments over lease terms, adjusted for rent concessions. Rent payments exclude both payments made for non-lease components such as services and variable lease payments other than payments dependent on an index at lease commencement. Lease term includes options reasonably certain to be exercised. The right of use assets and lease liabilities are amortized to achieve straight-line expense over the lease term. Upon lease modification, the right of use asset and liability are reassessed and remeasured. Right of use assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances change that indicate an impairment may be necessary. Leases less than twelve months are excluded from capitalization. 

Ongoing technology projects of significant size or length are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Accumulated costs are reviewed for projects or components of projects that do not support the value of the asset being developed. Findings of obsolescence, duplicate effort or other conditions that do not support the recorded value are impaired, with the cost of the impaired components being charged to current-year earnings. 

Federal and State Income Taxes 

&#160; 

BOK Financial and its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns. The subsidiaries provide for income taxes on a separate return basis and remit to BOK Financial amounts determined to be currently payable. BOK Financial is an agent for its subsidiaries under the Company's tax sharing agreements and has no ownership rights to any refunds received for the benefit of its subsidiaries. 

Current income tax expense or benefit is based on an evaluation that considers estimated taxable income, tax credits, and statutory federal and state income tax rates. The amount of current income tax expense or benefit recognized in any period may differ from amounts reported to taxing authorities. Annually, tax returns are filed with each jurisdiction where the Company conducts business and recognized current income tax expense or benefit is adjusted to the filed tax returns. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based upon the temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in statutory tax rates on the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized through income tax expense in the period the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized. 

BOK Financial has unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in accrued current income taxes payable, for the uncertain portion of recorded tax benefits and related interest. These uncertainties result from the application of complex tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations, primarily in state taxing jurisdictions. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed quarterly and may be adjusted through current income tax expense in future periods based on changing facts and circumstances, completion of examinations by taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations. Estimated penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. 

Employee Benefit Plans 

&#160; 

BOK Financial sponsors a defined contribution plan (&#8220;Thrift Plan&#8221;) and a defined benefit cash balance pension plan (&#8220;Pension Plan&#8221;). Employer contributions to the Thrift Plan, which matches employee contributions subject to percentage and years of service limits, are expensed when incurred. Pension Plan costs, which are based upon actuarial computations of current costs, are expensed annually. Pension Plan benefits were curtailed as of April 1, 2006. No participants may be added to the Pension Plan and no additional service benefits will be accrued. BOK Financial recognizes the funded status of its employee benefit plans. Adjustments required to recognize the Pension Plan's net funded status are made through accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. 

Share-Based Compensation Plans 

&#160; 

BOK Financial awards stock options and non-vested common shares as compensation to certain officers. The grant date fair value of stock options is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options generally have graded vesting over 7 years . Each tranche is considered a separate award for valuation and compensation cost recognition. Grant date fair value of non-vested shares is based on the then-current market value of BOK Financial common stock. Non-vested shares generally cliff vest in 3 years and are subject to a holding period after vesting of 2 years . 

Compensation cost is initially based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. Expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures over the vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur. Share-based compensation awarded to certain officers has performance conditions that affect the number of awards granted. Compensation cost is adjusted based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. 

Restricted stock units ("RSUs") may also be awarded for certain executives who have elected to defer income recognition upon vesting of their awards. RSUs are subject to the same vesting criteria as non-vested shares. The value of the awards will vary in amounts equal to changes in the fair value of an equal number of BOKF Financial common shares. 

Tax effects of share-based payments are recognized through tax expense. Dividends on non-vested shares are charged to retained earnings. Dividend equivalents on RSU's are charged to expense. 

Other Operating Revenue 

&#160; 

Fees and commissions revenue is generated through the sales of products, consisting primarily of financial instruments, and the performance of services for customers under contractual obligations. Revenue from providing services for customers is recognized at the time services are provided in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those services. Revenue is recognized based on the application of five steps: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Identify the contract with a customer 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Determine the transaction price 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

##TABLE_END 

For contracts with multiple performance obligations, individual performance obligations are accounted for separately if the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources readily available to the customer and the promise to transfer goods and services to the customer is separately identifiable in the contract. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. 

Revenue is recognized on a gross basis whenever we have primary responsibility and risk in providing the services or products to our customers and have discretion in establishing the price for the services or products. Revenue is recognized on a net basis whenever we act as an agent for products or services of others. 

Brokerage and trading revenue includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage, investment banking and insurance brokerage. Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains primarily related to sales of securities to institutional customers and related derivative contracts. Customer hedging revenue includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs including credit valuation adjustments, as necessary. We offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. These customer contracts are offset with contracts with selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize changes in market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Retail brokerage revenue represents fees and commissions earned on sales of fixed income securities, annuities, mutual funds and other financial instruments to retail customers. Investment banking revenue includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting and financial advisory services. Investment banking revenue also includes fees earned in conjunction with loan syndications. Insurance brokerage revenues represent fees and commissions earned on placement of insurance products with carriers for property and casualty and health coverage. 

Transaction card revenue includes merchant discount fees and electronic funds transfer network fees, net of interchange fees paid to card issuers and assessments paid to card networks. Merchant discount fees represent fees paid by customers for account management and electronic processing of card transactions. Merchant discount fees are recognized at the time the customer&#8217;s transactions are processed or other services are performed. The Company also maintains the TransFund electronic funds transfer network for the benefit of its members, which includes BOKF, NA. Electronic funds transfer fees are recognized as electronic transactions are processed on behalf of its members. 

&#160; 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue includes fees from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and administration services. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis at the time the services are performed and may be based on either the fair value of the account or the service provided. 

&#160; 

Deposit service charges and fees include commercial account service charges, overdraft fees, check card fee revenue and automated service charge and other deposit service fees. Fees are recognized at least quarterly in accordance with published deposit account agreements and disclosure statements for retail accounts or contractual agreements for commercial accounts. Item charges for overdraft or non-sufficient funds items are recognized as items are presented for payment. Account balance charges and activity fees are accrued monthly and collected in arrears. Commercial account activity fees may be offset by an earnings credit based on account balances. Check card fees represent interchange fees paid by a merchant bank for transactions processed from cards issued by the Company. Check card fees are recognized when transactions are processed. 

Mortgage banking revenue includes revenues recognized in conjunction with the origination, marketing and servicing of conventional and government-sponsored residential mortgage loans. Mortgage production revenue includes net realized gains (losses) on sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on residential mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage production revenue also includes changes in the fair value of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to residential mortgage loan commitments and forward sales contracts. Mortgage servicing revenue includes servicing fee income and late charges on loans serviced for others. 

Newly Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements 

The following is a summary of newly adopted and pending accounting pronouncements that may have a more than insignificant effect on the Company's financial statements. 

Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02") 

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Lessees are required to recognize an obligation for future lease payments measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset. The Company adopted the new standard January 1, 2019 through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods were not restated. BOKF elected to apply all practical expedients other than the lessee's practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components which would further gross up lease liability and the related right-of-use asset. The implementation of ASU 2016-02 increased the reported right-of-use asset and lease liability by $ 137 million . The effect on retained earnings was immaterial. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements ("ASU 2019-01") 

On March 5, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01 which amends certain aspects of leasing standard ASU 2016-02. ASU 2019-01 provides guidance for determining fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers. The ASU also requires depository and lending lessors within the scope of ASC 942 to classify principal payments received from sales-type and direct financing leases within "investing activities" on the statement of cash flows. For the two issues above, the ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein; however, early adoption is permitted. Additionally, ASU 2019-01 also clarifies interim disclosure requirements during transition and is effective with the original transition requirements in Topic 842. Adoption of ASU 2019-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost ("ASU 2016-13") 

On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 to provide more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost, effective for the Company's annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

The Company has established a CECL implementation team to evaluate the impact to the Company&#8217;s financial statements. The CECL implementation team, overseen by the Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer, has developed a project plan that incorporates input from various departments within the bank including Credit, Financial Reporting, Risk and Information Technology among others. The Audit and Credit Committees of the Board of Directors are periodically updated on project progress. The implementation team has completed the design of internal controls over the expected credit losses estimate and is formalizing control procedures, governance, and approval processes. This includes finalizing model validation, refinement of model assumptions and qualitative framework, and drafting policies, reporting, and disclosures. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments ("ASU 2019-04") 

On April 25, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 which clarifies certain aspects of the accounting for credit losses, hedging activities, and financial instruments addressed by ASUs 2016-13, 2017-12, and 2016-01, respectively. Significant amendments made to the provisions of ASU 2016-13 by ASU 2019-04 include providing certain alternatives for the measurement of the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable and clarifying steps entities should take when recording the transfer of loans or debt securities between measurement classification or categories. ASU 2019-04 further clarifies the expectation that entities include recoveries of financial assets in the calculation of the current expected credit losses allowance for both pools of financial assets and individual financial assets. Significant amendments made to the provisions of ASU 2017-12 by ASU 2019-04 include clarification on partial-term fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amortization of fair value hedge basis adjustments and disclosure of fair value hedge basis adjustments. Significant amendments made to provisions of ASU 2016-01 include clarification of the measurement alternative practice for equity securities and remeasurement of equity securities at historical exchange rates. ASU 2019-04 includes other amendments which clarify various provisions within the codification. ASU 2019-04 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein. Adoption of ASU 2019-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief ("ASU 2019-05") 

On May 15, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05 which provides transition relief for entities adopting the Board's credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13. ASU 2019-05 amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies to irrevocably elect, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, the fair value option for financial instruments that meet specific requirements and is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Adoption of ASU 2019-05 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326: Financial Instruments-Credit Losses ("ASU 2019-11") 

On November 27, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11 which revises certain aspects of new guidance on credit losses. Topics addressed include purchased credit-deteriorated assets, transition relief for troubled debt restructurings, disclosure relief for accrued interest receivable, and financial assets secured by collateral maintenance provisions. ASU 2019-11 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Adoption of ASU 2019-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ("ASU 2019-12") 

On December 18, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within. Adoption of ASU 2019-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

##TABLE_END

Based on evaluations of impaired securities as of December 31, 2019 , the Company does not intend to sell any impaired available for sale securities before fair value recovers to the current amortized cost and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell impaired securities before fair value recovers, which may be maturity. 

No other-than-temporary impairment losses were recorded in earnings during 2019 and none were recorded in 2018 . Cumulative other-than-temporary impairment on available for sale securities was $ 36 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 45 million at December 31, 2018 . The decrease compared to the prior year was due to sales during 2019. 

Fair Value Option Securities 

&#160; 

Fair value option securities represent securities which the Company has elected to carry at fair value and are separately identified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings as they occur. Certain residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and derivative contracts are held as an economic hedge of the mortgage servicing rights. 

The fair value and net unrealized gain (loss) included in fair value option securities is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START &#160;

Excludes residential mortgage loans guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government . 

##TABLE_END 

At December 31, 2019 , loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 6.8 billion or 31 % of the total loan portfolio. Loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 3.5 billion or 16 % of our total loan portfolio. Loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Colorado totaled $ 2.8 billion or 13 % of our total loan portfolio. Loans for which the collateral location is not relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans, are distributed by the borrower&#8217;s primary operating location. These geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas. At December 31, 2018 , loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 6.4 billion or 30 % of the loan portfolio and loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 3.5 billion or 16 % of the loan portfolio. 

Commercial 

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent on-going relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer&#8217;s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer&#8217;s assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interest in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the on-going cash flow from operations of the customer&#8217;s business. Inherent lending risk is centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies. 

At December 31, 2019 , commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 4.7 billion or 33 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. Commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 2.0 billion or 14 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. Commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Colorado totaled $ 2.0 billion or 14 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. The commercial loan portfolio segment is further divided into loan classes. The services loan class totaled $ 3.1 billion or 14 % of total loans. Approximately $ 1.5 billion of loans in the services class consisted of loans with individual balances of less than $ 10 million . Businesses included in the services class include commercial services, Native American tribal governments, financial services, entertainment and recreation and education. The energy loan class totaled $ 4.0 billion or 18 % of total loans, including $ 3.1 billion of outstanding loans to energy producers. Approximately 58 % of committed production loans were secured by properties primarily producing oil and 42 % are secured by properties producing natural gas. The healthcare loan class totaled $ 3.0 billion or 14 % of total loans. The healthcare loan class consists primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers. 

At December 31, 2018 , commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Texas totaled $ 4.1 billion or 30 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment and commercial loans with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma totaled $ 2.2 billion or 16 % of the commercial loan portfolio segment. The energy loan class totaled $ 3.6 billion or 17 % of total loans, including $ 2.9 billion of outstanding loans to energy producers. At December 31, 2018 , approximately 57 % of committed production loans were secured by properties primarily producing oil and 43 % were secured by properties producing natural gas. The services loan class totaled $ 3.3 billion or 15 % of total loans. Approximately $ 2.3 billion of loans in the services category consisted of loans with individual balances of less than $ 10 million . The healthcare loan class totaled $ 2.8 billion or 13 % of total loans. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate loans are for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes primarily within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies. 

At December 31, 2019 , 24 % of commercial real estate loans are secured by properties primarily located in the Dallas and Houston areas of Texas. An additional 11 % of commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located primarily in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. At December 31, 2018 , 26 % of commercial real estate loans were secured by properties in Texas, 9 % of commercial real estate loans were secured by properties in Oklahoma. 

Residential Mortgage and Personal 

Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. Residential mortgage loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer&#8217;s primary residence. Personal loans consist primarily of loans secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as other unsecured loans. Residential mortgage and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. Residential mortgage loans retained in the Company&#8217;s portfolio are primarily composed of various mortgage programs to support customer relationships including jumbo mortgage loans, non-builder construction loans and special loan programs for high net worth individuals and certain professionals. Jumbo loans may be fixed or variable rate and are fully amortizing. Jumbo loans generally conform to government sponsored entity standards, except that the loan size exceeds maximums required under these standards. These loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 720 and a maximum debt-to-income ratio (&#8220;DTI&#8221;) of 38 % . Loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios are tiered from 60 % to 100 % , depending on the market. Special mortgage programs include fixed and variable fully amortizing loans tailored to the needs of certain healthcare professionals. Variable rate loans are fully indexed at origination and may have fixed rates for 3 years to 10 years , then adjust annually thereafter. 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , residential mortgage loans included $ 198 million and $ 191 million , respectively, of loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools. These loans either have been repurchased or are eligible to be repurchased by the Company when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Although payments on these loans generally are past due more than 90 days, interest continues to accrue based on the government guarantee. 

Home equity loans totaled $ 829 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 917 million at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , 63 % of the home equity loan portfolio was comprised of first lien loans and 37 % of the home equity portfolio was comprised of junior lien loans. Junior lien loans were distributed 35 % to amortizing term loans and 65 % to revolving lines of credit. At December 31, 2018 , 65 % of the home equity portfolio was comprised of first lien loans and 35 % of the home equity loan portfolio was comprised of junior lien loans. Junior lien loans were distributed 36 % to amortizing term loans and 64 % to revolving lines of credit. Home equity loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 700 and a maximum DTI of 40%. The maximum loan amount available for our home equity loan products is generally $ 400 thousand . Revolving loans have a 5 year revolving period followed by 15 year term of amortizing repayments. Interest-only home equity loans may not be extended for any additional revolving time. All other home equity loans may be extended at management's discretion for an additional 5 year revolving term subject to an update of certain credit information. 

At December 31, 2019 , 28 % of residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located in Oklahoma, 28 % of residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located in Texas and 15 % of residential mortgage are secured by properties located in Colorado. At December 31, 2018 , 28 % of residential mortgage were secured by properties in Texas, 26 % of residential mortgage loans were secured by properties in Oklahoma and 19 % of residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in Colorado. 

Credit Commitments 

&#160; 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. At December 31, 2019 , outstanding commitments totaled $ 11.1 billion . Because some commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. BOK Financial uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does loans. 

The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based upon management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the borrower. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Because the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments, BOK Financial uses the same credit policies in evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer. Additionally, BOK Financial uses the same evaluation process in obtaining collateral on standby letters of credit as it does for loan commitments. The term of these standby letters of credit is defined in each commitment and typically corresponds with the underlying loan commitment. At December 31, 2019 , outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $ 646 million . Commercial letters of credit are used to facilitate customer trade transactions with the drafts being drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated. At December 31, 2019 , outstanding commercial letters of credit totaled $ 1.2 million . 

Allowances for Credit Losses 

BOK Financial maintains an allowance for loan losses and an accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk is maintained at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated losses associated with credit instruments that are not currently recognized as assets such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit or guarantees. As discussed in greater detail in Note 7 , the Company also has separate accruals related to off-balance sheet credit risk related to residential mortgage loans previously sold with full or partial recourse and for residential mortgage loans sold to government sponsored agencies under standard representations and warranties. 

The allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances attributed to impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover, general allowances for unimpaired loans based on estimated loss rates by loan class and nonspecific allowances based on general economic conditions, concentration in loans with large balances and other relevant factors. 

The activity in the allowance for loan losses and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk related to loan commitments and standby letters of credit for the year ended December 31, 2019 is summarized as follows (in thousands):

Credit Quality Indicators 

The Company utilizes loan class and risk grading as primary credit quality indicators. Substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain residential mortgage and personal loans are risk graded based on a quarterly evaluation of the borrowers&#8217; ability to repay the loans. Certain commercial loans and most residential mortgage and personal loans are small, homogeneous pools that are not risk graded. 

The allowance for loan losses and recorded investment of the related loans by portfolio segment for risk graded and non-risk graded loans at December 31, 2019 is as follows (in thousands):

##TABLE_END

Loans are considered to be performing if they are in compliance with the original terms of the agreement which is consistent with the regulatory guideline of &#8220;pass.&#8221; Performing also includes loans considered to be &#8220;other loans especially mentioned&#8221; by regulatory guidelines and all residential mortgage loans guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government that continue to accrue interest based on criteria of the guarantor's programs. Other loans especially mentioned are currently performing in compliance with the original terms of the agreement but may have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention, consistent with regulatory guidelines. 

The risk grading process identified certain loans that have a well-defined weakness (e.g. inadequate debt service coverage or liquidity or marginal capitalization; repayment may depend on collateral or other risk mitigation) that may jeopardize liquidation of the debt and represent a greater risk due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. This is consistent with the regulatory guideline for &#8220;substandard.&#8221; Because the borrowers are still performing in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements, these loans were not placed in nonaccruing status. 

Nonaccruing loans represent loans for which full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements is uncertain. This is substantially the same criteria used to determine whether a loan is impaired and includes certain loans considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; and all loans considered &#8220;doubtful&#8221; by regulatory guidelines.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 1 &#160; 

All permanent mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies are considered impaired as we do not expect full collection of contractual principal and interest. At December 31, 2019 , $ 6.1 million of these loans are nonaccruing and $ 192 million are accruing based on the guarantee by U.S. government agencies. 

##TABLE_END 

Generally, no interest income is recognized on impaired loans until all principal balances, including amounts charged-off, have been recovered.

( 7 ) Mortgage Banking Activities 

Residential Mortgage Loan Production 

The Company originates, markets and services conventional and government-sponsored residential mortgage loans. Generally, conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans are held for sale in the secondary market and non-conforming and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are held for investment. The volume of mortgage loans originated for sale and secondary market prices are the primary drivers of originating and marketing revenue. 

Residential mortgage loan commitments are generally outstanding for 60 to 90 days, which represents the typical period from commitment to originate a residential mortgage loan to when the closed loan is sold to an investor. Residential mortgage loan commitments are subject to both credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed through underwriting policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, which are generally accepted by the secondary loan markets. Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is partially managed through forward sales of residential mortgage-backed securities and forward sales contracts. These latter contracts set the price for loans that will be delivered in the next 60 to 90 days. 

The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans held for sale, notional amounts of derivative contracts related to residential mortgage loan commitments and forward contract sales and their related fair values included in Mortgage loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were (in thousands):

BOK Financial maintains control over the securities underlying overnight repurchase agreements and generally transfers control over securities underlying longer-term dealer repurchase agreements to the respective counterparty. 

##TABLE_END 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks are used for funding purposes. In accordance with policies of the Federal Home Loan Banks, BOK Financial has granted a blanket pledge of eligible assets (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities, 1-4 family loans and multifamily loans) as collateral for these advances. The Federal Home Loan Banks have issued letters of credit totaling $ 661 million to secure BOK Financial&#8217;s obligations to depositors of public funds. The unused credit available to BOK Financial at December 31, 2019 pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank&#8217;s collateral policies is $ 4.9 billion . 

In 2016, BOK Financial issued $ 150 million of subordinated debt that will mature on June 30, 2056 . Interest on this debt bears an interest rate of 5.375 % , payable quarterly. On June 30, 2021 , BOK Financial will have the option to redeem the debt at the principal amount plus accrued interest, subject to regulatory approval. 

As a result of the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, we obtained $ 60 million of subordinated debt issued in June 2015 that will mature on June 25, 2030 . This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.625 % through June 2025 and thereafter, the notes will bear interest at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 3.17% . The debt contains a call option that allows for repayment prior to contractual maturity. The call option is available on June 25, 2025 and quarterly thereafter at 100% of the principal amount. 

Also through CoBiz Financial, we acquired junior subordinated debentures split across three issuance tranches. Junior subordinated debentures of $ 21 million will mature September 17, 2033 and bear an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.95% that resets quarterly. Junior subordinated debentures of $ 31 million will mature on July 23, 2034 and bear an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.60% that resets quarterly. Junior subordinated debentures of $ 20 million will mature on September 30, 2035 and bear an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.45% that resets quarterly. The junior subordinated debentures are subject to early redemption prior to maturity. 

BOK Financial Securities, Inc. may borrow funds from Pershing, LLC ("Pershing"), a clearing broker/dealer and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon, for the purposes of financing securities purchases or to facilitate funding of investment banking activities, on terms to be negotiated at the time of the borrowing. BOK Financial Securities, Inc. had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019 and none at December 31, 2018 . 

The Company has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is payable at rates contractually due to investors.

Of the above unrecognized tax benefits, $ 14.7 million , if recognized, would have affected the effective tax rate. 

BOK Financial recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company recognized $ 2.2 million for 2019 , $ 1.7 million for 2018 and $ 1.2 million for 2017 in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $ 5.6 million and $ 5.0 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Federal statutes remain open for federal tax returns filed in the previous three reporting periods. Various state income tax statutes remain open for the previous three to six reporting periods. 

( 11 ) Employee Benefits 

BOK Financial sponsors a defined benefit cash balance Pension Plan for all employees who satisfy certain age and service requirements. Pension Plan benefits were curtailed as of April 1, 2006. No participants may be added to the plan and no additional service benefits will be accrued. Interest continues to accrue on employees' account balances at a variable rate tied to the five-year trailing average of five-year U.S. Treasury securities plus 1.5 % . The rate has a floor of 3.0 % and a ceiling of 5.0 % . The 2019 quarterly variable rates ranged from 3.32 % to 3.40 % . 

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, respectively, were $ 24.5 million and $ 36.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 24.5 million and $ 33.6 million at December 31, 2018 . The net periodic benefit credit was $ 815 thousand for December 31, 2019 , $ 583 thousand for December 31, 2018 and $ 704 thousand for December 31, 2017 . Total expected future benefit payments related to the Pension Plan were $ 27.8 million at December 31, 2019 .

Assets of the Pension Plan consist primarily of shares in the Cavanal Hill Active Core Fund. The stated objective of this fund is to provide an attractive total return with a well-balanced mix of equities and bonds. The typical portfolio mix is approximately 60 % equities and 40 % bonds. The net asset value of shares in the Cavanal Hill Funds is reported daily based on market quotations for the Fund&#8217;s securities. Management considers the Fund's recent and long-term performance as indicators when setting the expected return on plan assets. No minimum contribution was required for 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . 

Employee contributions to the Thrift Plan are eligible for Company matching equal to 6 % of base compensation, as defined in the plan. The Company-provided matching contribution rates range from 50 % for employees with less than 4 years of service to 200 % for employees with 15 or more years of service. Additionally, a maximum Company-provided, non-elective annual contribution of up to $ 750 per participant is provided for employees whose annual base compensation is less than $ 40,000 . Participants may direct investments in their accounts to a variety of options, including a BOK Financial common stock fund and Cavanal Hill funds. Employer contributions, which are invested in accordance with the participant&#8217;s investment options, vest over five years . Thrift Plan expenses were $ 27.6 million for 2019 , $ 25.1 million for 2018 and $ 22.8 million for 2017 . 

( 12 ) Share-Based Compensation Plans 

The shareholders and Board of Directors of BOK Financial have approved various share-based compensation plans. An independent compensation committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of awards granted to the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. Share-based compensation is granted to other officers and employees as determined by the Chief Executive Officer.

( 14 ) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 

Litigation Contingencies 

As a member of Visa, BOK Financial is obligated for a proportionate share of certain covered litigation losses incurred by Visa under a retrospective responsibility plan. A contingent liability was recognized for the Company&#8217;s share of Visa&#8217;s covered litigation liabilities. Visa funded an escrow account to cover litigation claims, including covered litigation losses under the retrospective responsibility plan, with proceeds from its initial public offering in 2008 and from available cash. 

BOK Financial currently owns 252,233 Visa Class B shares which are convertible into 409,324 shares of Visa Class A shares after the final settlement of all covered litigation. Class B shares may be diluted in the future if the escrow fund is not adequate to cover future covered litigation costs. No value has been currently assigned to the Class B shares. 

On June 24, 2015, BOKF, NA received a complaint alleging that an employee had colluded with a bond issuer and an 

individual in misusing revenues pledged to municipal bonds for which BOKF, NA served as trustee under the bond indenture. The Company conducted an investigation and concluded that employees in one of its Corporate Trust offices had, with respect to a single group of affiliated bond issuances, violated Company policies and procedures by waiving financial covenants, granting forbearances and accepting, without disclosure to the bondholders, debt service payments from sources other than pledged revenues. The relationship manager was terminated. The Company reported the circumstances to, and cooperated with an investigation by, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 

On December 28, 2015, in an action brought by the SEC, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a judgment against the principals involved in issuing the bonds, precluding the principals from denying the alleged violations of the federal securities laws and requiring the principals to pay all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and other amounts required under the bond documents, less the value of the facilities securing repayment of the bonds, subject to oversight by a court appointed monitor (&#8220;Payment Plan&#8221;). 

On September 7, 2016, BOKF, NA agreed, and the SEC entered, a consent order finding that BOKF, NA had violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and requiring BOKF, NA to disgorge $ 1,067,721 of fees and pay a civil penalty of $ 600,000 . BOKF, NA disgorged the fees and paid the penalty. 

On August 26, 2016, BOKF, NA was sued in the United States District Court for New Jersey by two bondholders in a putative class action on behalf of all holders of the bonds alleging BOKF, NA participated in the fraudulent sale of securities by the principals. The New Jersey Federal District Action has been stayed until March 20, 2020. On September 14, 2016, BOKF, NA was sued in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma by 19 bondholders alleging BOKF, NA participated in the fraudulent sale of securities by the principals. The Tulsa County District Court Action is pending on BOKF, NA&#8217;s motion to dismiss. Four separate small groups of bondholders filed arbitration complaints with the Financial Institutions Regulatory Association respecting the bonds and other bonds for which BOKF, NA served as indenture trustee. BOKF, NA challenged the FINRA proceedings in the United States District Court of Nevada. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held BOKF, NA was not subject to FINRA jurisdiction. The four FINRA complaints were then dismissed. 

On July 9, 2019, the New Jersey Federal District Court terminated the Payment Plan except with respect to facilities then under contract to be sold as to which the Payment Plan continued until January 17, 2020. On January 8, 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered judgment against the principal individual and his wife for $ 36,805,051 in principal amount and $ 10,937,831 in pre-judgment interest. Management is no longer able to conclude that the individual principal and his wife will be successful in paying the obligations they have to pay the bonds in full. Under all circumstances, the obligation of the principals to repay the bonds continues as an obligation not dischargeable in bankruptcy. If the individual principal and his wife do not have the financial ability to pay the bonds in full, a bondholder loss could become probable. Management has been advised by counsel that BOKF, NA has valid defenses to claims of bondholders and that no loss to the company is probable. No provision for losses has been made at this time. BOKF, NA estimates that, upon sale of all facilities securing payment of the bonds, including those currently under contract and those not currently under contract, approximately $ 20 million will remain outstanding. A reasonable estimate cannot be made of the amount of any bondholder loss, though the amount of bondholder loss could be material to the company in the event a loss to the company becomes probable. 

On March 5, 2018, BOKF, NA was sued in the Fulton, Georgia County District Court by the administratrix of a deceased resident who had sued for and obtained a judgment for wrongful death against one of the operators of a nursing home financed by one of the bonds which are the subject of the litigation discussed above. The judgment is alleged to total approximately $ 8 million in principal and interest at this time. Plaintiff alleges that BOKF, in its capacity as indenture trustee for the bonds, colluded with the borrower and others to defraud creditors of the nursing home by misleading the public about the solvency of the nursing home. Plaintiff alleges that this conduct has prevented her from collecting on her judgment. BOKF, NA is advised by counsel that BOKF, NA has valid defenses to the plaintiffs&#8217; claims and no loss is probable. 

On March 14, 2017, BOKF, NA was sued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma by bondholders in a second putative class action representing a different set of municipal securities. The bondholders in this second action allege two individuals purchased facilities from the principals who are the subject of the SEC New Jersey proceedings by means of the fraudulent sale of $ 60 million of municipal securities for which BOKF, NA also served as indenture trustee. The bondholders allege BOKF, NA failed to disclose that the seller of the purchased facilities had engaged in the conduct complained of in the New Jersey action. BOKF, NA properly performed all duties as indenture trustee of this second set of municipal securities, timely commenced proceedings against the issuer of the securities when default occurred, is cooperating with the SEC in actions against the two principals, is not a target of the SEC proceedings, and has been advised by counsel that BOKF, NA has valid defenses to the claims of these bondholders. Management is advised by counsel that a loss is not probable and that the loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 

On March 7, 2017, a plaintiff filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging an extended overdraft fee charged by BOKF, NA is interest and exceeds permitted rates. On September 18, 2018, the District Court dismissed the Texas action and the plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which heard argument on October 8, 2019. On August 22, 2018, a plaintiff filed a second putative class action in the United States District Court for New Mexico making the same allegations as the Texas action. The District Court dismissed the plaintiff&#8217;s action. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and the action is pending on that motion. Management is advised by counsel that a loss is not probable in either the now dismissed Texas action or the New Mexico action and that the loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 

On July 6, 2018, a plaintiff served a petition in a putative class action in the Oklahoma District Court for Tulsa County Oklahoma alleging BOKF, NA breached its Demand Deposit Agreements by charging overdraft and not sufficient funds fees to deposit accounts on the day of the transaction triggering the fee and by the bank's debit hold process causing overdraft fees. Management is advised by counsel that a loss is not probable and that the loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 

In the ordinary course of business, BOK Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes, based upon the opinion of counsel, that the actions and liability or loss, if any, resulting from the final outcomes of the proceedings, will not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Alternative Investment Commitments

Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share at the election of the Board of Directors and on any question arising at any shareholders&#8217; meeting and to receive dividends when and as declared. Additionally, regulations restrict the ability of national &#160; banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends. 

&#160; 

Subsidiary Banks 

&#160; 

The amounts of dividends that BOK Financial&#8217;s subsidiary bank can declare and the amounts of loans the subsidiary bank can extend to affiliates are limited by various federal banking regulations and state corporate law. Generally, dividends declared during a calendar year are limited to net profits, as defined, for the year plus retained profits for the preceding two years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. 

Regulatory Capital 

BOK Financial and the subsidiary bank is subject to various capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material effect on BOK Financial's operations. These capital requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 

New capital rules were effective for BOK Financial on January 1, 2015. Components of these rules phased in through January 1, 2019. A bank falling below the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and executive bonus payments. For a banking institution to qualify as well capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier I, Total and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.5 % , 8 % , 10 % and 5 % , respectively. Tier I capital consists primarily of common stockholders' equity, excluding unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities, less goodwill, core deposit premiums and certain other intangible assets. Total capital consists primarily of Tier I capital plus preferred stock, subordinated debt and allowances for credit losses, subject to certain limitations. The subsidiary banks exceeded the regulatory definition of well capitalized as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

AOCI includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale ("AFS") securities and non-credit related unrealized losses on AFS securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recorded in earnings. Unrealized losses on employee benefit plans will be reclassified into income as pension plan costs are recognized over the remaining service period of plan participants. Gains and losses in AOCI are net of deferred income taxes. 

A rollforward of the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is included as follows (in thousands):

( 17 ) Reportable Segments 

BOK Financial operates three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products to small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business customers served through the consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private bank services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities. 

In addition to its lines of business, BOK Financial has a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds Management and Other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business. 

BOK Financial allocates resources and evaluates performance of its lines of business after allocation of funds, actual net credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes on statutory rates. The allocation for the prior comparable periods have been revised on a comparable basis. 

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar duration. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk. 

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is based on rates which approximate the wholesale market rates for funds with similar duration and re-pricing characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their re-pricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the short-term LIBOR rates and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short-term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years. 

Substantially all revenue is from domestic customers. No single external customer accounts for more than 10% of total revenue. 

Net loans charged off and provision for credit losses represents net loans charged off as attributed to the lines of business and the provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs attributed to Funds Management and Other. 

The operations of CoBiz, acquired on October 1, 2018 were allocated to the operating segments in the second quarter of 2019. Prior to April 1, 2019, CoBiz operations were included in Funds Management and other.

( 19 ) Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. Certain assets and liabilities are recorded in the Company&#8217;s financial statements at fair value. Some are recorded on a recurring basis and some on a non-recurring basis. 

For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. A hierarchy for fair value has been established which categorizes into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels are as follows: 

Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets or Liabilities (Level 1) - fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) - fair value is based on significant other observable inputs which are generally determined based on a single price for each financial instrument provided to us by an applicable third-party pricing service and is based on one or more of the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Quoted prices for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities in active markets; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Other inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs. 

##TABLE_END 

Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) - fair value is based upon model-based valuation techniques for which at least one significant assumption is not observable in the market. 

Transfers between levels are recognized as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers in or out of quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to significant other observable inputs or significant unobservable inputs during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Transfers between significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in the summary of changes in recurring fair values measured using unobservable inputs. Additionally, $208 million of held-to-maturity other debt securities were transferred from significant other observable inputs to significant unobservable inputs at December 31, 2018 due to a lack of currently available observable inputs. 

The underlying methods used by the third-party pricing services are considered in determining the primary inputs used to determine fair values. Management has evaluated the methodologies employed by the third-party pricing services by comparing the price provided by the pricing service with other sources, including brokers' quotes, sales or purchases of similar instruments and discounted cash flows to establish a basis for reliance on the pricing service values. Significant differences between the pricing service provided value and other sources are discussed with the pricing service to understand the basis for their values. Based on all observable inputs, management may adjust prices obtained from third-party pricing services to more appropriately reflect the prices that would be received to sell assets or paid to transfer liabilities in orderly transactions in the current market. No significant adjustments were made to prices provided by third-party pricing services at December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

See Note 3 for detail of fair value of derivative contracts by contract type. Derivative contracts in a net asset position that were valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (Level 1) are exchange-traded interest rate, energy and agricultural derivative contracts, net of cash margin. Derivative contracts in a net liability position that were valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (Level 1) are exchange-traded interest rate derivative contracts, fully offset by cash margin. 

##TABLE_END 

Following is a description of the Company's valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis: 

Securities 

The fair values of trading, available for sale and fair value option securities are based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, when available. If quoted prices for identical instruments are not available, fair values are based on significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices of comparable instruments or interest rates and credit spreads, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds and loss severities. 

The fair value of certain available for sale and held-to-maturity municipal and other debt securities may be based on significant unobservable inputs. These significant unobservable inputs include limited observed trades, projected cash flows, current credit rating of the issuers and, when applicable, the insurers of the debt and observed trades of similar debt. Discount rates are primarily based on reference to interest rate spreads on comparable securities of similar duration and credit rating as determined by the nationally-recognized rating agencies adjusted for a lack of trading volume. Significant unobservable inputs are developed by investment securities professionals involved in the active trading of similar securities. A summary of significant inputs used to value these securities follows. A management committee composed of senior members from the Company's Capital Markets, Risk Management and Finance departments assess the appropriateness of these inputs quarterly. 

Derivatives 

All derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for exchange-traded contracts are based on quoted prices. Fair values for over-the-counter interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange contracts are based on valuations provided either by third-party dealers in the contracts, quotes provided by independent pricing services, or a third-party provided pricing model that uses significant other observable market inputs. 

Credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of derivative instruments. Management determines fair value adjustments based on various risk factors including but not limited to counterparty credit rating or equivalent loan grading, derivative contract notional size, price volatility of the underlying commodity, duration of the derivative contracts and expected loss severity. Expected loss severity is based on historical losses for similarly risk graded commercial loan customers. Decreases in counterparty credit rating or grading and increases in price volatility and expected loss severity all tend to increase the credit quality adjustment which reduces the fair value of asset contracts. 

We also consider our own credit risk in determining the fair value of derivative contracts. Changes in our credit rating would affect the fair value of our derivative liabilities. In the event of a credit downgrade, the fair value of our derivative liabilities would increase. 

Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair values of conforming residential mortgage loans held for sale are based upon quoted market prices of such loans sold in securitization transactions, including related unfunded loan commitments. The fair value of mortgage loans that are unable to be sold to U.S. government agencies is determined using quoted prices of loans that are sold in securitization transactions with a liquidity discount applied. 

The following represents the changes related to assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (in thousands):

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include pension plan assets, which are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments, collateral for certain impaired loans and real property and other assets acquired to satisfy loans, which are based primarily on comparisons to completed sales of similar assets. 

The following represents the carrying value of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and related losses recorded during the year. The carrying value represents only those assets with the balance sheet date for which the fair value was adjusted during the year:

##TABLE_END

The fair value of collateral-dependent impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets and the related fair value adjustments are generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals. Our appraisal review policies require appraised values to be supported by observed inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on significant unobservable inputs. Non-recurring fair value measurements of collateral-dependent impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets based on significant unobservable inputs are generally due to estimates of current fair values between appraisal dates. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry. Non-recurring fair value measurements of collateral dependent loans secured by mineral rights are generally determined by our internal staff of engineers on projected cash flows under current market conditions and are based on significant unobservable inputs. Projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Assets are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current prices with existing conventional equipment, operating methods and costs. Significant unobservable inputs are developed by asset management and workout professionals and approved by senior Credit Administration executives.

The table above excludes the initial measurement of assets and liabilities that were acquired as part of the CoBiz acquisition in October 1, 2018. These assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair value upon acquisition in accordance with U.S. GAAP and were not re-measured during the periods presented unless specifically required by U.S. GAAP. Acquisition date fair values represent either Level 2 fair value measurements (investment securities, deposits, property, equipment, and debt) or Level 3 fair value measurements (loans and core deposit intangible assets). 

The fair value of pension plan assets was approximately $ 36 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 34 million at December 31, 2018 , determined by significant other observable inputs. Fair value adjustments of pension plan assets along with changes in the projected benefit obligation are recognized in other comprehensive income.

Because no market exists for certain of these financial instruments and management does not intend to sell these financial instruments, the fair values shown in the tables above may not represent values at which the respective financial instruments could be sold individually or in the aggregate at the given reporting date. 

Fair Value Election 

As more fully disclosed in Note 2 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to carry all U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities held as economic hedges against changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and all residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognized in earnings.
