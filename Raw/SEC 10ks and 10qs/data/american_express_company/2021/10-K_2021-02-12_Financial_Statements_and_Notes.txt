 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and includes those policies and procedures that: 

&#8226; Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets; 

&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control &#8212;Integrated Framework (2013). 

Based on management&#8217;s assessment and those criteria, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report appearing on the following page on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders&#8217; equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Reserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans 

As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management&#8217;s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&#38;S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. In estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company&#8217;s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&#38;S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&#38;S Period, the Company&#8217;s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&#38;S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&#38;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&#38;S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management&#8217;s methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management&#8217;s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&#38;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&#38;S Period. 

Membership Rewards Liability 

As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management&#8217;s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. The URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management, (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge and (iii) the estimate of the WAC involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating the methodology. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management&#8217;s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness, (iii) evaluating management&#8217;s methodology for determining the WAC assumption and (iv) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management&#8217;s estimate.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. 

We consolidate entities in which we hold a &#8220;controlling financial interest.&#8221; For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees&#8217; operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity&#8217;s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE&#8217;s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. 

Entities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar transactions of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate at the date of the transaction; revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders&#8217; equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency are reported in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management&#8217;s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. 

INCOME STATEMENT 

Discount Revenue 

Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant&#8217;s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. 

The card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network. 

In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. 

Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. 

Net Card Fees 

Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 9). 

Other Fees and Commissions 

Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. 

Contra-revenue 

Payments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. 

Interest Income 

Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. 

Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security&#8217;s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. 

Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. 

Marketing and Business Development 

Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are payments to our cobrand partners, Card Member statement credits for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets, and certain payments to GNS card issuing partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. 

Card Member Rewards 

We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cobrand and cash back). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. We record a Card Member rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. Pursuant to cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner&#8217;s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

BALANCE SHEET 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. 

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to 

completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. 

This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment. 

Under the quantitative assessment, the first step identifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then a test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. 

When measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies&#8217; multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units&#8217; actual results. 

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. 

Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software&#8217;s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets. 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. 

Leases 

We have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.

RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance related to the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The guidance, effective for reporting periods through December 31, 2022, provides accounting relief for contract modifications that replace an interest rate impacted by reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR) with a new alternative reference rate. The guidance is applicable to investment securities, receivables, loans, debt, leases, derivatives and hedge accounting elections and other contractual arrangements. We adopted the guidance as of March 31, 2020, with no material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There were no significant changes to our accounting policies, business processes or internal controls as a result of adopting the new guidance. 

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit reserving methodology, applicable to certain financial instruments, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology under a modified retrospective transition. The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of the financial instrument, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. Upon implementation, total loan reserves increased by $ 1,663 million and total receivable reserves decreased by $ 493 million, along with the associated current and deferred tax impact of $ 288 million, and an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings, net of tax, of $ 882 million. There were no material changes to our business processes or internal controls as a result of adopting the new guidance. Refer to Note 3 for additional information on how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology. 

In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new methodology replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model and requires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security&#8217;s fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security, when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. There was no financial impact related to this implementation. Refer to Note 4 for additional information. 

NOTE 2 

LOANS AND CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES 

Our lending and charge payment card products result in the generation of Card Member loans and Card Member receivables. We also extend credit to consumer and commercial customers through non-card financing products, resulting in Other loans. Reserves for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology, while comparative information continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology in effect for prior periods. 

CARD MEMBER AND OTHER LOANS 

Card Member loans are recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent revolving amounts due on lending card products, as well as amounts due from charge Card Members who utilize the Pay Over Time features on their account and revolve a portion of the outstanding balance by entering into a revolving payment arrangement with us. These loans have a range of terms such as credit limits, interest rates, fees and payment structures, which can be revised over time based on new information about Card Members, and in accordance with applicable regulations and the respective product&#8217;s terms and conditions. Card Members holding revolving loans are typically required to make monthly payments based on pre-established amounts and the amounts that Card Members choose to revolve are subject to finance charges. 

Card Member loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees. Our policy generally is to cease accruing interest on a Card Member loan at the time the account is written off, and establish reserves for interest that we believe will not be collected. 

Other loans are recorded at the time any extension of credit is provided to consumer and commercial customers for non-card financing products. These loans have a range of fixed terms such as interest rates, fees and repayment periods. Borrowers are typically required to make pre-established monthly payments over the term of the loan. Non-card financing products are not associated with a Card Member agreement, and instead are governed by a separate borrowing relationship. Other loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses, and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees. 

Card Member loans by segment and Other loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of:

CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES 

Card Member receivables are also recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent amounts due on charge card products. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics, a Card Member&#8217;s most recent credit information and spend patterns. 

Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. Card Member receivable balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related accrued fees.

(a) Global Corporate Payments (GCP) reflects global, large and middle market corporate accounts. Delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member&#8217;s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan or receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b). 

(b) Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances.

(a) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because we consider uncollectible interest and/or fees in estimating our reserves for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. 

(b) Net write-off rate based on principal losses only is not available due to system constraints. 

(c) For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of total was 0.6 % and 0.8 % for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

(d) Net loss ratio was the credit quality indicator for GCP Card Member receivables for prior periods and represents the ratio of GCP Card Member receivables write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. The net loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 0.08 %. 

Refer to Note 3 for additional indicators, including external environmental qualitative factors, management considers in its evaluation process for reserves for credit losses. 

IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES 

Impaired loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the customer agreement. We consider impaired loans and receivables to include (i) loans over 90 days past due still accruing interest, (ii) nonaccrual loans and (iii) loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). 

In instances where the customer is experiencing financial difficulty, we may modify, through various financial relief programs, loans and receivables with the intention to minimize losses and improve collectability, while providing customers with temporary or permanent financial relief. We have classified loans and receivables in these modification programs as TDRs and continue to classify customer accounts that have exited a modification program as a TDR, with such accounts identified as &#8220;Out of Program TDRs.&#8221; 

Such modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include (i) temporary interest rate reductions (possibly as low as zero percent, in which case the loan is characterized as non-accrual in our TDR disclosures), (ii) placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and (iii) suspending delinquency fees until the customer exits the modification program. Upon entering the modification program, the customer&#8217;s ability to make future purchases is either limited, canceled, or in certain cases suspended until the customer successfully exits from the modification program. In accordance with the modification agreement with the customer, loans and/or receivables may revert back to the original contractual terms (including the contractual interest rate where applicable) when the customer exits the modification program, which is (i) when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or (ii) when the customer defaults out of the modification program. 

Reserves for modifications deemed TDRs are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model. All changes in the impairment measurement are included within provisions for credit losses. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States enacted legislation that provided the option to temporarily suspend (i) certain requirements under U.S. GAAP for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise be treated as TDRs and (ii) any determination that a loan modified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is a TDR (including impairment for accounting purposes). Based on the nature of our programs, we have not elected the accounting and reporting relief afforded by this legislation and continue to report modifications as TDRs. 

In the first quarter of 2020, we created a Customer Pandemic Relief (CPR) program for customers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a concession in the form of payment deferrals and waivers of certain fees and interest. We assessed the CPR program and determined that eligible loan modifications were temporary in nature, for example, less than three months, and not considered TDRs. Our short-term CPR programs are no longer widely available with immaterial balances remaining in the program as of December 31, 2020. 

The following tables provide additional information with respect to our impaired loans and receivables as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

NOTE 3 

RESERVES FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Reserves for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&#38;S Period), which is approximately three years, beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses . 

We use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the R&#38;S Period. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month of the R&#38;S Period. Beyond the R&#38;S Period, we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. 

&#8226; PD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off. 

&#8226; EAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer. Due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios, the EAD models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors. 

&#8226; Recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from Card Members after default occurs, typically as a result of collection efforts. Future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default, time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions. 

We also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions. Our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses. 

Future economic conditions that are incorporated over the R&#38;S Period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. Management reviews these economic scenarios and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product, that are significant to our models. 

We also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. We consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves (higher or lower) to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. 

Lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity, including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics, such as past spend and remittance behaviors, credit bureau scores where available, delinquency status, tenure of balance outstanding, amongst others. Credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of Reserves for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and within the Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than reversing interest income. Separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring, which are measured individually using a discounted cash flow model. See Note 2 for information on troubled debt restructurings. 

Loans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible, which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than 180 days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and 120 days past due for term loans. Loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification. 

Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology while comparative information continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology in effect for prior years. Reserves for credit losses under the incurred loss methodology were primarily based upon statistical and analytical models that analyzed portfolio performance and reflected management&#8217;s judgments regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models considered several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. Similar to the CECL methodology, we considered whether to adjust the quantitative reserves for certain external and internal qualitative factors, which may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses. 

CHANGES IN CARD MEMBER LOANS RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Card Member loans reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook, including unemployment and GDP, partially offset by improved credit performance and a decline in outstanding balances.

NOTE 4 

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

Investment securities principally include available-for-sale debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses for all available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Comparative information continues to be reported in accordance with the methodology in effect for prior periods. When estimating a security&#8217;s probability of default and the recovery rate, we assess the security&#8217;s credit indicators, including credit ratings. If our assessment indicates that an expected credit loss exists, we determine the portion of the unrealized loss attributable to credit deterioration and record a reserve for the expected credit loss through the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other loans Provision for credit losses. Unrealized gains and any portion of a security&#8217;s unrealized loss attributable to non-credit losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, net of tax. We had accrued interest on our available-for-sale debt securities totaling $ 26 million and $ 20 million, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, presented as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Investment securities also include equity securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other, net expense. 

Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method. 

Refer to Note 14 for a description of our methodology for determining the fair value of investment securities.

NOTE 5 

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS 

We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card businesses through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts, American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust and together with the Lending Trust, the Trusts). The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. 

The Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 1 for further details on the principles of consolidation. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts&#8217; economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our ownership of variable interests was $ 13.4 billion and $ 12.9 billion, respectively, for the Lending Trust and $ 4.3 billion and $ 8.3 billion, respectively, for the Charge Trust. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts. 

The debt securities issued by the Trusts are non-recourse to us. The securitized Card Member loans and receivables held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively, are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions (refer to Note 2). The long-term debt of each Trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets (refer to Note 8). 

Restricted cash held by the Lending Trust and Charge Trust was $ 47 million and nil , respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $ 85 million and nil , respectively, as of December 31, 2019. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities. 

Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no such triggering events occurred.

Accumulated impairment losses were $ 221 million as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years. We review long-lived assets and asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the asset or asset group&#8217;s fair value. 

The gross carrying amount for other intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 759 million and $ 704 million, respectively, with accumulated amortization of $ 494 million and $ 437 million, respectively. 

Amortization expense, which is recorded within Other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was $ 54 million, $ 49 million and $ 212 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS 

We account for our tax credit investments, including Qualified Affordable Housing (QAH) investments, using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $ 1,147 million and $ 1,154 million in tax credit investments, respectively, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $ 1,095 million and $ 1,109 million, respectively, related to QAH investments. Included in QAH investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $ 1,028 million and $ 1,032 million, respectively, related to investments in unconsolidated VIEs for which we do not have a controlling financial interest. 

As of December 31, 2020, we committed to provide funding related to certain of these QAH investments, which is expected to be paid between 2021 and 2035 , resulting in $ 208 million in unfunded commitments reported in Other liabilities, of which $ 189 million specifically related to unconsolidated VIEs. 

In addition, as of December 31, 2020 we had contractual off-balance sheet obligations, which were not deemed probable of being drawn, to provide additional funding up to $ 106 million for these QAH investments, fully related to unconsolidated VIEs. 

During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recognized equity method losses related to our QAH investments of $ 128 million, $ 101 million and $ 126 million, respectively, which were recognized in Other, net expenses; and associated tax credits of $ 129 million, $ 119 million and $ 97 million, respectively, recognized in Income tax provision.

We maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $ 3.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of which was undrawn as of the respective dates. The availability of the credit line is subject to compliance with certain covenants by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco), principally the maintenance by Credco of a 1.25 ratio of its combined earnings, certain capital contributions and fixed charges, to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Credco was not in violation of any of these covenants. 

Additionally, we maintained a three-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility that gives us the right to sell up to $ 3.0 billion face amount of eligible notes issued from the Charge Trust at any time through July 15, 2022 .

(d) Primarily includes book overdraft balances, net deferred card and other fees, Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, lease liabilities, derivative and hedge liabilities, dividends payable, client incentives and restructuring and reengineering reserves. 

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS 

The Membership Rewards program allows enrolled Card Members to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad variety of rewards including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. 

The expense for Membership Rewards points is included in Card Member rewards expense. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. 

DEFERRED CARD AND OTHER FEES, NET

##TABLE_START &#160; Stock Options Service-Based RSUs Service and Performance-Based RSUs (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Grant Price Shares Weighted- Average Grant Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2019 4,172 &#160; $ 72.70 &#160; 2,412 &#160; $ 91.42 &#160; 3,392 &#160; $ 88.25 &#160; Granted 422 &#160; 131.68 &#160; 816 &#160; 127.56 &#160; 1,089 &#160; 122.15 &#160; Exercised/vested ( 822 ) 53.50 &#160; ( 1,042 ) 82.77 &#160; ( 1,193 ) 78.52 &#160; Forfeited ( 21 ) 65.43 &#160; ( 108 ) 105.32 &#160; ( 142 ) 101.38 &#160; Expired &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2020 3,751 &#160; 83.59 &#160; 2,078 &#160; $ 109.23 &#160; 3,146 &#160; $ 103.08 &#160; Options vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 3,751 &#160; 83.59 &#160; Options exercisable as of December 31, 2020 2,706 &#160; $ 72.26 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized ratably based on the grant-date fair value of the awards, net of expected forfeitures, over the vesting period. The vesting period is the shorter of the vesting schedule as defined in each award agreement or the date an individual will become eligible to retire. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and/or years of service. 

STOCK OPTIONS 

Each stock option has an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual term of 10 years from the date of grant. 

The weighted-average remaining contractual life and the aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the fair value of our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the option) of the stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020, were as follows: 

##TABLE_START Outstanding Exercisable Vested and Expected to Vest

Aggregate intrinsic value (millions) 

$ 145 &#160; $ 132 &#160; $ 145 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which will be recognized ratably over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 1.5 years. 

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for options granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Dividend yield 1.4 &#160; % 1.5 &#160; % 1.4 &#160; %

7.1 7.1 7.1 Weighted-average fair value per option $ 25.83 &#160; $ 23.38 &#160; $ 23.17 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(a) The expected volatility is based on both weighted historical and implied volatilities of our common stock price. 

(b) The expected life of stock options was determined using both historical data and expectations of option exercise behavior. 

For stock options that were exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018, the intrinsic value, based upon the fair value of our stock price at the date the options were exercised, was $ 47 million, $ 104 million and $ 104 million, respectively; cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 44 million, $ 84 million and $ 87 million during those respective periods. The income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to stock option exercises was $ 7 million, $ 18 million and $ 18 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS/AWARDS 

We grant RSUs that contain either a) service conditions or b) both service and performance conditions. RSUs containing only service conditions generally vest 25 percent per year beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. RSUs containing both service and performance conditions generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, and the number of shares earned depends on the achievement of predetermined Company metrics. All RSU holders receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents. 

Beginning in 2019, a relative total shareholder return (r-TSR) modifier was added to the performance-based RSUs, so that our actual shareholder return relative to a competitive peer group is one of the performance conditions that determines the number of shares ultimately granted upon vesting. 

The fair value of RSUs that do not include the r-TSR modifier, including those that contain only service conditions, is measured using our stock price on the grant date. The fair value of service and performance-based RSUs that include the r-TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions for December 31: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019

(a) The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock price. 

As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 204 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs, which will be recognized ratably over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2.0 years. 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 124.47 , $ 96.24 and $ 98.20 , respectively. 

For RSUs vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018, the total fair value, based upon our stock price at the date the RSUs vested, was $ 291 million, $ 286 million and $ 239 million, respectively. 

LIABILITY-BASED AWARDS 

In 2018, certain employees were awarded PGs and other incentive awards that can be settled with cash or equity shares at our discretion and final Compensation and Benefits Committee payout approval; beginning in 2019, we discontinued granting PGs. These awards earn value based on performance, market and/or service conditions, and vest over a period of three years . 

PGs and other incentive awards are generally settled with cash and thus are classified as liabilities; therefore, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and remeasured quarterly as part of compensation expense over the vesting period. Cash paid upon vesting of these awards in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 81 million, $ 81 million and $ 56 million, respectively. 

NOTE 11 

RETIREMENT PLANS 

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS 

We sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, the principal plan being the Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), a 401(k) savings plan with a profit-sharing component. The RSP is a tax-qualified retirement plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and covers most employees in the United States. The total expense for all defined contribution retirement plans globally was $ 267 million, $ 278 million and $ 272 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 

Our primary defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in the United States and United Kingdom are closed to new entrants and existing participants do not accrue any additional benefits. Most employees outside the United States and United Kingdom are covered by local retirement plans, some of which are funded, while other employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. We comply with minimum funding requirements in all countries. We also sponsor unfunded other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance to certain retired U.S. employees. For these plans, the total net benefit was $ 8 million, $ 8 million and $ 0.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unfunded status related to the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans was $ 706 million and $ 640 million, respectively, and is recorded in Other liabilities. 

NOTE 12 

CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS 

CONTINGENCIES 

In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). 

Based on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we do not believe we are a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below. 

A putative merchant class action in the Eastern District of New York, consolidated in 2011 and collectively captioned In re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation (II) , alleged that provisions in our merchant agreements prohibiting merchants from differentially surcharging our cards or steering a customer to use another network&#8217;s card or another type of general-purpose card (&#8220;anti-steering&#8221; and &#8220;non-discrimination&#8221; contractual provisions) violate U.S. antitrust laws. On January 15, 2020, our motion to compel arbitration of claims brought by merchants who accept American Express and to dismiss claims of merchants who do not was granted. Plaintiffs have appealed part of this decision. 

On February 25, 2020, we were named as a defendant in a case filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, captioned Laurelwood Cleaners LLC v. American Express Co., et al. , in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction prohibiting American Express from enforcing its anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions and from requiring merchants &#8220;to offer the service of Amex-card acceptance for free.&#8221; We intend to vigorously defend the case. 

On January 29, 2019, we were named in a putative class action brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Anthony Oliver, et al. v. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc. , in which the plaintiffs are holders of MasterCard, Visa and/or Discover credit cards (but not American Express cards) and allege they paid higher prices as a result of our anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions in violation of federal antitrust law and the antitrust and consumer laws of various states. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other forms of relief. The court dismissed plaintiffs&#8217; federal antitrust claim, numerous state antitrust and consumer protection claims and their unjust enrichment claim. The remaining claims in plaintiffs&#8217; complaint arise under the antitrust laws of 11 states and the consumer protection laws of six states. 

In July 2004, we were named as a defendant in another putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently transferred to the Eastern District of New York, captioned The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Co., et al. , in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. 

On March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B&#38;R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam&#8217;s Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a suit, captioned B&#38;R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam&#8217;s Market, et al. v. Visa Inc., et al. , for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California&#8217;s Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express Company, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was filed on July 15, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards, and on May 4, 2017, the California court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On August 28, 2020, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. 

We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions. While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. 

Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages sought, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. 

We have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. 

For those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $ 210 million in excess of any accruals related to those matters. This range represents management&#8217;s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals. In addition, it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

In addition, we face exposure associated with Card Member purchases of goods and services, including with respect to the following: 

&#8226; Return Protection &#8212; refunds the price of qualifying purchases made with eligible cards, where the merchant will not accept the return, for up to 90 days from the date of purchase; and 

&#8226; Merchant Protection &#8212; protects Card Members primarily against non-delivery of goods and services, usually in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of a merchant. When this occurs, the Card Member may dispute the transaction for which we will generally credit the Card Member&#8217;s account. If we are unable to collect the amount from the merchant, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. The largest component of the exposure relates to Card Member transactions associated with travel-related merchants, primarily through business arrangements where we have remitted payment to such merchants for a Card Member travel purchase that has not yet been used or &#8220;flown.&#8221; 

We have an accrual of $ 58 million related to these exposures as of December 31, 2020. To date, we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting containment measures. A reasonably possible loss related to these exposures in excess of the recorded accrual cannot be quantified as the Card Member purchases that may include or result in claims are not sufficiently estimable, although we believe our risk of loss has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

COMMITMENTS 

Total lease expense includes rent expenses, adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 177 million, $ 151 million and $ 142 million, respectively. 

Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. For lease liabilities outstanding as of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term was 19 years and the weighted average rate used to discount lease commitments was 3 percent. 

The following represents the maturities of our outstanding lease commitments as of December 31, 2020:

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $ 4 billion in financial commitments outstanding related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement, generally ranging from five to ten years. Such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payment we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on Card Members&#8217; spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new Card Members. In the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment, we generally pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points. As of December 31, 2020, we also had certain cobrand arrangements that include commitments based on variables, the values of which are not yet determinable and thus the amount is not quantifiable. 

NOTE 13 

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes. 

Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include: 

&#8226; Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and 

&#8226; Foreign exchange risk related to earnings, funding, transactions and investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 

We centrally monitor market risks using market risk limits and escalation triggers as defined in our Asset/Liability Management Policy. Our market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services. 

Interest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings, as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime, LIBOR and the overnight indexed swap rate. Interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to economically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate obligations, or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations. We may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors. 

Foreign exchange risk is generated by Card Member cross-currency spend, foreign currency balance sheet exposures, foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in entities outside the United States. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure, to the extent it is economical, through various means, including the use of derivatives such as foreign exchange forwards. 

Derivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to, an uncollateralized derivative exposure. We manage this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential future exposure of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved by us and rated as investment grade, and counterparty risk exposures are centrally monitored. 

A majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. Accordingly, where appropriate, we have elected to present derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To further mitigate counterparty credit risk, we exercise our rights under executed credit support agreements with the respective derivative counterparties for our bilateral interest rate swaps and select foreign exchange contracts. These agreements require that, in the event the fair value change in the net derivatives position between the two parties exceeds certain dollar thresholds, the party in the net liability position posts collateral to its counterparty. All derivative contracts cleared through a central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contracts. 

In relation to our credit risk, certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position. As of December 31, 2020, these derivatives were not in a material net liability position and we had no material risk exposure to any individual derivative counterparty. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required. 

Our derivatives are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in fair value depends on the instruments&#8217; intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below. Refer to Note 14 for a description of our methodology for determining the fair value of derivatives. 

The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31:

(a) For our centrally cleared derivatives, variation margin payments are legally characterized as settlement payments as opposed to collateral. 

(b) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. 

(c) Represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contracts and certain foreign exchange contracts with the right to cash collateral held from the counterparty or cash collateral posted with the counterparty. 

(d) We posted $ 34 million and $ 47 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances. 

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING 

Derivatives executed for hedge accounting purposes are documented and designated as such when we enter into the contracts. In accordance with our risk management policies, we structure our hedges with terms similar to those of the item being hedged. We formally assess, at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. These assessments usually are made through the application of a regression analysis method. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, we will discontinue the application of hedge accounting. 

FAIR VALUE HEDGES 

A fair value hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge our exposure to future changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an identified portion thereof, that is attributable to a particular risk. 

Interest Rate Contracts 

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate long-term debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We have $ 15.8 billion and $ 22.6 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Gains or losses on the fair value hedging instrument principally offset the losses or gains on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The changes in the fair value of the derivative and the changes in the hedged item may not fully offset due to differences between a debt obligation&#8217;s interest rate and the benchmark rate, primarily due to credit spreads at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap. Furthermore, the difference may be caused by changes in 1-month LIBOR, 3-month LIBOR and the overnight indexed swap rate, as spreads between these rates impact the fair value of the interest rate swap without an exact offsetting impact to the fair value of the hedged debt. 

The following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the years ended December 31: 

##TABLE_START Gains (losses) (Millions) 2020 2019 2018 Fixed-rate long-term debt $ ( 405 ) $ ( 458 ) $ 59 &#160; Derivatives designated as hedging instruments 409 &#160; 462 &#160; ( 43 ) Total $ 4 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 16 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $ 16.4 billion and $ 22.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments of $ 622 million and $ 217 million for the respective periods. 

We recognized a net decrease of $ 256 million and net increases of $ 102 million and $ 51 million in Interest expense on Long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements including interest accruals on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges. 

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES 

A net investment hedge is used to hedge future changes in currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. We primarily designate foreign currency derivatives, typically foreign exchange forwards, and on occasion foreign currency denominated debt, as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. These instruments reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We had notional amounts of approximately $ 10.5 billion and $ 9.8 billion of foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, were losses of $ 252 million and $ 140 million and a gain of $ 328 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net investment hedge reclassifications out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the sale or liquidation of a business, net of taxes, were $ 1 million, nil and $ 1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES 

We have derivatives that act as economic hedges, but are not designated as such for hedge accounting purposes. Foreign currency transactions from time to time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards. These hedges generally mature within one year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of designated currencies at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date. 

We also have certain operating agreements containing payments that may be linked to a market rate or price, primarily foreign currency rates. The payment components of these agreements may meet the definition of an embedded derivative, in which case the embedded derivative is accounted for separately and is classified as a foreign exchange contract based on its primary risk exposure. 

The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in net gains of $ 10 million, $ 64 million and $ 60 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, that are recognized in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in the net gain of $ 64 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, is a gain of $ 3 million, related to a change in the fair value of an embedded derivative. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivative for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted in a loss of $ 11 million that is recognized in Card Member services expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

NOTE 14 

FAIR VALUES 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be required to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. 

GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8213; Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8213; Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including: 

&#8211; Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 

&#8211; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; 

&#8211; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and 

&#8211; Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8213; Inputs that are unobservable and reflect our own estimates about the estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). We did not measure any financial instruments presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, although the disclosed fair value of certain assets that are not carried at fair value, as presented later in this Note, are classified within Level 3. 

We monitor the market conditions and evaluate the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no Level 3 transfers.

VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE 

For the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table above), we apply the following valuation techniques: 

Investment Securities 

When available, quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are used to estimate fair value. Such investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

When quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are not available, the fair values for our investment securities are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by us, and we receive one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. Such investment securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. 

We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services by comparing them to alternative pricing sources. In instances where price discrepancies are identified between different pricing sources, we evaluate such discrepancies to ensure that the prices used for our valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment securities. Refer to Note 4 for additional fair value information. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The fair value of our derivative financial instruments is estimated internally by using third-party pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from active markets. The pricing models used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives as described below. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques at least annually and validate the valuation output on a quarterly basis. Our derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the swap such as the notional amount, fixed coupon rate, floating coupon rate and tenor, as well as discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. 

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the forward contracts such as the notional amount, maturity dates and contract rate, as well as relevant foreign currency forward curves, and discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. 

Credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters, such as a benchmark curve, used to value derivatives are not indicative of our credit quality or that of our counterparties. We consider the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure. Refer to Note 13 for additional fair value information. 

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at amortized cost, and not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon the market conditions and perceived risks as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and require management&#8217;s judgment. These figures may not be indicative of future fair values, nor can the fair value of American Express be estimated by aggregating the amounts presented.

VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE 

For the financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table), we apply the following valuation techniques to measure fair value: 

Financial Assets For Which Carrying Values Equal Or Approximate Fair Value 

Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include cash and cash equivalents, Card Member receivables, accrued interest and certain other assets. For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate. 

Financial Assets Carried At Other Than Fair Value 

Card Member and Other loans, less reserves 

Card Member and Other loans are recorded at historical cost, less reserves, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair value for our loans, we use a discounted cash flow model. Due to the lack of a comparable whole loan sales market for similar loans and the lack of observable pricing inputs thereof, we use various inputs to estimate fair value. Such inputs include projected income, discount rates and forecasted write-offs. The valuation does not include economic value attributable to future receivables generated by the accounts associated with the loans. 

Financial Liabilities For Which Carrying Values Equal Or Approximate Fair Value 

Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include accrued interest, customer deposits (excluding certificates of deposit, which are described further below), Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products outstanding, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities for which the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate. 

Financial Liabilities Carried At Other Than Fair Value 

Certificates of Deposit 

Certificates of deposit (CDs) are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the current market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets. 

Long-term Debt 

Long-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized discount and unamortized fees, (ii) the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and (iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes that have been swapped to floating rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads, bond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. 

NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

We have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did no t have any material assets that were measured at fair value due to impairment and there were no material fair value adjustments for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. 

NOTE 15 

GUARANTEES 

The maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability resulting from guarantees and indemnifications provided by us in the ordinary course of business were $ 1 billion and $ 24 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, and $ 1 billion and $ 29 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, all of which were primarily related to our real estate and business dispositions. 

To date, we have not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. Our recognition of these instruments is at fair value. In addition, we establish reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

COMMON AND PREFERRED SHARES 

The following table shows authorized shares and provides a reconciliation of common shares issued and outstanding for the years ended December 31:

(a) Of the common shares authorized but unissued as of December 31, 2020, approximately 23 million shares are reserved for issuance under employee stock and employee benefit plans. 

On September 23, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million common shares from time to time, subject to market conditions and in accordance with our capital plans. This authorization replaced the prior repurchase authorization and does not have an expiration date. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 7 million common shares with a cost basis of $ 0.9 billion, 40 million common shares with a cost basis of $ 4.6 billion, and 15 million common shares with a cost basis of $ 1.6 billion, respectively. The cost basis includes commissions paid of $ 1.0 million, $ 6.2 million and $ 2.2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 102 million common shares remaining under the Board share repurchase authorization. 

Common shares are generally retired by us upon repurchase (except for 2.5 million, 2.6 million and 2.7 million shares held as treasury shares as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively); retired common shares and treasury shares are excluded from the shares outstanding in the table above. The treasury shares, with a cost basis of $ 279 million, $ 292 million and $ 207 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital in Shareholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

PREFERRED SHARES 

The Board of Directors is authorized to permit us to issue up to 20 million Preferred Shares at a par value of $1.66 2/3 without further shareholder approval. We have the following perpetual Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Share series issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020:

In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over our common stock for the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets out of funds legally available for distribution to shareholders. Each outstanding series of Preferred Shares has a liquidation price of $ 1 million per Preferred Share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. We may redeem these Preferred Shares at $ 1 million per Preferred Share (equivalent to $ 1,000 per depositary share) plus any declared but unpaid dividends in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after the respective fixed to floating rate conversion date, or in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of certain bank regulatory changes. 

There were no warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

##TABLE_START (Millions) 2020 2019 2018 Current income tax expense: U.S. federal $ 1,122 &#160; $ 1,108 &#160; $ 70 &#160; U.S. state and local 339 &#160; 276 &#160; 150 &#160; Non-U.S. 639 &#160; 437 &#160; 681 &#160; Total current income tax expense 2,100 &#160; 1,821 &#160; 901 &#160; Deferred income tax (benefit) expense: U.S. federal ( 931 ) ( 58 ) 276 &#160; U.S. state and local ( 119 ) ( 31 ) 78 &#160; Non-U.S. 111 &#160; ( 62 ) ( 54 ) Total deferred income tax (benefit) expense ( 939 ) ( 151 ) 300 &#160; Total income tax expense $ 1,161 &#160; $ 1,670 &#160; $ 1,201 &#160; ##TABLE_END

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 percent as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, to our actual income tax rate was as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#160; 2020 2019 2018 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % (Decrease) increase in taxes resulting from: Tax-exempt income ( 4.1 ) ( 1.9 ) ( 1.7 ) State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.7 &#160; 2.8 &#160; 2.8 &#160; Non-U.S. subsidiaries' earnings

(a) 2018 primarily included a settlement of the IRS examination for tax years 2008 - 2014 , as well as the resolution of certain tax matters in various jurisdictions. 

(b) 2018 included changes to the tax method of accounting for certain expenses and adjustments to the 2017 provisional Tax Act charge. 

We record a deferred income tax (benefit) provision when there are differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and for income tax return purposes. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. 

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are reflected in the following table: 

##TABLE_START (Millions) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Reserves not yet deducted for tax purposes $ 3,905 &#160; $ 2,633 &#160; Employee compensation and benefits 383 &#160; 365 &#160; Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 399 &#160; 119 &#160; Other 765 &#160; 417 &#160; Gross deferred tax assets 5,452 &#160; 3,534 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 418 ) ( 66 ) Deferred tax assets after valuation allowance 5,034 &#160; 3,468 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Intangibles and fixed assets 1,433 &#160; 1,279 &#160; Deferred revenue 252 &#160; 315 &#160; Deferred interest 148 &#160; 162 &#160; Investment in joint ventures 135 &#160; 122 &#160; Other 366 &#160; 129 &#160; Gross deferred tax liabilities 2,334 &#160; 2,007 &#160; Net deferred tax assets $ 2,700 &#160; $ 1,461 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The net operating loss and tax credit carryforward balance as of December 31, 2020, shown in the table above, is related to pre-tax U.S. federal and non-U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $ 140 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, and foreign tax credit (FTC) carryforwards of $ 100 million. If not utilized, certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2021 and 2037, whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030. 

A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances for both periods presented above are associated with certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, the valuation allowances as of December 31, 2020 are also associated with FTC carryforwards. 

Accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which totaled approximately $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. We do not provide for state income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Accordingly, state income and foreign withholding taxes, which would have aggregated to approximately $ 0.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, have not been provided on those earnings. 

Net income taxes paid by us during 2020, 2019 and 2018, were approximately $ 2.2 billion, $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.0 billion, respectively. These amounts include estimated tax payments and cash settlements relating to prior tax years. 

We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer&#8217;s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent complexities, we must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on management&#8217;s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on management&#8217;s best judgment of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement with the taxing authority given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We adjust the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome. 

We are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. 

The following table presents changes in unrecognized tax benefits: 

##TABLE_START (Millions) 2020 2019 2018 Balance, January 1 $ 726 &#160; $ 701 &#160; $ 821 &#160; Increases: Current year tax positions 57 &#160; 66 &#160; 152 &#160; Tax positions related to prior years 105 &#160; 78 &#160; 47 &#160; Effects of foreign currency translations &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Decreases: Tax positions related to prior years

(a) 2018 included a settlement of the IRS examination for tax years 2008 - 2014 and the resolution of certain tax matters in various jurisdictions. 

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $ 0.8 billion, $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.7 billion for December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are approximately $ 580 million, $ 623 million and $ 599 million, respectively, that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in a future period. 

We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $ 130 million, principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years&#8217; tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years&#8217; tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $ 130 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $ 110 million relates to amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in a future period. 

Interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in the income tax provision. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized approximately $ 260 million and $ 5 million, respectively, in expenses for interest and penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized benefits of approximately $ 18 million, for interest and penalties. 

We had approximately $ 350 million and $ 70 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(a) Our unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the denominator. 

(b) The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes from the computation of EPS 0.5 million, 0.2 million and 0.7 million of options for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 22 

REGULATORY MATTERS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY 

We are supervised and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) and are subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s requirements for risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), is subject to supervision and regulation, including regulatory capital and leverage requirements, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). 

Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets). 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators, that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our operating activities. 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we met all capital requirements to which we were subject and maintained regulatory capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as well capitalized. 

The following table presents the regulatory capital ratios:

(c) Represents Basel III minimum capital requirement and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for American Express National Bank. 

(d) As defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and OCC. 

RESTRICTED NET ASSETS OF SUBSIDIARIES 

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the transfer of net assets under debt agreements and regulatory requirements. These restrictions have not had any effect on our shareholder dividend policy and management does not anticipate any impact in the future. Procedures exist to transfer net assets between the Company and its subsidiaries, while ensuring compliance with the various contractual and regulatory constraints. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of net assets of subsidiaries that are restricted to be transferred was approximately $ 7.7 billion. 

BANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends by the Federal Reserve, which could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends over a two-year horizon. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan. 

BANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 

In the year ended December 31, 2020, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $ 4.5 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. As of December 31, 2020, AENB's retained earnings available for the payment of dividends was $ 6.9 billion. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. 

NOTE 23 

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS 

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to American Express&#8217; total credit exposure. Our customers operate in diverse industries, economic sectors and geographic regions. 

The following table details our maximum credit exposure of the on-balance sheet assets by category as of December 31:

(b) Represents banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and savings and loan associations. 

(c) Represent debt obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies, states and municipalities and government-sponsored entities. 

(d) Primarily reflects loans and receivables from global corporate Card Members, which are governed by institutional credit risk management. 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our most significant concentration of credit risk was with individuals, including Card Member loans and receivables. These amounts are generally advanced on an unsecured basis. However, we review each potential customer&#8217;s credit application and evaluate the applicant&#8217;s financial history and ability and willingness to repay. We also consider credit performance by customer tenure, industry and geographic location in managing credit exposure. 

The following table details our Card Member loans and receivables exposure (including unused lines-of-credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements) in the United States and outside the United States as of December 31: 

##TABLE_START (Billions) 2020 2019 On-balance sheet: U.S. $ 95 &#160; $ 115 &#160; Non-U.S. 22 &#160; 30 &#160; On-balance sheet 117 &#160; 145 &#160;

(a) Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. 

NOTE 24 

REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS 

REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS 

We consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States), and regulatory environment considerations. 

The following is a brief description of the primary business activities of our three reportable operating segments: 

&#8226; Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG) primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel and lifestyle services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China. 

&#8226; Global Commercial Services (GCS) primarily issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards. In addition, GCS provides payment, expense management, and commercial financing products. 

&#8226; Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS) operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses. 

Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &#38; Other. 

Effective for the first quarter of 2020, we made certain enhancements to our transfer pricing methodology related to the sharing of revenues between our card issuing, network and merchant businesses, and our methodology related to the allocation of certain funding costs primarily related to our Card Member loan and Card Member receivable portfolios. These enhancements resulted in certain changes to Non-interest revenues, Interest expense and operating expenses across our reportable operating segments and geographic regions. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. These changes had no impact on our Consolidated Results of Operations. 

The following table presents certain selected financial information for our reportable operating segments and Corporate &#38; Other as of or for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

(a) Corporate &#38; Other includes adjustments and eliminations for intersegment activity. 

(b) Includes discount revenue, certain other fees and commissions and other revenues from customers. 

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 

We allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the GCSG and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment&#8217;s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. 

Net card fees and other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. 

Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. 

Provisions for Credit Losses 

The provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. 

Expenses 

Marketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables. 

Income Taxes
