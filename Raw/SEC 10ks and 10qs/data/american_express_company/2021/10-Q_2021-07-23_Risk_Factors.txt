 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

For a discussion of our risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the 2020 Form 10-K). The risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those set forth in the 2020 Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities, particularly in light of the fast-changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, containment and stimulus measures, continued outbreaks, and the related impacts to economic and operating conditions.
