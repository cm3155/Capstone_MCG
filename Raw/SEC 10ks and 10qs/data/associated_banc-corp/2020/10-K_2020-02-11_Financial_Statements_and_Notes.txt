(a) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a change in accounting policy to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. The change had no impact on either earnings or equity. The Corporation believes that this change is a preferable method of accounting as it provides a better reflection of the assets and liabilities on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of this change was voluntary and has been adopted retrospectively with all prior periods presented herein revised.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 

Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to U.S. GAAP and to general practice within the financial services industry. The following is a description of the more significant of those policies. 

Business 

Associated Banc-Corp is a bank holding company headquartered in Wisconsin. The Corporation provides a full range of banking and related financial services to consumer and commercial customers through its network of bank and nonbank subsidiaries. The Corporation is subject to competition from other financial and non-financial institutions that offer similar or competing products and services. The Corporation is regulated by federal and state agencies and is subject to periodic examinations by those agencies. 

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated entities (none of which are considered to be variable interest entities in which the Corporation is the primary beneficiary) are accounted for using the cost method of accounting when the Corporation has determined that the cost method is appropriate. Investments not meeting the criteria for cost method accounting are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in unconsolidated entities are included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, and the Corporation&#8217;s share of income or loss is recorded in other noninterest income, while distributions in excess of the investment are asset gains (losses), net. 

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, goodwill impairment assessment, MSRs valuation, and income taxes. Management has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 

Business Combinations 

The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase accounting method. Purchase accounting requires the total purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain intangible assets that must be recognized. Typically, this allocation results in the purchase price exceeding the fair value of net assets acquired, which is recorded as goodwill. Core deposit intangibles are a measure of the value of checking, money market and savings deposits acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. Core deposit intangibles and other identified intangibles with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years. 

Loans that the Corporation acquires in connection with acquisitions are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows. If a reasonable expectation on the amount or timing of such cash flows can't be determined, accretion of the fair value discount for nonperforming loans will be recognized using the cost recovery method of accounting. 

For purchased credit-impaired loans, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable discount. The non-accretable discount includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will require the Corporation to evaluate the need for an additional allowance for credit losses. Subsequent improvement in expected cash flows will result in the reversal of a corresponding amount of the non-accretable discount which the Corporation will then reclassify as accretable discount that will be recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan. 

The Corporation accounts for performing loans acquired in business combinations using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans&#8217; contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including credit, interest, and liquidity discounts. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. There is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date for purchased performing loans. A provision for loan losses is recorded for any further deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information on the Corporation's acquisitions. 

Investment Securities 

Securities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or equity on the consolidated balance sheets at the time of purchase. Investment securities classified as held to maturity, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available for sale, which management has the intent and ability to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in stockholders&#8217; equity as a separate component of OCI. Investment securities classified as equity securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value immediately reflected in the consolidated statements of income. Any decision to sell investment securities available for sale would be based on various factors, including, but not limited to, asset / liability management strategies, changes in interest rates or prepayment risks, liquidity needs, or regulatory capital considerations. Realized gains or losses on investment security sales (using specific identification method) are included in investment securities gains (losses), net, on the consolidated statements of income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the estimated life (earlier of call date, maturity, or estimated life) of the related security, using a prospective method that approximates level yield. 

In certain situations, management may elect to transfer certain investment securities from the available for sale classification to the held to maturity classification. In such cases, the investment securities are reclassified at fair value at the time of transfer. Any unrealized gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of transfer is retained therein and amortized over the remaining life of the investment security as an adjustment to yield. 

Declines in the fair value of investment securities (with certain exceptions for debt securities noted below) that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are charged to earnings as a realized loss, and a new cost basis for the investment security is established. In evaluating other-than-temporary impairment, management considers the length of time and extent to which the security has been in an unrealized loss position, changes in security ratings, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as security and industry specific economic conditions. In addition, the Corporation considers the intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below amortized cost are deemed to be other-than-temporary in circumstances where: (1) the Corporation has the intent to sell a security; (2) it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the Corporation does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Corporation intends to sell a security or if it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the security before recovery, an other-than-temporary impairment write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and an amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in OCI. Declines in value determined to be other-than-temporary are included in investment securities gains (losses), net, on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 3 for additional information on investment securities. 

FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank Stocks 

The Corporation is required to maintain Federal Reserve stock and FHLB stock as a member of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, and in amounts as required by these institutions. These equity securities are &#8220;restricted&#8221; in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other marketable equity securities and their fair value is equal to amortized cost. See Note 3 for additional information on the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank Stocks. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Residential Loans Held for Sale: Loans held for sale, which consist generally of current production of certain fixed-rate, first-lien residential mortgage loans, are carried at estimated fair value. As a result of holding these loans at fair value, changes in the secondary market is reflected in earnings immediately, as opposed to being dependent upon the timing of sales. The estimated fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. 

Commercial Loans Held for Sale: Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. 

Loans 

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at their outstanding principal balances, net of any deferred fees and costs on originated loans. Origination fee income received on loans and amounts representing the estimated direct costs of origination are deferred and amortized to interest income over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. An allowance for loan losses is established for estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. See Allowance for Loan Losses below for further policy discussion. See also Note 4 for additional information on loans. 

Nonaccrual Loans: Management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement, including both principal and interest. This determination is based on management's review of current information and other events regarding the borrowers&#8217; ability to repay their obligations. Management has determined that commercial and consumer loan relationships that have nonaccrual status or have had their terms restructured in a troubled debt restructuring meet this impaired loan definition. 

Interest income on loans is based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method. The accrual of interest income for commercial loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrower&#8217;s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, while the accrual of interest income for consumer loans is discontinued when loans reach specific delinquency levels. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, it is management&#8217;s practice to place such loans on a nonaccrual status immediately, rather than delaying such action until the loans become 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed, amortization of related deferred loan fees or costs is suspended, and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal and interest of the loan is collectible. If collectability of the principal and interest is in doubt, payments received are applied to loan principal. 

While a loan is in nonaccrual status, some or all of the cash interest payments received may be treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining recorded investment in the loan (i.e., after charge off of identified losses, if any) is deemed to be fully collectible. The determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan's remaining recorded investment must be supported by a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower&#8217;s sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors. A nonaccrual loan is returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, the borrower has demonstrated a period of sustained repayment performance, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. A sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months. See Note 4 for additional information on loans. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;Restructured Loans&#8221;): Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. The concessions granted generally involve the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate, which generally would not otherwise be considered. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Nonaccrual restructured loans are included and treated with all other nonaccrual loans. In addition, all accruing restructured loans are reported as troubled debt restructurings, which are considered and accounted for as impaired loans. Generally, restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until the customer has attained a sustained period of repayment performance under the modified loan terms (generally a minimum of six months). However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and whether the loan should be returned to or maintained on accrual status. If the borrower&#8217;s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan remains on nonaccrual status. See Note 4 for additional information on restructured loans. 

Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and is based on quarterly evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management&#8217;s judgment, is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. 

The methodology applied by the Corporation, designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, is based upon management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio into criticized loan categories (defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation, or a criticized status of special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss). The methodology also focuses on evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. 

When an individual loan is determined to be impaired, the allowance for loan losses attributable to the loan is allocated based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flows, as well as evaluation of legal options available to the Corporation. The amount of impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the fair value of the underlying collateral less applicable selling costs, or the observable market price of the loan. If foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, impairment is measured using the fair value of the loan&#8217;s collateral, less costs to sell. Large groups of homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, and other consumer, are collectively evaluated for impairment. 

Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate. While management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on newly received appraisals, updated commercial customer financial statements, rapidly deteriorating cash flow, and changes in economic conditions that affect our customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance for loan losses or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See Loans above for further policy discussion and see Note 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses. 

OREO 

OREO is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is comprised of property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and loans classified as in-substance foreclosure. OREO is recorded at the fair value of the underlying property collateral, less estimated selling costs. This fair value becomes the new cost basis for the foreclosed asset. The initial write-down, if any, will be recorded as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair value, as well as gains and losses on disposition and revenues and expenses incurred in maintaining such properties, are expensed as incurred. OREO also includes bank premises formerly but no longer used for banking as well as property originally acquired for future expansion but no longer intended to be used for that purpose. Banking premises are transferred at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less estimated selling costs and any write-down is expensed as incurred. 

Allowance for Unfunded Commitments 

The allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for unfunded commitments is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience and credit risk grading of the loan. Net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 and Note 16 for additional information on the allowance for unfunded commitments. 

Premises and Equipment and Software 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while additions or major improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms, including extension options which the Corporation has determined are reasonably certain to be exercised, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Software, included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, is amortized on a 

straight-line basis over the lesser of the contract terms or the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 6 for additional information on premises and equipment. 

Leases 

The Corporation determines if a lease is present at the inception of an agreement. Operating leases are capitalized at commencement and are discounted using the Corporation&#8217;s FHLB borrowing rate for a similar term borrowing unless the lease defines an implicit rate within the contract. Leases with original terms of less than 12 months are not capitalized. For operating leases existing prior to January 1, 2019, the rate for the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019 was used. 

Right-of-use assets represent the Corporation&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized on the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. No significant judgments or assumptions were involved in developing the estimated operating lease liabilities as the Corporation&#8217;s operating lease liabilities largely represent future rental expenses associated with operating leases and the borrowing rates are based on publicly available interest rates. 

The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease. These options to extend or terminate are assessed on a lease-by-lease basis and adjustments are made to the right-of-use asset and lease liability if the Corporation is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised and will be expensed on a straight-line basis. Operating and finance leases are included within premises and equipment, net and other assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 for additional information on leases. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired consists primarily of goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other identifiable intangibles (primarily related to customer relationships acquired). Core deposit intangibles have estimated finite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis to expense over a 10 -year period. The other intangibles have estimated finite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge would be recorded. 

Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit. An initial qualitative evaluation is made to assess the likelihood of impairment and determine whether further quantitative testing to calculate the fair value is necessary. When the qualitative evaluation indicates that impairment is more likely than not, quantitative testing is required whereby the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to the recorded book value, &#8220;step one.&#8221; If the calculated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and &#8220;step two&#8221; is not considered necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value, the impairment test continues (&#8220;step two&#8221;) by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill. The adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. See Note 5 for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights: The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically retains the right to service the loans sold. Upon sale, an MSRs asset is capitalized, which represents the then current fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. MSRs, when purchased, are initially recorded at fair value. As the Corporation has not elected to subsequently measure any class of servicing assets under the fair value measurement method, the Corporation follows the amortization method. MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income, and assessed for impairment at each reporting date. MSRs are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value, and included in other intangible assets, net, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Corporation periodically evaluates its MSRs asset for impairment. Impairment is assessed based on fair value at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans (predominantly loan type and note interest rate). As mortgage interest rates fall, prepayment speeds are usually faster and the value of the MSRs asset generally decreases, requiring additional valuation 

reserve. Conversely, as mortgage interest rates rise, prepayment speeds are usually slower and the value of the MSRs asset generally increases, requiring less valuation reserve. A valuation allowance is established, through a charge to earnings, to the extent the amortized cost of the MSRs exceeds the estimated fair value by stratification. If it is later determined that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a stratification, the valuation is reduced through a recovery to earnings. An other-than-temporary impairment (i.e., recoverability is considered remote when considering interest rates and loan pay off activity) is recognized as a write-down of the MSRs asset and the related valuation allowance (to the extent a valuation allowance is available) and then against earnings. A direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSRs asset and valuation allowance, precluding subsequent recoveries. See Note 5 for additional information on MSRs. 

Income Taxes 

Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In assessing the realizability of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies which will create taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the amount of taxes paid in available carryback years, projected future taxable income, and, if necessary, tax planning strategies in making this assessment. 

The Corporation files a consolidated federal income tax return and separate or combined state income tax returns. Accordingly, amounts equal to tax benefits of those subsidiaries having taxable federal or state losses or credits are offset by other subsidiaries that incur federal or state tax liabilities. 

It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to provide for uncertainty in income taxes as a part of income tax expense based upon management&#8217;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the Corporation prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit was established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability established, the Corporation&#8217;s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. See Note 13 for additional information on income taxes. 

Derivative and Hedging Activities 

Derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value recorded to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income, as appropriate. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Corporation designates the derivative as a fair value hedge (i.e., a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability), a cash flow hedge (i.e., a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability), or a free-standing derivative instrument. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability are recognized in current period earnings as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the hedged item on the balance sheet and in the related income statement account. Amounts within accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. For a derivative designated as a free-standing derivative instrument, changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings. The free-standing derivative instruments included: interest rate risk management, commodity hedging, and foreign currency exchange solutions. 

The Corporation is exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The Corporation uses master netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in derivative transactions. To the extent the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements, the Corporation takes into account the impact of master netting arrangements that allow the Corporation to settle all derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. In the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation elected to offset derivative transactions with the same counterparty on the consolidated balance sheets when a derivative transaction has a legally enforceable master netting arrangement and when it is eligible for netting. Derivative balances and related cash collateral are presented net on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Change in Accounting Policy section within this note for additional discussion. 

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase 

The Corporation enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Corporation may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Corporation to repurchase the assets. These repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Corporation be in default (e.g., fails to make an interest payment to the counterparty)) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities (i.e., there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities). The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability within federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. See Notes 9 and 15 for additional information on repurchase agreements. 

Retirement Plans 

The funded status of the retirement plans is recognized as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in that funded status are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through OCI. Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of fiscal year end. The measurement of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense involve actuarial valuation methods and the use of various actuarial and economic assumptions. The Corporation monitors the assumptions and updates them periodically. Due to the long-term nature of the pension plan obligation, actual results may differ significantly from estimations. Such differences are adjusted over time as the assumptions are replaced by facts and values are recalculated. See Note 12 for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s retirement plans. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, while the fair value of restricted common stock awards is their fair market value on the date of grant. Performance awards are based on performance goals of earnings per share and total shareholder return with vesting ranging from a minimum of 0 % to a maximum of 150 % of the target award. Performance awards are valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of the awards at the grant date. The fair values of stock options and restricted stock awards are amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. Expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards are fully recognized on the date the colleague meets the definition of normal or early retirement. Compensation expense recognized is included in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 11 for additional information on stock-based compensation. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders&#8217; equity during a period, except those resulting from transactions with stockholders. In addition to net income, other components of the Corporation&#8217;s comprehensive income include the after tax effect of changes in net unrealized gain / loss on securities available for sale and changes in net actuarial gain / loss on defined benefit postretirement plans. Comprehensive income is reported on the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholder&#8217;s equity and consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See Note 22 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value represents the estimated price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price concept). As there is no active market for many of the Corporation&#8217;s financial instruments, estimates are made using discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques. Inputs into the valuation methods are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, the derived fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Corporation could realize in a current market exchange. Assets and liabilities are categorized into three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Corporation&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. See Note 18 for additional information on fair value measurements. Below is a brief description of each fair value level. 

Level 1 &#8212; Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access. 

Level 2 &#8212; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 

Level 3 &#8212; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity&#8217;s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are considered to include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Earnings per common share are calculated utilizing the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock awards (outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock awards) and common stock warrants. See Note 20 for additional information on earnings per common share. 

Change in Accounting Policy 

The Corporation enters into ISDA master netting agreements with a portion of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities and offset cash with the same counterparty. Under ASC 815-10-45-5, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty can be offset against derivative fair values under a master netting arrangement. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral. Prior to the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation elected to account for all derivatives&#8217; fair values and related cash collateral on a gross basis on its consolidated balance sheets. In the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation elected to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. The change had no impact on either earnings or equity. The Corporation believes that this change is a preferable method of accounting as it provides a better reflection of the assets and liabilities on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of this change is voluntary and has been adopted retrospectively with all prior periods presented herein being revised for comparability and as required. A reduction of $ 33 million was reflected between other assets as well as accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2018 on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Change in Accounting Estimate 

During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation reassessed its estimate of the useful lives of certain fixed assets. The Corporation revised its original useful life estimate from 7 years to 12 years for furniture assets. This is considered a change in accounting estimate, per ASC 250-10, where adjustments should be made prospectively. The impact of this change in accounting estimate for the year ended December 31, 2019 to net income on the consolidated statements of income and premises and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets was approximately $ 915,000 . 

Recently Issued Authoritative Accounting Guidance 

##TABLE_START Standard Description Date of adoption Effect on financial statements ASU 2019-07 Codification Updates to SEC Sections-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Final Releases No. 33-10532, Disclosure Updates and Simplification, and Nos. 33-10231 and 33-10442, Investment Company Reporting Modernization, and Miscellaneous Updates The FASB issued this amendment to align the guidance in various SEC sections of the Codification with the requirements of certain SEC final rules. This amendment became effective upon issuance. 3rd Quarter 2019 No material impact on results of operations, financial position and liquidity. ASU 2019-04 Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments The FASB issued this amendment to clarify certain aspects of accounting for credit losses, hedging activities, and financial instruments. Within ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, the amendment allows an entity to designate partial-term fair value hedges of interest rate risk and measure the hedged item by using an assumed maturity, clarifies that an entity can start to amortize the hedged items basis adjustment in a fair value hedge, and it requires entities to disclose for fair value hedging relationships the carrying amounts of hedged assets and liabilities and the cumulative amount of fair value hedge basis adjustments. In addition, it permits a one-time election to reclassify securities that could be used in a hedge from held to maturity to available for sale without risk of tainting the remainder of the held to maturity portfolio. For entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2017-12 as of the issuance date of this Update, the effective date is as of the beginning of the first annual period beginning after the issuance date of this Update. For those entities, early adoption was permitted, including adoption on any date on or after the issuance of this Update. 3rd Quarter 2019 During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a one-time election to transfer municipal securities with an amortized cost of $692 million from held to maturity to available for sale. ASU-2018-15 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract The FASB issued an amendment which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The amendments in this Update require an entity (customer) in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The amendments also require the entity (customer) to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities were required to apply the amendment either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. Early adoption was permitted. 1st Quarter 2019 The Corporation elected to early adopt this amendment using the prospective approach. No material impact on results of operation, financial position or liquidity. ASU 2018-09 Codification Improvements The FASB issued an amendment which affects a wide variety of Topics in the Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. The amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the Codification. The amendments make the Codification easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some of the amendments in this Update did not require transition guidance and were effective upon issuance of this Update. However, many of the amendments in this Update did have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. There are some conforming amendments in this Update that have been made to recently issued guidance that is not yet effective that may require application of the transition and effective date guidance in the original ASU. 1st Quarter 2019 No material impact on results of operations, financial position and liquidity. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START Standard Description Date of adoption Effect on financial statements ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) The FASB issued an amendment to provide transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This amendment required lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This amendment was effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities could elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. Early adoption was permitted. ASU 2018-01 permits an entity to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 land easements that exist or expired before the entity's adoption of Topic 842. ASU 2018-10 was issued as improvements and clarifications of ASU 2016-02 were identified. This Update provides clarification on narrow aspects of the previously issued Updates. ASU 2018-11 was issued to provide entities with an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new leases standard under ASU 2016-02. ASU 2019-01 was issued to assist in determining the fair value of underlying assets by lessors, address the presentation to the statements of cash flows, and clarify transition disclosures related to Topic 250. 1st Quarter 2019 The Corporation has adopted this amendment utilizing a modified retrospective approach. At adoption, a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability were recognized on the consolidated balance sheets for $52 million and $56 million, respectively. See Note 7 for expanded disclosure requirements. ##TABLE_END

Future Accounting Pronouncements 

The expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted are discussed in the table below. To the extent that the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of this financial review. 

##TABLE_START Standard Description Date of anticipated adoption Effect on financial statements ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments The FASB issued an amendment to replace the current incurred loss impairment methodology. Under the new guidance, entities will be required to measure expected credit losses by utilizing forward-looking information to assess an entity's allowance for credit losses. The guidance also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. ASU 2018-19 was issued to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2019-04 was issued and provides entities alternatives for measurement of accrued interest receivable, clarifies the steps entities should take when recording the transfer of loans or debt securities between measurement classifications or categories and clarifies that entities should include expected recoveries on financial assets. ASU 2019-05 was issued to provide entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 320-20 with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10. ASU 2019-11 was issued to clarify and address stakeholders' specific issues relating to expected recoveries on purchased credit deteriorated assets and transition and disclosure relief related to troubled debt restructured loans and accrued interest, respectively. Early adoption is permitted. 1st Quarter 2020 The Corporation has developed a CECL allowance model which calculates reserves over the life of the loan and is largely driven by portfolio characteristics, risk-grading, economic outlook, and other key methodology assumptions. Those assumptions are based upon the existing probability of default and loss given default framework. In addition, analysis derived from the Corporation's stress testing processes have been leveraged in the development of CECL models. The Corporation will utilize a single economic forecast over a 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. In the second year the Corporation will use straight-line reversion to historical losses. The Corporation's cross functional team will periodically refine the model as needed. The Corporation expects to incur a $70 to $80 million after-tax charge which will decrease the opening stockholders' equity balance as of January 1, 2020. A majority of the increase is the result of economic uncertainty and unfunded commitments. The total estimated impact equates to a 21 to 24 basis point decrease to the tangible common equity ratio. The Corporation anticipates increases in the allowance for credit losses on longer dated portfolios and decreases in the shorter dated portfolios. The Corporation is in the process of finalizing the review of the most recent model run and finalizing assumptions including qualitative adjustments, probable troubled debt restructurings, and economic forecasts. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START Standard Description Date of anticipated adoption Effect on financial statements ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework&#8212;Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement The FASB issued an amendment to add, modify, and remove disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the FASB Concepts Statement "Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting", including the consideration of costs and benefits. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. Early adoption is permitted. 1st Quarter 2020 Upon adoption, the Corporation will have a slight change in presentation, and an immaterial impact to its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. ASU 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment The FASB issued an amendment to simplify the subsequent quantitative measurement of goodwill by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity will perform only step one of its quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and then recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity will still have the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative step one impairment test is necessary. This amendment is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities should apply the amendment prospectively. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period, for impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. 2nd Quarter 2020, consistent with the Corporation's annual impairment test in May of each year The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The Corporation has not had to perform a step one quantitative analysis since 2012, which concluded no impairment was necessary. ASU 2018-14 Compensation&#8212;Retirement Benefits&#8212;Defined Benefit Plans&#8212;General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework&#8212;Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans The FASB issued an amendment to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments also added requirements to disclose the weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates and an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The amendment also clarifies the disclosure requirements in paragraph 715-20-50-3, which states that certain information for defined benefit pension plans should be disclosed. The amendments in this Update remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. The amendment is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. Entities should apply the amendments in this Update on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. 1st Quarter 2021 The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations, financial position and liquidity. ASU 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes The FASB issued this amendment to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendment also improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. 1st Quarter 2021 The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations, financial position and liquidity. ##TABLE_END 

Note 2 Acquisitions 

2019 Completed Acquisitions: 

Huntington Wisconsin Branch Acquisition 

On June 14, 2019 , the Corporation completed its acquisition of the Wisconsin branches of Huntington . The Corporation paid a 4% premium on acquired deposits. The conversion of the branches happened simultaneously with the close of the transaction and the acquisition expanded the Bank's presence into 13 new Wisconsin communities. As a result of the acquisition and other consolidations, a net of 14 branch locations were added. 

The Huntington branch acquisition constituted a business combination. The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. The determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates that are subjective in nature and may require adjustments upon the availability of new information regarding facts and circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition (i.e., appraisals) for up to a year following the acquisition. 

The Corporation recorded approximately $ 7 million in goodwill related to the Huntington branch acquisition during the second quarter of 2019 and approximately $ 210,000 during the third quarter of 2019. Upon review of information relating to events 

and circumstances existing at the acquisition date, and in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation remeasured select previously reported fair value amounts. The adjustment to goodwill was driven by an update that decreased the fair value of furniture acquired. Goodwill created by the acquisition is tax deductible. See Note 5 for additional information on goodwill, as well as the carrying amount and amortization of core deposit intangible assets related to the Huntington branch acquisition. 

The following table presents the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date related to Huntington branch acquisition:

2019 Pending Acquisitions: 

On July 25, 2019 , the Corporation entered into an agreement to acquire Illinois-based First Staunton for cash consideration of approximately $ 76 million. Regulatory approval for the transaction was received from the OCC on October 10, 2019. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in February 2020. 

2018 Completed Acquisitions: 

Bank Mutual Acquisition 

On February 1, 2018 , the Corporation completed its acquisition of Bank Mutual in a stock transaction valued at approximately $ 482 million. Bank Mutual was a diversified financial services company headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The merger resulted in a combined company with a larger market presence in markets the Corporation currently operates in, as well as expansion into nearly a dozen new markets. 

Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 20, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), Bank Mutual&#8217;s shareholders received 0.422 shares of the Corporation's common stock for each share of Bank Mutual common stock. The Corporation issued approximately 19.5 million shares for a total deal value of approximately $ 482 million based on the closing sale price of a share of common stock of the Corporation on January 31, 2018. The banking subsidiary of Bank Mutual merged with and into Associated Bank, N.A. on June 24, 2018. 

Goodwill related to the Bank Mutual acquisition increased $ 6 million during the second quarter of 2018 and an additional $ 2 million during the third quarter of 2018 to $ 175 million. Goodwill created by the acquisition of Bank Mutual is not tax deductible. 

The following table presents the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date related to Bank Mutual:

Assumptions: 

Loans: Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan, amortization status, and current discount rates. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques. 

CDIs: This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships with deposit customers. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternative cost of funds, and the interest costs associated with customer deposits. The CDIs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. 

Time deposits: The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

FHLB borrowings: The fair values of FHLB advances are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 

Note 3 Investment Securities 

Investment securities are classified as available for sale, held to maturity, or equity on the consolidated balance sheets at the time of purchase. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for investment securities.

During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a one-time election to transfer municipal securities with an amortized cost of $ 692 million from held to maturity to available for sale, as permitted by the adoption of ASU 2019-04 during the quarter. The Corporation sold shorter duration, lower yielding municipal securities that were included in the transfer for proceeds of $ 157 million at a gain of $ 3 million, with the proceeds being reinvested into longer duration, higher yielding held to maturity municipal securities. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2019, the Corporation sold $ 1.2 billion of taxable, floating rate ABS and shorter duration MBS, CMBS, and CMOs Agency securities, with the proceeds utilized to pay down borrowings and to reinvest into higher yielding Agency related mortgage securities with slightly longer durations, repositioning the portfolio for a declining rate environment. 

The Corporation also donated 42,039 shares of Visa Class B restricted shares to the Corporation's Charitable Remainder Trust during the second quarter of 2019, and the subsequent sale of those shares by the Trust resulted in an observable market price. As a result, the Corporation wrote up its remaining 77,000 Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of covered litigation, the shares were previously carried at a zero cost basis. 

During 2018, the Corporation executed a strategy to improve the yield on securities and increase interest income during the current and future calendar years. During the third quarter of 2018, the Corporation sold mortgage-related securities totaling approximately $ 108 million at a slight gain with all proceeds reinvested into higher yielding securities. The tax equivalent yield of the securities sold was 3.08 % while the reinvestment was at 3.51 %. During the second quarter of 2018, the Corporation also sold $ 40 million of lower yielding GNMA commercial mortgage-related securities. 

In addition, on February 1, 2018, the date the Bank Mutual acquisition was completed, the Corporation sold Bank Mutual's entire $ 453 million securities portfolio. The Corporation originally reinvested the proceeds from the Bank Mutual securities portfolio into GNMA residential mortgage-related securities with the goal of reinvesting future cash flows into municipal securities. That strategy was completed during August 2018. 

During 2017, the Corporation sold approximately $ 18 million of municipal securities classified as held to maturity due to significant credit concerns and negative actions taken by credit rating agencies, primarily as a result of budgetary pressures in the State of Illinois and State of Connecticut. These sales resulted in a net gain of approximately $ 434,000 . 

Investment securities with a carrying value of approximately $ 2.6 billion and $ 3.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, were pledged to secure certain deposits or for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

The Corporation reviews the investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to monitor its exposure to other-than-temporary impairment. A determination as to whether a security&#8217;s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Some factors the Corporation may consider in the other-than-temporary impairment analysis include the length of time and extent to which the security has been in 

an unrealized loss position, changes in security ratings, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as security and industry specific economic conditions. 

Based on the Corporation&#8217;s evaluation, management does not believe any unrealized loss at December 31, 2019 represents an other-than-temporary impairment as these unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and the current market conditions, and not credit deterioration. The unrealized losses reported for municipal securities relate to various state and local political subdivisions and school districts. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2019 for mortgage-related securities have declined due to the decrease in overall interest rates. The U.S. Treasury 3 year and 5 year rates decreased by 84 bp and 82 bp, respectively, from December 31, 2018. The Corporation does not intend to sell nor does it believe that it will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank Stocks: The Corporation is required to maintain Federal Reserve stock and FHLB stock as a member bank of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, and in amounts as required by these institutions. These equity securities are &#8220;restricted&#8221; in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other marketable equity securities and their fair value is equal to amortized cost. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation had FHLB stock of $ 149 million and $ 173 million, respectively. The Corporation had Federal Reserve Bank stock of $ 78 million and $ 77 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values: The Corporation's portfolio of equity securities with readily determinable fair values is primarily comprised of CRA Qualified Investment mutual funds. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation had equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $ 2 million. 

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values: The Corporation's portfolio of equity securities without readily determinable fair values consists of Visa Class B restricted shares that the Corporation received in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. During the second quarter of 2019, the Corporation donated 42,039 shares of Visa Class B restricted shares to the Corporation's Charitable Remainder Trust, and the subsequent sale of those shares by the Trust resulted in an observable market price. As a result, the Corporation wrote up their remaining 77,000 Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the Visa Class B restricted shares were previously carried at a zero cost basis. Thus, the Corporation had equity securities without readily determinable fair values of $ 13 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 0 at December 31, 2018.

Factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, an appropriate allowance for loan losses, allowance for unfunded commitments, nonaccrual, and charge off policies. See Note 1 for the Corporation's accounting policy for loans. 

For commercial loans, management has determined the pass credit quality indicator to include credits that exhibit acceptable financial statements, cash flow, and leverage. If any risk exists, it is mitigated by the loan structure, collateral, monitoring, or control. For consumer loans, performing loans include credits performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Special mention credits have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit. Potential problem loans are considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged. These 

loans generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which may jeopardize liquidation of the debt, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Lastly, management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement, including both principal and interest. Management has determined that commercial and consumer loan relationships in nonaccrual status or those with their terms restructured in a troubled debt restructuring meet this impaired loan definition. Commercial loans classified as special mention, potential problem, and nonaccrual are reviewed at a minimum on a quarterly basis, while pass and performing rated credits are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if the loan renewal is less than one year or if otherwise warranted.

Restructured loan modifications may include payment schedule modifications, interest rate concessions, maturity date extensions, modification of note structure (A/B Note), non-reaffirmed Chapter 7 bankruptcies, principal reduction, or some combination of these concessions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, restructured loan modifications of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and real estate construction loans primarily included maturity date extensions, interest rate concessions, payment schedule modifications, or a combination of these concessions. Restructured loan modifications of home equity and residential mortgage loans primarily included maturity date extensions, interest rate concessions, non-reaffirmed Chapter 7 bankruptcies, or a combination of these concessions. 

The following table provides the number of loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the previous twelve months which subsequently defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as well as the recorded investment in these restructured loans as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively:

All loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are evaluated for impairment. The nature and extent of the impairment of restructured loans, including those which have experienced a subsequent payment default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The level of the allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of an amount appropriate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. See Note 1 for the Corporation's accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 16 for additional information on the allowance for unfunded commitments. 

A summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the year ended December 31, 2019, is as follows:

Loans Acquired in Acquisition 

Loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses. Acquired loans are segregated into two types: 

&#8226; Performing loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 310-20 "Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs" as these loans do not have evidence of credit deterioration since origination. 

&#8226; Nonperforming loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 310-30 as they display significant credit deterioration since origination. 

For performing loans the difference between the estimated fair value of the loans and the principal outstanding is accreted over the remaining life of the loans. 

In accordance with ASC 310-30, purchased credit-impaired loans are pooled by loan type and the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Further, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan pools when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows. If a reasonable expectation on the amount or timing of such cash flows cannot be determined, accretion of the fair value discount for nonperforming loans will be recognized using the cost recovery method of accounting. 

Changes in the accretable yield for loans acquired and accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30 were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018 respectively: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Changes in Accretable Yield Balance at beginning of period $ 1,482 &#160; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; Purchases &#8212; &#160; &#160; 4,853 &#160; &#160; Accretion ( 940 ) &#160; ( 4,954 ) &#160; Net reclassification from non-accretable yield 23 &#160; &#160; 1,605 &#160; &#160;

(a) Primarily includes charge offs which are accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 "Receivables &#8212; Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality." 

For loans acquired, the fair value of purchased credit-impaired loans, on the acquisition date, was determined based on assigned risk ratings, expected cash flows and the fair value of loan collateral. The fair value of loans that were non-impaired was determined based on estimates of losses on defaults and other market factors. The Corporation's Huntington branch acquisition included no purchased credit-impaired loans. 

At December 31, 2019, the Corporation had a total of approximately $ 12 million in net unaccreted purchase discount, of which approximately $ 12 million was related to performing loans and less than $1 million was related to the Corporation's purchased credit-impaired loans. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a total of approximately $ 20 million in net unaccreted purchase discount, of which approximately $ 18 million was related to performing loans and approximately $ 2 million was related to the Corporation's purchased credit-impaired loans. 

Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill &#160; 

Goodwill is not amortized but is instead subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets. 

The Corporation conducted its most recent annual impairment testing in May 2019, utilizing a qualitative assessment. Factors that management considered in this assessment included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the Corporation and each reporting unit (both current and projected), changes in management strategy, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets. In addition, management considered the changes in both the Corporation&#8217;s common stock price and in the overall bank common stock index (based on the S&#38;P 400 Regional Bank Sub-Industry Index), as well as the Corporation&#8217;s earnings per common share trend over the past year. Based on these assessments, management concluded that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill) for each reporting unit. Therefore, a step one quantitative analysis was not required. There were no events since the May 2019 impairment testing that have changed the Corporation's impairment assessment conclusion. There were no impairment charges recorded in 2019, 2018, or 2017. 

The Corporation had goodwill of $ 1.2 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Goodwill increased $ 7 million in 2019, due to the Huntington branch acquisition. During 2018, goodwill increased $ 175 million related to the Bank Mutual acquisition, $ 10 million related to the acquisition of Diversified, and $ 7 million related to the acquisition of Anderson. See Note 2 for additional information on the Corporation's acquisitions. 

Other Intangible Assets &#160; 

The Corporation has other intangible assets that are amortized, consisting of CDIs, other intangibles (primarily related to customer relationships acquired in connection with the Corporation&#8217;s insurance agency acquisitions), and MSRs. For CDIs and other intangibles, changes in the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization, and net book value were as follows:

Mortgage Servicing Rights &#160; 

The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically retains the right to service the loans sold. MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income, and assessed for impairment at each reporting date. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for MSRs. See Note 16 for a discussion of the recourse provisions on sold residential mortgage loans. See Note 18 which further discusses fair value measurement relative to the MSRs asset. 

A summary of changes in the balance of the MSRs asset and the MSRs valuation allowance is as follows:

Depreciation and amortization of premises and equipment totaled $ 34 million for both 2019 and 2018, and totaled $ 32 million in 2017. 

During 2019, the Corporation acquired properties as a result of the Huntington branch acquisition which resulted in an increase in the net book value of buildings and improvements from 2018. 

On January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective approach which required operating leases to be capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets. This resulted in a right-of-use asset of $ 45 million at December 31, 2019 compared to zero at December 31, 2018 . See Note 7 for additional information on operating leases. 

Note 7 Leases 

The Corporation has operating leases for retail and corporate offices, land, and equipment. The Corporation also has a finance lease for land. 

These leases have original terms of 1 year or longer with remaining maturities up to 43 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term. An analysis of the lease options has been completed and any optional periods that the Corporation is reasonably likely to extend have been included in the capitalization. 

The discount rate used to capitalize the operating leases is the Corporation's FHLB borrowing rate on the date of lease commencement. When determining the rate to discount specific lease obligations, the repayment period and term are considered. 

Operating and finance lease costs and cash flows resulting from these leases are presented below:

As of December 31, 2019 , additional operating leases, primarily retail and corporate offices, that had not yet commenced at December 31, 2019 total $ 16 million. In addition, finance leases that had not yet commenced at December 31, 2019 total $ 2 million. These leases will commence between January 2020 and July 2023 with lease terms of 3 years to 6 years. 

The Corporation conducts a portion of its business through certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases. The Corporation also leases a subdivision of some of its facilities and receives rental income from such lease agreements. The approximate minimum annual rental payments and rental receipts under noncancelable agreements and leases with remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Total rental expense under leases, net of lease income, totaled $ 5 million in 2019, $ 10 million in 2018, and $ 6 million in 2017, respectively. 

Practical Expedients 

The Corporation elected several practical expedients made available by the FASB. Due to materiality, the Corporation elected not to restate comparative periods upon adoption of the new guidance. In addition, the Corporation elected the package of practical expedients whereby the Corporation did not reassess (i) whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and (ii) lease classification for existing leases. Lastly, the Corporation elected not to separate lease and non-lease components in determining the consideration in the lease agreement.

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase 

The Corporation enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Corporation may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Corporation to repurchase the assets. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts (i.e., there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities). See Note 15 for additional disclosures on balance sheet offsetting. 

The Corporation utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase to facilitate the needs of its customers. As of December 31, 2019, the Corporation pledged agency mortgage-related securities with a fair value of $ 153 million as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Corporation's safekeeping agents and are monitored on a daily basis due to the market risk of fair value changes in the underlying securities. The Corporation generally pledges excess securities to ensure there is sufficient collateral to satisfy short-term fluctuations in both the repurchase agreement balances and the fair value of the underlying securities. 

The remaining contractual maturity of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are presented in the following table:

Long-Term Funding 

Senior Notes &#160; 

In August 2018 , the Bank issued $ 300 million of senior notes, due August 2021 , and callable July 2021 . The senior notes have a fixed coupon interest rate of 3.50 % and were issued at a discount. 

In November 2014 , the Corporation issued $ 250 million of senior notes, due November 2019 , and callable October 2019 . The senior notes had a fixed coupon interest rate of 2.75 % and were issued at a discount. On October 15, 2019 , these notes were redeemed in full. 

Subordinated Notes &#160; 

In November 2014 , the Corporation issued $ 250 million of 10 -year subordinated notes, due January 2025 , and callable October 2024 . The subordinated notes have a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.25 % and were issued at a discount. 

Finance Leases 

The Corporation entered into a 40 -year land lease, maturing August 2059 , with an option to purchase in August 2022. The finance lease has a fixed interest rate of 3.99 %. 

FHLB Advances &#160; 

At December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $ 3.2 billion of FHLB advances, down $ 393 million from December 31, 2018. 

As of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $ 1.5 billion of putable FHLB advances with a one-time option where the FHLB can call the advance prior to the contractual maturity. The contractual weighted average life to the put date of these advances was 0.27 years, with each of the options set to expire in 2020. The weighted average life to contractual maturity on these advances was 5.66 years, with those dates ranging from 2023 through 2028. As of December 31, 2019, due to the lower rate environment, it is probable that none of these advances will be called by the FHLB and will extend to their final maturities. 

Under agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, FHLB advances (short-term and long-term) are secured by qualifying mortgages of the subsidiary bank (such as residential mortgage, residential mortgage loans held for sale, home equity, and commercial real estate).

Note 11 Stock-Based Compensation 

Stock-Based Compensation Plan 

In February 2017, the Board of Directors, with subsequent approval of the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders, approved the adoption of the 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan. All remaining shares available for grant under the 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan were rolled into the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 7.6 million shares remained available for grant under the 2017 Plan. 

Under the 2017 Plan, options are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant, have an exercise price that is equal to the closing price of the Corporation&#8217;s stock on the grant date, and vest ratably over four years . 

The Corporation also issues restricted stock awards under the 2017 Plan. The shares of restricted stock are restricted as to transfer, but are not restricted as to dividend payment or voting rights. Restricted stock units receive dividend equivalents but do not have voting rights. The transfer restrictions lapse over three years or four years , depending upon whether the awards are performance-based or service-based. Performance-based awards are based on earnings per share performance goals, relative total shareholder return, and continued employment or meeting the requirements for retirement and service-based awards are contingent upon continued employment or meeting the requirements for retirement. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest over a performance period of three years and service-based restricted stock awards vest ratably over four years . 

The 2017 Plan provides that restricted stock awards and stock options will immediately become fully vested upon retirement from the Corporation of retirement eligible colleagues. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for stock based compensation. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 

The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, while the fair value of restricted stock awards is their fair market value on the date of grant. The fair values of stock options and restricted stock awards are amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For retirement eligible colleagues, expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards are fully recognized on the date the colleague meets the definition of normal or early retirement. Compensation expense recognized is included in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of income. 

Performance awards are based on performance goals of earnings per share and total shareholder return with vesting ranging from a minimum of 0 % to a maximum of 150 % of the target award. Performance awards are valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of the awards at the grant date. 

Assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted. The weighted average expected life of the stock option represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated using historical data of stock option exercises and forfeitures. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of the Corporation&#8217;s stock. The following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value for options granted in 2019, 2018, and 2017: 

##TABLE_START 2019 2018 2017 Dividend yield 3.30 &#160; % 2.50 &#160; % 2.00 &#160; % Risk-free interest rate 2.60 &#160; % 2.60 &#160; % 2.00 &#160; % Weighted average expected volatility 24.00 &#160; % 22.00 &#160; % 25.00 &#160; % Weighted average expected life 5.75 years 5.75 years 5.5 years Weighted average per share fair value of options $ 4.00 $ 4.47 $ 5.30 ##TABLE_END

Intrinsic value represents the amount by which the fair market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 the intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 4 million, $ 10 million, and $ 13 million, respectively. The total fair value of stock options that vested was $ 3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $ 4 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Corporation recognized compensation expense of $ 4 million for each of the three years, for the vesting of stock options. Included in compensation expense for 2019 was $1 million of expense for the accelerated vesting of stock options granted to retirement eligible colleagues.

(a) In thousands 

The Corporation amortizes the expense related to restricted stock awards as compensation expense over the vesting period specified in the grant. Expense for restricted stock awards of approximately $ 21 million was recorded for year ended December 31, 2019, $ 13 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $ 18 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in compensation expense for 2019 was approximately $ 4 million of expense for the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards granted to retirement eligible colleagues. The Corporation had $ 20 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock awards at December 31, 2019, that is expected to be recognized over the remaining requisite service periods that extend predominantly through first quarter 2023 . The Corporation has the ability to issue shares from treasury or new shares upon the exercise of stock options or the granting of restricted stock awards. 

As described in Note 10, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available for issuance in connection with the Corporation&#8217;s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes. The repurchase of shares will be based on market and investment opportunities, capital levels, growth prospects, and the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals. Such repurchases may occur from time to time in open market purchases, block transactions, private transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, or similar facilities. 

Note 12 Retirement Plans 

The Corporation has a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan, the RAP, covering substantially all employees who meet participation requirements. The benefits are based primarily on years of service and the employee&#8217;s compensation paid. Employees of acquired entities generally participate in the RAP after consummation of the business combinations. Any retirement plans of acquired entities are typically merged into the RAP after completion of the mergers, and credit is usually given to employees for years of service at the acquired institution for vesting and eligibility purposes. 

The Corporation also provides legacy healthcare access to a limited group of retired employees from a previous acquisition in the Postretirement Plan. There are no other active retiree healthcare plans. 

Bank Mutual was acquired on February 1, 2018 . The Bank Mutual Pension Plan was merged into the RAP on December 31, 2018. Bank Mutual's Postretirement Plan was merged into the Corporation's Postretirement Plan during the first quarter of 2018. The reported figures in 2018 for both the RAP and Postretirement Plan only include 11 months of Bank Mutual expense due to the timing of the Bank Mutual acquisition. 

The Huntington branch acquisition closed on June 14, 2019 , and the employees gained as a result of the transaction became eligible to participate in the RAP on the same date, with their vesting service credit based on their prior hours of service with Huntington. See Note 2 for additional information on the Huntington branch acquisition. 

The funded status and amounts recognized in the 2019 and 2018 consolidated balance sheets, as measured on December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the RAP and Postretirement Plan were as follows:

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Interest cost $ 104 &#160; &#160; $ 108 &#160; &#160; $ 101 &#160; &#160; Amortization of prior service cost ( 75 ) &#160; ( 75 ) &#160; ( 75 ) &#160; Amortization of actuarial loss (gain) ( 4 ) &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; Total net periodic benefit cost $ 25 &#160; &#160; $ 41 &#160; &#160; $ 30 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END

The components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic benefit cost, other than the service cost component, are included in the line item other of noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of income. The service cost components are included in personnel on the consolidated statements of income. 

As of December 31, 2019, the estimated actuarial losses and prior service cost that will be amortized during 2020 from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the RAP includes expense of $ 3 million for actuarial losses and income of approximately $ 75,000 for the prior service cost. For the Postretirement Plan, the estimated actuarial losses and prior service cost that will be amortized during 2020 from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost includes income of approximately $ 75,000 for the prior service cost while no actuarial gains or losses are expected.

(b) Weighted average of the 2018 fiscal year expected return on asset assumption for the RAP was 6.00 % and the Bank Mutual Pension Plan was 5.50 % 

The expected long-term (more than 20 years) rate of return was estimated using market benchmarks for equities and bonds applied to the RAP&#8217;s anticipated asset allocations. The expected return on equities was computed utilizing a valuation framework, which projected future returns based on current equity valuations rather than historical returns. The actual rates of return for the RAP assets were 18.29 % and ( 3.69 )% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

The RAP&#8217;s investments are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risks associated with certain investments and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of the investments, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term could materially affect the amounts reported. The investment objective for the RAP is to maximize total return with a tolerance for average risk. The RAP has a diversified portfolio designed to provide liquidity, current income, and growth of income and principal, with anticipated asset allocation ranges of: equity securities 50 to 70 %, fixed-income securities 30 to 50 %, other cash equivalents 0 to 10 %, and alternative securities 0 to 15 %. Based on changes in economic and market conditions, the Corporation could be outside of the allocation ranges for brief periods of time. The asset allocation for the RAP as of the December 31, 2019 and 2018 measurement dates, respectively, by asset category were as follows: 

##TABLE_START Asset Category 2019 2018 Equity securities 51 &#160; % 49 &#160; % Fixed-income securities 33 &#160; % 34 &#160; % Group annuity contracts 11 &#160; % 12 &#160; % Alternative securities 3 &#160; % 3 &#160; % Other 2 &#160; % 2 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END 

The RAP assets include cash equivalents, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, common / collective trust funds (which include investments in equity and bond securities), and a group annuity contract. Money market accounts are stated at cost plus accrued interest, mutual funds are valued at quoted market prices, investments in common / collective trust funds are valued at the amount at which units in the funds can be withdrawn, and the group annuity contract is valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations and considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The group annuity contract was obtained as part of the Bank Mutual Pension Plan that was acquired on February 1, 2018 and merged into the RAP on December 31, 2018. 

Based on these inputs, the following table summarizes the fair value of the RAP&#8217;s investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:

The following presents a summary of the changes in the fair value of the RAP's Level 3 asset during the periods indicated. As noted above, the Corporation's Level 3 asset consists entirely of a group annuity contract issued by a life insurance company. 

##TABLE_START Fair Value Reconciliation of Level 3 RAP Investments 2019 2018 (a)

(a) Period begins on February 1, the date the Corporation acquired the group annuity contract from the Bank Mutual acquisition. 

The Corporation&#8217;s funding policy is to pay at least the minimum amount required by federal law and regulations, with consideration given to the maximum funding amounts allowed. The Corporation regularly reviews the funding of its RAP. The Corporation did no t make any contributions to the RAP during 2019. The Corporation made contributions of $ 38 million to the Bank Mutual Pension Plan and $ 4 million to the RAP during 2018, with the plans merging on December 31, 2018. 

The projected benefit payments were calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the benefit obligations listed above. The projected benefit payments for the RAP and Postretirement Plan at December 31, 2019, reflecting expected future services, were as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) RAP Postretirement Plan Estimated future benefit payments 2020 $ 19,659 &#160; &#160; $ 218 &#160; &#160; 2021 19,755 &#160; &#160; 213 &#160; &#160; 2022 20,729 &#160; &#160; 208 &#160; &#160; 2023 20,392 &#160; &#160; 202 &#160; &#160; 2024 20,710 &#160; &#160; 196 &#160; &#160; 2025-2029 91,264 &#160; &#160; 867 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END

The health care trend rate is an assumption as to how much the Postretirement Plan&#8217;s medical costs will change each year in the future. There are no remaining participants under age 65 in the Postretirement Plan. The actual change in 2019 health care premium rates for post-65 coverage was an increase of 2.00 %. The health care trend rate assumption for post-65 coverage is an increase of 5.75 % in 2020 with the rate of increase decreasing 0.25 % in each succeeding year, to an ultimate rate of 5.00 % for 2023 and future years. 

A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: 

##TABLE_START &#160; 2019 2018 ($ in Thousands) 100 bp Increase 100 bp Decrease 100 bp Increase 100 bp Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 7 &#160; &#160; $ ( 6 ) &#160; $ 7 &#160; &#160; $ ( 6 ) &#160; Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 170 &#160; &#160; $ ( 148 ) &#160; $ 164 &#160; &#160; $ ( 143 ) &#160; ##TABLE_END

The Corporation also has a 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the &#8220;401(k) plan&#8221;). The Corporation&#8217;s contribution is determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors. Total expenses related to contributions to the 401(k) plan were $ 16 million, $ 16 million, and $ 14 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 

Note 13 Income Taxes 

The current and deferred amounts of income tax expense (benefit) were as follows:

Temporary differences between the amounts reported on the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities resulted in deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $ 251,000 was related to the deferred tax benefit of specific federal tax loss carryforwards of $ 3 million from a 2017 acquisition. The changes in the valuation allowance related to net operating losses for 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) 2019 2018 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, beginning of year $ ( 251 ) &#160; $ ( 269 ) &#160; (Increase) decrease in current year &#8212; &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, end of year $ ( 251 ) &#160; $ ( 251 ) &#160; ##TABLE_END 

At December 31, 2019, the Corporation had state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 106 million (of which $ 49 million was acquired from various acquisitions) that will begin expiring in 2031 . At December 31, 2019, the Corporation had state tax credit carryforwards of $ 5 million that will begin expiring in 2034 . 

The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate. The major reasons for this difference were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2019 2018 2017 Federal income tax rate at statutory rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 35.0 &#160; % Increases (decreases) resulting from: Tax-exempt interest and dividends ( 3.3 ) % ( 2.6 ) % ( 4.1 ) % State income taxes (net of federal benefit) 3.5 &#160; % 3.7 &#160; % 2.9 &#160; % Bank owned life insurance ( 0.8 ) % ( 0.7 ) % ( 1.7 ) % Tax effect of tax credits and benefits, net of related expenses ( 0.9 ) % ( 0.7 ) % ( 0.7 ) % Tax reserve adjustments / settlements 0.2 &#160; % 1.5 &#160; % ( 1.2 ) % Net tax benefit from stock-based compensation ( 0.2 ) % ( 0.5 ) % ( 1.3 ) % Tax Act impact on deferred remeasurement &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % 3.5 &#160; % Tax planning in response to the Tax Act &#8212; &#160; % ( 3.6 ) % &#8212; &#160; % FDIC premium 0.5 &#160; % 0.9 &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % Other ( 0.4 ) % 0.3 &#160; % ( 0.1 ) % Effective income tax rate 19.6 &#160; % 19.3 &#160; % 32.3 &#160; % ##TABLE_END

Savings banks acquired by the Corporation in 1997 and 2004 qualified under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that permitted them to deduct from taxable income an allowance for bad debts that differed from the provision for such losses charged to income for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made for $ 100 million of retained income at December 31, 2019. If income taxes had been provided, the deferred tax liability would have been approximately $ 25 million. Management does not expect this amount to become taxable in the future; therefore, no provision for income taxes has been made. 

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Corporation&#8217;s federal income tax returns are open and subject to examination from the 2016 tax return year and forward. The years open to examination by state and local government authorities varies by jurisdiction. 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Millions) 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of year $ 2 &#160; &#160; $ 4 &#160; &#160; Subtractions for tax positions related to prior years &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; Subtractions for settlements with tax authorities &#8212; &#160; &#160; ( 3 ) &#160; Additions for tax positions related to current year 1 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; Balance at end of year $ 3 &#160; &#160; $ 2 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were $ 2 million and $ 1 million, respectively. 

The Corporation recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line on the consolidated statements of income. Interest and penalty benefits were negligible at December 31, 2019 and $ 1 million December 31, 2018. Accrued interest and penalties were negligible at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Management does not anticipate significant adjustments to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 

Note 14 Derivative and Hedging Activities 

The Corporation is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Corporation principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Corporation manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Corporation enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Corporation's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Corporation's known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Corporation's assets. 

The contract or notional amount of a derivative is used to determine, along with the other terms of the derivative, the amounts to be exchanged between the counterparties. The Corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments. To mitigate the counterparty risk, contracts generally contain language outlining collateral pledging requirements for each counterparty. For non-centrally cleared derivatives, collateral must be posted when the market value exceeds certain mutually agreed upon threshold limits. Securities and cash are often pledged as collateral. The Corporation pledged $ 57 million of investment securities as collateral at December 31, 2019, and pledged $ 36 million of investment securities as collateral at December 31, 2018. Cash is often pledged as collateral for interest rate swaps and derivatives that are not centrally cleared. At December 31, 2019, the Corporation posted $ 14 million cash collateral compared to $ 1 million at December 31, 2018. 

Federal regulations require the Corporation to clear all LIBOR interest rate swaps through a clearing house, if possible. For derivatives cleared through central clearing houses the variation margin payments are legally characterized as daily settlements of the derivative rather than collateral. The Corporation's clearing agent for interest rate derivative contracts that are centrally cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Clearing House (LCH) settles the variation margin daily. As a result, the variation margin payment and the related derivative instruments are considered a single unit of account for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Depending on the net position, the fair value is reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The daily settlement of the derivative exposure does not change or reset the contractual terms of the instrument. 

See Note 18 for fair value information and disclosures and see Note 1 for the Corporation's accounting policy for derivative and hedging activities. 

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Corporation is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Corporation used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involved the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Corporation receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk were recognized in interest income. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Corporation terminated the outstanding fair value hedges. 

Derivatives to Accommodate Customer Needs 

The Corporation also facilitates customer borrowing activity by entering into various derivative contracts which are designated as free standing derivative contracts. Free standing derivative products are entered into primarily for the benefit of commercial customers seeking to manage their exposures to interest rate risk, foreign currency, and commodity prices. These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Such derivative contracts are carried at fair value in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value recorded as a component of capital markets, net, and typically include interest rate-related instruments (swaps and caps), foreign currency exchange forwards, and commodity contracts. See Note 15 for additional information and disclosures on balance sheet offsetting. 

Interest rate-related instruments: The Corporation provides interest rate risk management services to commercial customers, primarily forward interest rate swaps and caps. The Corporation&#8217;s market risk from unfavorable movements in interest rates related to these derivative contracts is generally economically hedged by concurrently entering into offsetting derivative contracts. The offsetting derivative contracts have identical notional values, terms, and indices. 

Foreign currency exchange forwards: The Corporation provides foreign currency exchange services to customers, primarily forward contracts. The Corporation's customers enter into a foreign currency exchange forward with the Corporation as a means for them to mitigate exchange rate risk. The Corporation mitigates its risk by then entering into an offsetting foreign currency exchange derivative contract. 

Commodity contracts: Commodity contracts are entered into primarily for the benefit of commercial customers seeking to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. The Corporation mitigates its risk by then entering into an offsetting commodity derivative contract. 

Mortgage Derivatives 

Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans are considered derivative instruments, and the fair value of these commitments is recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with the changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking, net. 

Written and Purchased Options (Time Deposit) 

Historically, the Corporation had entered into written and purchased option derivative instruments to facilitate an equity linked time deposit product (the &#8220;Power CD&#8221;), which the Corporation ceased offering in September 2013. The Power CD was a time deposit that provided the purchaser a guaranteed return of principal at maturity plus a potential equity return (a written option), while the Corporation received a known stream of funds based on the equity return (a purchased option).

Note 15 Balance Sheet Offsetting 

Interest Rate-Related Instruments, Commodity Contracts, and Foreign Exchange Forwards (&#8220;Interest, Commodity, and Foreign Exchange Agreements&#8221;) 

The Corporation enters into interest rate-related instruments to facilitate the interest rate risk management strategies of commercial customers, commodity contracts to manage commercial customers' exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, and foreign exchange forwards to manage customers' exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. The Corporation mitigates these risks by entering into equal and offsetting agreements with highly rated third-party financial institutions. The Corporation is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties that create single net settlements of all legal claims or obligations to pay or receive the net amount of settlement of the individual interest, commodity, and foreign exchange agreements. Collateral, usually in the form of investment securities and cash, is posted by the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds. Derivatives subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement are reported on a net basis, net of cash collateral, in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. In the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation elected to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. See the 

derivatives section within Note 1 for additional information on the change in accounting policy and Note 14 for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s derivative and hedging activities. 

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase 

The Corporation enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. These repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities (i.e., there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities). The right of set-off for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Corporation be in default (e.g., fails to make an interest payment to the counterparty). In addition, the Corporation does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements; therefore, there is no such offsetting to be done with the repurchase agreements. See Note 9 for additional disclosures on repurchase agreements. 

The following table presents the assets and liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement. The interest, commodity and foreign exchange agreements we have with our commercial customers are not subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, and therefore, are excluded from this table:

Note 16 Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Legal Proceedings 

The Corporation utilizes a variety of financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to manage its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include lending-related and other commitments (see below) as well as derivative instruments (see Note 14). The following is a summary of lending-related commitments: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) 2019 2018 

Commitments to extend credit, excluding commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale (a)(b)

Standby letters of credit (c)

(a) These off-balance sheet financial instruments are exercisable at the market rate prevailing at the date the underlying transaction will be completed and, thus, are deemed to have no current fair value, or the fair value is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and was not material at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

(b) Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale are considered derivative instruments and are disclosed in Note 14. 

(c) The Corporation has established a liability of $ 3 million and $ 2 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, as an estimate of the fair value of these financial instruments. 

Lending-related Commitments 

As a financial services provider, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the Corporation, with each customer&#8217;s creditworthiness evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The Corporation&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The amount of 

collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the customer. Since a significant portion of commitments to extend credit are subject to specific restrictive loan covenants or may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. An allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded commitments (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit). The allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $ 22 million and $ 24 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy on the allowance for unfunded commitments. See Note 4 for additional information on the allowance for unfunded commitments. 

Lending-related commitments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers at predetermined interest rates, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans are considered derivative instruments, and the fair value of these commitments is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation&#8217;s derivative and hedging activity is further described in Note 14. Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party, while standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party. 

Other Commitments 

The Corporation invests in qualified affordable housing projects, federal and state historic projects, new market projects, and opportunity zone funds for the purpose of community reinvestment and obtaining tax credits and other tax benefits. Return on the Corporation's investment in these projects and funds comes in the form of tax credits and tax losses that pass through to the Corporation, and deferral or elimination of capital gain recognition for tax purposes. The aggregate carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2019, was $ 248 million, compared to $ 136 million at December 31, 2018, included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation utilizes the proportional amortization method to account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

Under the proportional amortization method, the Corporation amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits. The Corporation recognized additional income tax expense attributable to the amortization of investments in qualified affordable housing projects of $ 19 million, $ 17 million, and $ 8 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The Corporation's remaining investment in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for under the proportional amortization method totaled $ 234 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 132 million at December 31, 2018. 

The Corporation&#8217;s unfunded equity contributions relating to investments in qualified affordable housing, federal and state historic projects, and new market projects are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation&#8217;s remaining unfunded equity contributions totaled $ 123 million and $ 51 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation did not record any impairment related to qualified affordable housing investments. 

The Corporation has principal investment commitments to provide capital-based financing to private and public companies through either direct investment in specific companies or through investment funds and partnerships. The timing of future cash requirements to fund such principal investment commitments is generally dependent on the investment cycle, whereby privately held companies are funded by private equity investors and ultimately sold, merged, or taken public through an initial offering, which can vary based on overall market conditions, as well as the nature and type of industry in which the companies operate. The Corporation also invests in loan pools that support CRA loans. The timing of future cash requirements to fund these pools is dependent upon loan demand, which can vary over time. The aggregate carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2019, was $ 26 million, compared to $ 25 million at December 31, 2018, included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Legal Proceedings 

The Corporation is party to various pending and threatened claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcomes, the Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding matters and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously with respect to such legal proceedings. The Corporation will consider settlement of cases when, in management&#8217;s judgment, it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. 

On at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with all pending or threatened claims and litigation, utilizing the most recent information available. On a matter by matter basis, an accrual for loss is established for those matters which the Corporation believes it is probable that a loss may be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, each accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any subsequent developments. Accordingly, management&#8217;s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established. 

Resolution of legal claims is inherently unpredictable, and in many legal proceedings various factors exacerbate this inherent unpredictability, including where the damages sought are unsubstantiated or indeterminate, it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis, discovery is not complete, the proceeding is not yet in its final stages, the matters present legal uncertainties, there are significant facts in dispute, there are a large number of parties (including where it is uncertain how liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants), or there is a wide range of potential results. 

The Corporation does not believe it is presently subject to any legal proceedings the resolution of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. 

Regulatory Matters 

A variety of consumer products, including mortgage and deposit products, and certain fees and charges related to such products, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny. It is possible that regulatory authorities could bring enforcement actions, including civil money penalties, or take other actions against the Corporation and the Bank in regard to these consumer products. The Bank could also determine of its own accord, or be required by regulators, to refund or otherwise make remediation payments to customers in connection with these products. It is not possible at this time for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss related to such matters. 

Mortgage Repurchase Reserve 

The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans to investors in the normal course of business. Residential mortgage loans sold to others are predominantly conventional residential first lien mortgages originated under the Corporation's usual underwriting procedures, and are most often sold on a nonrecourse basis, primarily to the GSEs. The Corporation&#8217;s agreements to sell residential mortgage loans in the normal course of business usually require certain representations and warranties on the underlying loans sold, related to credit information, loan documentation, collateral, and insurability. Subsequent to being sold, if a material underwriting deficiency or documentation defect is discovered, the Corporation may be obligated to repurchase the loan or reimburse the GSEs for losses incurred (collectively, &#8220;make whole requests&#8221;). The make whole requests and any related risk of loss under the representations and warranties are largely driven by borrower performance. 

As a result of make whole requests, the Corporation has repurchased loans with principal balances of approximately $ 2 million for both years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The loss reimbursement and settlement claims paid for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were negligible . Make whole requests during 2018 and 2019 generally arose from loans sold during the period of January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2018. Since January 1, 2012, loans sold totaled $ 12.5 billion at the time of sale, and consisted primarily of loans sold to GSEs. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $ 7.4 billion of these sold loans remain outstanding. 

The balance in the mortgage repurchase reserve at the balance sheet date reflects the estimated amount of potential loss the Corporation could incur from repurchasing a loan, as well as loss reimbursements, indemnifications, and other settlement resolutions. The mortgage repurchase reserve was approximately $ 795,000 and $ 752,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

The Corporation may also sell residential mortgage loans with limited recourse (limited in that the recourse period ends prior to the loan&#8217;s maturity, usually after certain time and / or loan paydown criteria have been met), whereby repurchase could be required if the loan had defined delinquency issues during the limited recourse periods. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were approximately $ 39 million and $ 47 million, respectively, of residential mortgage loans sold 

with such recourse risk. There have been limited instances and immaterial historical losses on repurchases for recourse under the limited recourse criteria. 

The Corporation has a subordinate position to the FHLB in the credit risk on residential mortgage loans it sold to the FHLB in exchange for a monthly credit enhancement fee. The Corporation has not sold loans to the FHLB with such credit risk retention since February 2005. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were $ 45 million and $ 57 million, respectively, of such residential mortgage loans with credit risk recourse, upon which there have been negligible historical losses to the Corporation.

Note 18 Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value represents the estimated price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price concept). See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for fair value measurements. 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Corporation&#8217;s more significant instruments measured on a recurring basis at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Investment Securities Available For Sale: Where quoted prices are available in an active market, investment securities are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, with consideration given to the nature of the quote and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the fair value estimate, and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Lastly, in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the estimated fair value, securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. To validate the fair value estimates, assumptions, and controls, the Corporation looks to transactions for similar instruments and utilizes independent pricing provided by third party vendors or brokers and relevant market indices. While none of these sources are solely indicative of fair value, they serve as directional indicators for the appropriateness of the Corporation&#8217;s fair value estimates. The Corporation has determined that the fair value measures of its investment securities are classified predominantly within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 3 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities. 

Equity Securities with Readily Determinable Fair Values: The Corporation's portfolio of equity securities with readily determinable fair values is primarily comprised of CRA Qualified Investment mutual funds. Since quoted prices for the Corporation's equity securities are readily available in an active market, they are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 3 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s equity securities. 

Residential Loans Held For Sale: Residential loans held for sale, which consist generally of current production of certain fixed-rate, first-lien residential mortgage loans, are carried at estimated fair value. Management has elected the fair value option to account for all newly originated mortgage loans held for sale, which results in the financial impact of changing market conditions being reflected currently in earnings as opposed to being dependent upon the timing of sales. Therefore, the continually adjusted values better reflect the price the Corporation expects to receive from the sale of such loans. The estimated fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics, which the Corporation classifies as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Interest Rate-Related Instruments): The Corporation utilizes interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to interest rate risk and variability of fair value related to changes in the underlying interest rate of the hedged item. These hedged interest rate swaps are classified as fair value hedges. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Corporation terminated the outstanding fair value hedges. See Note 14 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation's fair value hedges. 

In addition, the Corporation offers interest rate-related instruments (swaps and caps) to service its customers&#8217; needs, for which the Corporation simultaneously enters into offsetting derivative financial instruments (i.e., mirror interest rate-related instruments) with third parties to manage its interest rate risk associated with these financial instruments. The valuation of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative and also includes a nonperformance / credit risk component (credit valuation adjustment). See Note 14 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s interest rate-related instruments. 

The discounted cash flow analysis component in the fair value measurement reflects the contractual terms of the derivative financial instruments, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. More specifically, the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) with the variable cash payments (or receipts) based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. Likewise, the fair values of interest rate options (i.e., interest rate caps) are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates fall below (or rise above) the strike rate of the floors (or caps), with the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the floor (or cap) based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. 

The Corporation also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative financial instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Corporation has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

While the Corporation has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate-related derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Corporation has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the fair value measures of its derivative financial instruments in their entirety are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Foreign Currency Exchange Forwards): The Corporation provides foreign currency exchange services to customers. In addition, the Corporation may enter into a foreign currency exchange forward to mitigate the exchange rate risk attached to the cash flows of a loan or as an offsetting contract to a forward entered into as a service to its customer. The valuation of the Corporation&#8217;s foreign currency exchange forwards is determined using quoted prices of foreign currency exchange forwards with similar characteristics, with consideration given to the nature of the quote and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the fair value estimate, and is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 14 for additional disclosures regarding the Corporation&#8217;s foreign currency exchange forwards. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Commodity Contracts): The Corporation enters into commodity contracts to manage commercial customers' exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, for which the Corporation simultaneously enters into offsetting derivative financial instruments (i.e., mirror commodity contracts) with third parties to manage its risk associated 

with these financial instruments. The valuation of the Corporation&#8217;s commodity contracts is determined using quoted prices of the underlying instruments, and also includes a nonperformance / credit risk component (credit valuation adjustment). See Note 14 for additional disclosures regarding the Corporation&#8217;s commodity contracts. 

The Corporation also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative financial instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Corporation has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings. 

While the Corporation has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as probability of default and loss given default of the underlying loans to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Corporation has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the fair value measures of its derivative financial instruments in their entirety are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below presents a rollforward of the consolidated balance sheets amounts for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, for financial instruments measured on a recurring basis and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) Derivative Financial Instruments Balance December 31, 2017 $ 1,225 &#160; &#160; Total net gains (losses) included in income Mortgage derivative gain (loss) ( 1,085 ) &#160; Balance December 31, 2018 $ 140 &#160; &#160; Total net gains (losses) included in income Mortgage derivative gain (loss) 1,681 &#160; &#160; Balance December 31, 2019 $ 1,817 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END

&#8232; For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019, the Corporation utilized the following valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs: 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Mortgage Derivative &#8212; Interest Rate Lock Commitments to Originate Residential Mortgage Loans Held For Sale): The fair value is determined by the change in value from each loan's rate lock date to the expected rate lock expiration date based on the underlying loan attributes, estimated closing ratios, and investor price matrix determined to be reasonably applicable to each loan commitment. The closing ratio calculation takes into consideration historical experience and loan-level attributes, particularly the change in the current interest rates from the time of initial rate lock. The closing ratio is periodically reviewed for reasonableness and reported to the Associated Mortgage Risk Management Committee. At December 31, 2019, the closing ratio was 86 %. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Mortgage Derivative&#8212;Forward Commitments to Sell Mortgage Loans): Mortgage derivatives include forward commitments to deliver closed-end residential mortgage loans into conforming Agency MBS or conforming Cash Forward sales. The fair value of such instruments is determined by the difference of current market prices for such traded instruments or available from forward cash delivery commitments and the original traded price for such commitments. 

The Corporation also relies on an internal valuation model to estimate the fair value of its forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans (i.e., an estimate of what the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate the forward delivery contract based on market prices for similar financial instruments), which includes matching specific terms and maturities of the forward commitments against applicable investor pricing available. While there are Level 2 and 3 inputs used in the valuation models, the Corporation has determined that the majority of the inputs significant in the valuation of both of the mortgage derivatives fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 14 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s mortgage derivatives. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Corporation&#8217;s more significant instruments measured on a nonrecurring basis at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Commercial Loans Held For Sale: Commercial loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, which the Corporation classifies as a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 

OREO: Certain OREO, upon initial recognition, was re-measured and reported at fair value through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated fair value of the OREO, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of OREO, upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment, was estimated using appraised values, which the Corporation classifies as a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 

For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2019, the Corporation utilized the following valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs. 

Impaired Loans: The Corporation considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement, including both principal and interest. Management has determined that commercial and consumer loan relationships that have nonaccrual status or have had their terms restructured in a troubled debt restructuring meet this impaired loan definition. For individually evaluated impaired loans, the amount of impairment is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans, or the estimated liquidity of the note. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the Corporation&#8217;s impaired loans. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights: MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available to allow for a &#8220;quoted price for similar assets&#8221; comparison. Accordingly, the Corporation utilizes an independent valuation from a third party which uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its MSRs. The valuation model incorporates prepayment assumptions to project MSRs cash flows based on the current interest rate scenario, which is then discounted to estimate an expected fair value of the MSRs. The valuation model considers portfolio characteristics of the underlying mortgages, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, discount rate assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service, and other economic factors. The Corporation periodically reviews and assesses the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the model. In addition, the Corporation compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data for MSRs, where available, and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation uses the amortization method (i.e., lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value measured on a nonrecurring basis), not fair value measurement accounting, for its MSRs assets. 

The discounted cash flow analyses that generate expected market prices utilize the observable characteristics of the MSRs portfolio, as well as certain unobservable valuation parameters. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation&#8217;s MSRs are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 

These parameter assumptions fall within a range that the Corporation, in consultation with an independent third party, believes purchasers of servicing would apply to such portfolios sold into the current secondary servicing market. Discussions are held with members from Treasury and the Community, Consumer, and Business segment to reconcile the fair value estimates and the key assumptions used by the respective parties in arriving at those estimates. The Associated Mortgage Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing control over the valuation methodology and key assumptions. To assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement, the Corporation also compares the fair value and constant prepayment rate to a value calculated by an independent third party on an annual basis. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s MSRs. 

Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values: The Corporation measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. Included in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are 77,000 Visa Class B restricted shares carried at fair value. These shares are currently subject to certain transfer restrictions and will be convertible into Visa Class A shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. Based on the current conversion factor, the Corporation expects 77,000 shares of Visa Class B to convert to 124,956 shares of Visa Class A upon the litigation resolution. 

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Corporation will adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Corporation's estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities and other adjustments. See Note 3 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s equity securities without readily determinable fair values. 

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of December 31, 2019 that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable. Also shown are the cumulative upward and downward adjustments for the Corporation's equity securities without readily determinable fair values as of December 31, 2019:

Note 19 Regulatory Matters 

Restrictions on Cash and Due From Banks 

The Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiary is required to maintain certain vault cash and reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank to meet specific reserve requirements. These requirements approximated $ 189 million at December 31, 2019. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

The Corporation and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Corporation&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off- 

balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Corporation&#8217;s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, that the Corporation meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

For additional information on the capital requirements applicable for the Corporation and the Bank, please see Part I, Item 1. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the most recent notifications from the OCC and the FDIC categorized the subsidiary bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the subsidiary bank must maintain minimum ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution&#8217;s category. The actual capital amounts and ratios of the Corporation and its significant subsidiary are presented below. No deductions from capital were made for interest rate risk in 2019 or 2018.

Note 21 Segment Reporting 

The Corporation utilizes a risk-based internal profitability measurement system to provide strategic business unit reporting. The profitability measurement system is based on internal management methodologies designed to produce consistent results and reflect the underlying economics of the units. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The three reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer, and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services. The financial information of the Corporation&#8217;s segments has been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in Note 1, with certain exceptions. The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. 

The reportable segment results are presented based on the Corporation's internal management accounting process. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to U.S. GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in previously reported segment financial data. Additionally, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 

To determine financial performance of each segment, the Corporation allocates FTP assignments, the provision for credit losses, certain noninterest expenses, income tax, and equity to each segment. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic 

adjustment as the internal management accounting system is revised, the interest rate environment evolves, and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically reviewed. 

The Corporation allocates net interest income using an internal FTP methodology that charges users of funds (assets) and credits providers of funds (liabilities, primarily deposits) based on the maturity, prepayment, and / or re-pricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of this allocation is offset in the Risk Management and Shared Services segment to ensure the consolidated total reflects the Corporation's net interest income. The net FTP allocation is reflected as net intersegment interest income (expense) in the accompanying tables. 

A credit provision is allocated to segments based on the expected long-term annual net charge off rates attributable to the credit risk of loans managed by the segment during the period. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is determined based on an incurred loss model using the methodologies described in Note 1 to assess the overall appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The net effect of the credit provision is recorded in Risk Management and Shared Services. Indirect expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bank-wide expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the Corporation&#8217;s estimated effective tax rate, with certain segments adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses, the net tax residual is recorded in Risk Management and Shared Services. Equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk). 

A description of each business segment is presented below. 

Corporate and Commercial Specialty: The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment serves a wide range of customers including larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions. In serving this segment we compete based on an in-depth understanding of our customers&#8217; financial needs, the ability to match market competitive solutions to those needs, and the highest standards of relationship and service excellence in the delivery of these services.

Risk Management and Shared Services: The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes Corporate Risk Management, Credit Administration, Finance, Treasury, Operations and Technology, which are key shared functions. The segment also includes Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations and residual revenue and expenses, representing the difference between actual amounts incurred and the amounts allocated to operating segments, including interest rate risk residuals (FTP mismatches) and credit risk and provision residuals (long term credit charge mismatches). The earning assets within this segment include the Corporation&#8217;s investment portfolio, and capital includes both allocated and any remaining unallocated capital.

Below is a listing of performance obligations for the Corporation's main revenue streams: 

##TABLE_START Revenue Stream Noninterest income in-scope of Topic 606 Insurance commissions and fees The Corporation's insurance revenue has two distinct performance obligations. The first performance obligation is the selling of the policy as an agent for the carrier. This performance obligation is satisfied upon binding of the policy. The second performance obligation is the ongoing servicing of the policy which is satisfied over the life of the policy. For employee benefits, the payment is typically received monthly. For property and casualty, payments can vary, but are typically received at, or in advance, of the policy period. Service charges and deposit account fees Service charges on deposit accounts consist of monthly service fees (i.e. business analysis fees and consumer service charges) and other deposit account related fees. The Corporation's performance obligation for monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. Other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Corporation's performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to the customers&#8217; accounts. 

Card-based fees (a) 

Card-based fees are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, ATM fees, and merchant services income. Debit and credit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Corporation's debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks. ATM and merchant fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Corporation's performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month. 

Trust and asset management fees (b) 

Trust and asset management income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets. The Corporation's performance obligation is generally satisfied over time and the resulting fees are recognized monthly, based upon the month-end market value of the assets under management and the applicable fee rate. Payment is generally received a few days after month end through a direct charge to the customers&#8217; accounts. The Corporation's performance obligation for these transactional-based services is generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time (i.e., as incurred). Payment is received shortly after services are rendered. 

Brokerage and advisory fees (b) 

Brokerage and advisory fees primarily consists of investment advisory, brokerage, retirement services, and annuities. The Corporation's performance obligation for investment advisory services and retirement services is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the services are provided. The performance obligation for annuities is satisfied upon sale of the annuity, and therefore, the related revenue is primarily recognized at the time of sale. Payment for these services are typically received immediately or in advance of the service. ##TABLE_END

(a) Certain card-based fees are out-of-scope of Topic 606. 

(b) Trust and asset management fees and brokerage and advisory fees are included in wealth management fees. 

Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations 

The Corporation's contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the expected cost plus margin.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

Associated Banc-Corp: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Associated Banc-Corp and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 11, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Assessment of the allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment (ALL) was $185.2 million of a total allowance for loan losses of $201.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company estimated the ALL using a historical loss methodology that estimates the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD), which are based on loan grades for commercial loans and credit reports for consumer loans. Such amounts are adjusted for qualitative factors. 

We identified the assessment of the ALL as a critical audit matter because it involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment, and knowledge and experience in the industry. The assessment of the ALL encompassed the evaluation of the ALL methodology, including the methodologies used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and their key factors and assumptions, including the loan grades for commercial loans, credit reports for consumer loans, the historical loan loss and delinquency experience, the loss emergence periods, and how loans with similar risk characteristics are segmented and (2) the qualitative factors. The assessment also included an evaluation of the mathematical accuracy of certain ALL calculations. 

The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's ALL process, including controls related to the (1) development and approval of the ALL methodology, (2) determination of the key factors and assumptions used to estimate the PD and LGD including the loan grades for commercial loans, credit reports for consumer loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, how loans with similar risk characteristics are segmented, and the loss emergence periods, (3) development of the qualitative factors, and (4) calculation of the ALL. We evaluated the Company's process to develop the ALL by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions, and tested the mathematical accuracy of certain calculations of the ALL. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized industry knowledge and experience, who assisted in: 

&#8226; evaluating the Company's ALL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, 

&#8226; evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used to develop the key assumptions for the PD and LGD including loan grades for commercial loans, credit reports for consumer loans, and the historical loan loss and delinquency experience, 

&#8226; evaluating the methodology used to develop the loss emergence periods, 

&#8226; determining whether loans were segmented by similar risk characteristics, 

&#8226; evaluating the methodology used to develop the resulting qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the ALL, and 

&#8226; evaluating individual loan grades for a selection of commercial loan relationships.
