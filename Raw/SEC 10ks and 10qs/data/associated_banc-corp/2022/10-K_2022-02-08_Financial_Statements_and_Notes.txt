Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 

Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to U.S. GAAP and to general practice within the financial services industry. The following is a description of the more significant of those policies. 

Business 

Associated Banc-Corp is a bank holding company headquartered in Wisconsin. The Corporation provides a full range of banking and related financial services to consumer and commercial customers through its network of bank and nonbank subsidiaries. The Corporation is subject to competition from other financial and non-financial institutions that offer similar or competing products and services. The Corporation is regulated by federal and state agencies and is subject to periodic examinations by those agencies. 

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated entities (none of which are considered to be variable interest entities in which the Corporation is the primary beneficiary) are accounted for using the cost method of accounting when the Corporation has determined that the cost method is appropriate. Investments not meeting the criteria for cost method accounting are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in unconsolidated entities are included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, and the Corporation&#8217;s share of income or loss is recorded in other noninterest income, while distributions in excess of the investment are recorded in asset gains, net. 

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACLL and MSRs valuation. Management has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 

Business Combinations 

The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase accounting method. Purchase accounting requires the total purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain intangible assets that must be recognized. Typically, this allocation results in the purchase price exceeding the fair value of net assets acquired, which is recorded as goodwill. CDIs are a measure of the value of checking, money market and savings deposits acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. CDIs and other identified intangibles with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years. 

Fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. 

For PCD loans, the credit discount includes estimated future credit losses expected over the life of the loan. The credit discount is recorded through a gross up of the allowance for loan loss and the corresponding loan. Adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are made through the provision for credit losses after the date of acquisition. 

Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including credit, interest, and liquidity discounts. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. There is no gross up to the allowance for loan loss and the corresponding loan, but instead provision for credit losses is recorded against the allowance for loan loss. See Note 2 for additional information on the Corporation's acquisitions. 

Investment Securities 

Securities are classified as HTM, AFS, or equity on the consolidated balance sheets at the time of purchase. Investment securities classified as HTM, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as AFS, which management has the intent and ability to hold for an indefinite 

period of time, but not necessarily to maturity, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in stockholders&#8217; equity as a separate component of OCI. Investment securities classified as equity securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value immediately reflected in the consolidated statements of income. Any decision to sell AFS securities would be based on various factors, including, but not limited to, asset / liability management strategies, changes in interest rates or prepayment risks, liquidity needs, or regulatory capital considerations. Realized gains or losses on investment security sales (using specific identification method) are included in investment securities gains (losses), net, on the consolidated statements of income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the estimated life (earlier of call date, maturity, or estimated life) of the related security, using a prospective method that approximates level yield. 

In certain situations, management may elect to transfer certain investment securities from the AFS classification to the HTM classification. In such cases, the investment securities are reclassified at fair value at the time of transfer. Any unrealized gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of transfer is retained therein and amortized over the remaining life of the investment security as an adjustment to yield. 

Management measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type. Accrued interest receivable on HTM securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts and is included in investment securities HTM, net, at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. 

For AFS securities, the Corporation evaluates whether any decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses on investments is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses on investments is recognized in OCI. 

Changes in the allowance for credit losses on investments are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the AFS security is uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. See Note 3 for additional information on investment securities. 

FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank Stocks 

The Corporation is required to maintain Federal Reserve Bank stock and FHLB stock as a member of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, and in amounts as required by these institutions. These equity securities are &#8220;restricted&#8221; in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other marketable equity securities and their fair value is equal to amortized cost. See Note 3 for additional information on the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank Stocks. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Residential Loans Held for Sale: Residential loans held for sale, which consist generally of current production of certain fixed-rate, first-lien residential mortgage loans, are carried at estimated fair value. As a result of holding these loans at fair value, changes in the secondary market are reflected in earnings immediately, as opposed to being dependent upon the timing of sales. The estimated fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. 

Commercial Loans Held for Sale: Commercial loans held for sale are carried at LOCOM. The estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. 

Loans 

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at their outstanding principal balances, net of any deferred fees and costs on originated loans. Origination fee income received on loans and amounts representing the estimated direct costs of origination are deferred and amortized to interest income over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. An ACLL is established for estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. See Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans below for further policy discussion. See Note 4 for additional information on loans. 

Nonaccrual Loans: Management considers a loan to be nonaccrual when it believes it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement, including both principal and interest. 

Interest income on loans is based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method. The accrual of interest income for commercial loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrower&#8217;s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, while the accrual of interest income for consumer loans is discontinued when loans reach specific delinquency levels. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, it is management&#8217;s practice to place such loans on a nonaccrual status immediately, rather than delaying such action until the loans become 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed, amortization of related deferred loan fees or costs is suspended, and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal and interest of the loan is collectible. If collectability of the principal and interest is in doubt, payments received are applied to loan principal. 

While a loan is in nonaccrual status, some or all of the cash interest payments received may be treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining recorded investment in the loan (i.e., after charge off of identified losses, if any) is deemed to be fully collectible. The determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan's remaining recorded investment must be supported by a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower&#8217;s sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors. A nonaccrual loan is returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, the borrower has demonstrated a period of sustained repayment performance, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. A sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months. See Note 4 for additional information on nonaccrual loans. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;Restructured Loans&#8221;) : Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. The concessions granted generally involve the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate, which generally would not otherwise be considered. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Nonaccrual restructured loans are included and treated with all other nonaccrual loans. In addition, all accruing restructured loans are reported as TDRs, which are individually analyzed by management. Generally, restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until the customer has attained a sustained period of repayment performance under the modified loan terms (generally a minimum of six months). However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and whether the loan should be returned to or maintained on accrual status. If the borrower&#8217;s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan remains on nonaccrual status. See Note 4 for additional information on restructured loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans: The Corporation adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. As a result, the allowance for loan losses is now a reserve for estimated lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The expected lifetime credit losses are the product of multiplying the Corporation's estimate of probability of default, loss given default, and the individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. The Corporation estimates the lifetime expected loss using prepayment assumptions over the projected lifetime cash flow of these loans. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. A provision for credit losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management&#8217;s judgment, is appropriate to absorb the expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio. 

The methodology applied by the Corporation is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses within the Corporation's loan segmentation. The methodology also focuses on evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio using a dual risk rating system consisting of probability of default and loss given default models, which are based on loan grades for commercial loans and credit reports for consumer loans applied based on portfolio segmentation leveraging industry breakouts in commercial and industrial and property types in CRE for commercial loans and loan types for consumer loans, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 

The Corporation utilizes the Moody's Baseline economic forecast in the allowance model and applies that forecast over a reasonable and supportable period with reversion to historical losses. For additional detail on the reasonable and supportable period and reversion inputs, see Note 4. The Corporation estimates the lifetime expected loss using prepayment assumptions over the projected lifetime cash flows of the loan. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. 

Management individually analyzes loans that do not share similar risk characteristics to other loans in the portfolio. Management has determined that commercial loan relationships that have nonaccrual status or commercial and retail loans that have had their terms restructured in a TDR meet this definition. Probable TDRs are loans the Corporation has reviewed individually to determine whether there is a high likelihood that the loans will default and will require restructuring in the near future. Probable TDRs could be classified as Pass, Special Mention, Potential Problem or Nonaccrual within the Corporation's credit quality analysis depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the individual credits. Accrued interest receivable on loans is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The ACLL attributable to the loan is allocated based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flows, as well as evaluation of legal options available to the Corporation. The amount of expected loan loss is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the fair value of the underlying collateral less applicable selling costs, or the observable market price of the loan. If foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, impairment is measured using the fair value of the loan&#8217;s collateral, less costs to sell. Large groups of homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, auto, and other consumer, are collectively evaluated for impairment. 

The allowance for unfunded commitments leverages the same methodology utilized to measure the allowance for loan losses. The Corporation estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Corporation is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Corporation. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. See Note 4 for additional information on the ACLL and Note 16 for additional information on the allowance for unfunded commitments. 

A portion of the ACLL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model. 

Management believes that the level of the ACLL is appropriate. While management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the ACLL may be necessary based on newly received appraisals, updated commercial customer financial statements, rapidly deteriorating cash flow, and changes in economic conditions that affect our customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation&#8217;s ACLL. Such agencies may require additions to the ACLL or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See Loans above for further policy discussion and see Note 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses. 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the allowance for loan loss was recorded at a level deemed by management to be able to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Under this incurred loss methodology several factors were evaluated including, but not limited to ongoing loan grading, historical loan losses and delinquency experience, and other qualitative factors. 

OREO 

OREO is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is comprised of property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and loans classified as in-substance foreclosure. OREO is recorded at the fair value of the underlying property collateral, less estimated selling costs. This fair value becomes the new cost basis for the foreclosed asset. The initial write-down, if any, will be recorded as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair value, as well as gains and losses on disposition and revenues and expenses incurred in maintaining such properties, are expensed as incurred. OREO also includes bank premises formerly but no longer used for banking, property originally acquired for future expansion but no longer intended to be used for that purpose, and property currently held for sale. Banking premises are transferred at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less estimated selling costs and any write-down is expensed as incurred. 

Premises and Equipment and Software 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term. Maintenance and 

repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while additions or major improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms, including extension options which the Corporation has determined are reasonably certain to be exercised, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Software, included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the contract terms or the estimated useful life of the software. See Note 6 for additional information on premises and equipment. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired consists primarily of goodwill and CDIs. CDIs have estimated finite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis to expense over a 10 -year period. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge would be recorded. 

Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit. An initial qualitative evaluation is made to assess the likelihood of impairment and determine whether further quantitative testing to calculate the fair value is necessary. When the qualitative evaluation indicates that impairment is more likely than not, quantitative testing is required whereby the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to the recorded book value, &#8220;step one.&#8221; If the calculated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value, an impairment charge is assessed, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. See Note 5 for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights : The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically retains the right to service the loans sold. Upon sale, a MSRs asset is capitalized, which represents the then current fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. MSRs, when purchased, are initially recorded at fair value. As the Corporation has not elected to subsequently measure any class of servicing assets under the fair value measurement method, the Corporation follows the amortization method. MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income, and assessed for impairment at each reporting date. MSRs are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Corporation periodically evaluates its MSRs asset for impairment. Impairment is assessed based on fair value at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans (predominantly loan type and note interest rate). As mortgage interest rates fall, prepayment speeds are usually faster and the value of the MSRs asset generally decreases, requiring additional valuation reserve. Conversely, as mortgage interest rates rise, prepayment speeds are usually slower and the value of the MSRs asset generally increases, requiring less valuation reserve. A valuation allowance is established, through a charge to earnings, to the extent the amortized cost of the MSRs exceeds the estimated fair value by stratification. If it is later determined that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a stratification, the valuation is reduced through a recovery to earnings. An other-than-temporary impairment (i.e., recoverability is considered remote when considering interest rates and loan pay off activity) is recognized as a write-down of the MSRs asset and the related valuation allowance (to the extent a valuation allowance is available) and then against earnings. A direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSRs asset and valuation allowance, precluding subsequent recoveries. See Note 5 for additional information on MSRs. 

Income Taxes 

Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In assessing the realizability of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies which will create taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the amount of taxes paid in available carryback years, projected future taxable income, and, if necessary, tax planning strategies in making this assessment. 

The Corporation files a consolidated federal income tax return and separate or combined state income tax returns. Accordingly, amounts equal to tax benefits of those subsidiaries having taxable federal or state losses or credits are offset by other subsidiaries that incur federal or state tax liabilities. 

It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to provide for uncertainty in income taxes as a part of income tax expense based upon management&#8217;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the Corporation prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit was established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability established, the Corporation&#8217;s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. See Note 13 for additional information on income taxes. 

Derivative and Hedging Activities 

Derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value recorded to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income, as appropriate. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Corporation designates the derivative as a fair value hedge (i.e., a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability), a cash flow hedge (i.e., a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability), or a free-standing derivative instrument. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability are recognized in current period earnings as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the hedged item on the balance sheet and in the related income statement account. Amounts within accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. For a derivative designated as a free-standing derivative instrument, changes in fair value are reported in capital markets, net on the consolidated statements of income. The free-standing derivative instruments included: interest rate risk management, commodity hedging, and foreign currency exchange solutions. 

The Corporation is exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The Corporation uses master netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in derivative transactions. To the extent the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements, the Corporation takes into account the impact of master netting arrangements that allow the Corporation to settle all derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. 

Federal regulations require the Corporation to clear all LIBOR interest rate swaps through a clearing house, if possible. For derivatives cleared through central clearing houses, the variation margin payments are legally characterized as daily settlements of the derivative rather than collateral. The Corporation's clearing agent for interest rate derivative contracts that are centrally cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Clearing House (LCH) settles the variation margin daily. As a result, the variation margin payment and the related derivative instruments are considered a single unit of account for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Depending on the net position, the fair value is reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The daily settlement of the derivative exposure does not change or reset the contractual terms of the instrument. See Note 14 for additional information on derivatives and hedging activities. 

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase 

The Corporation enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Corporation may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Corporation to repurchase the assets. These repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Corporation be in default (e.g., fails to make an interest payment to the counterparty) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities (i.e., there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities). The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability within federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. See Note 9 for additional information on repurchase agreements. 

Retirement Plans 

The funded status of the retirement plans is recognized as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in that funded status are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through OCI. Plan assets and benefit obligations are 

measured as of fiscal year end. The measurement of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense involve actuarial valuation methods and the use of various actuarial and economic assumptions. The Corporation monitors the assumptions and updates them periodically. Due to the long-term nature of the pension plan obligation, actual results may differ significantly from estimations. Such differences are adjusted over time as the assumptions are replaced by facts and values are recalculated. See Note 12 for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s retirement plans. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The fair value of restricted common stock awards is their fair market value on the date of grant. Performance awards are based on performance goals of earnings per share and total shareholder return with vesting ranging from a minimum of 0 % to a maximum of 150 % of the target award. Performance awards are valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of the awards at the grant date. The fair values of stock options and restricted stock awards are amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. Expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards are fully recognized on the date the colleague meets the definition of normal or early retirement. Compensation expense recognized is included in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 11 for additional information on stock-based compensation. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders&#8217; equity during a period, except those resulting from transactions with stockholders. In addition to net income, other components of the Corporation&#8217;s comprehensive income include the after tax effect of changes in net unrealized gain / loss on AFS securities and changes in net actuarial gain / loss on defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Comprehensive income is reported on the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholder&#8217;s equity and consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See Note 22 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value represents the estimated price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price concept). As there is no active market for many of the Corporation&#8217;s financial instruments, estimates are made using discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques. Inputs into the valuation methods are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, the derived fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Corporation could realize in a current market exchange. Assets and liabilities are categorized into three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Corporation&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. See Note 18 for additional information on fair value measurements. Below is a brief description of each fair value level. 

Level 1 &#8212; Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access. 

Level 2 &#8212; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 

Level 3 &#8212; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity&#8217;s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are considered to include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Earnings per common share are calculated utilizing the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock awards (outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock awards) and common stock warrants. See Note 20 for additional information on earnings per common share.

Note 2 Acquisitions and Dispositions 

Acquisitions: 

The Corporation did not have any acquisitions during 2021. 

First Staunton Acquisition 

On February 14, 2020 , the Corporation completed its acquisition of First Staunton . The purchase price was based on an assumed 4% deposit premium at announcement. The conversion of the branches was completed simultaneously with the close of the transaction, expanding the Bank's presence into nine new Metro-East St. Louis communities. As a result of the acquisition and other consolidations, a net of seven branch locations were added. 

The Corporation recorded $ 15 million in goodwill related to the First Staunton acquisition. Goodwill created by the acquisition is not tax deductible. 

The following table presents the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date related to the First Staunton acquisition:

For a description of methods used to determine the fair value of significant assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet above, see Assumptions section of this Note. 

The Corporation has purchased loans with the First Staunton acquisition, for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination (PCD). The carrying amount of those loans is as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) February 14, 2020 Purchase price of loans at acquisition $ 77,221 &#160; Allowance for credit losses at acquisition 3,504 &#160; Non-credit (premium) at acquisition ( 951 ) Par value of acquired loans at acquisition $ 79,774 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

The Corporation acquired no PCD securities in connection with the acquisition. 

Assumptions: 

Investment Securities: The fair value of investments on the date of acquisition was determined utilizing an external third party broker opinion of the market value. 

Loans: Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan, amortization status, and current discount rates. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques. 

CDIs: This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships with deposit customers. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternative cost of funds, and the interest costs associated with customer deposits. The CDIs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. 

Time deposits: The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

FHLB borrowings: The fair values of FHLB advances are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 

Dispositions: 

2021: 

On March 1, 2021, the Corporation completed the sale of its wealth management subsidiary, Whitnell, to Rockefeller for a purchase price of $ 8 million. Associated reported a first quarter 2021 pre-tax gain of $ 2 million, included in asset gains, net on the consolidated statements of income, in conjunction with the sale. 

On February 26, 2021, the Bank completed the sale of one branch located in Monroe, Wisconsin to Summit Credit Union. Under the terms of the transaction, the Bank sold $ 31 million in total deposits and no loans. The Bank received an approximately 4 % purchase premium on deposits transferred. 

2020: 

On June 30, 2020, the Corporation completed the sale of ABRC to USI for $ 266 million in cash. Associated recorded a second quarter 2020 pre-tax book gain of $ 163 million in conjunction with the sale. 

On December 11, 2020, the Bank completed the sale of five branches in Peoria, IL to Morton Community Bank. Under the terms of the transaction, the Bank sold $ 180 million in total deposits and no loans. The Bank received a 4% purchase premium on deposits transferred. With the sale of these branches, the Bank exited the Peoria market. 

On December 11, 2020, the Bank closed on the sale of two branches in southwest Wisconsin to Royal Bank. Under the terms of the transaction, the Bank sold $ 53 million in total deposits and no loans. The Bank received a 4% purchase premium on deposits transferred in the Prairie du Chien and Richland Center branches.

During the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation sold $ 107 million of lower yielding FFELP student loan asset backed securities at a slight gain and reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding MBS. During the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation sold $ 51 million of lower yielding U.S. Treasury and Agency securities at a slight loss to take advantage of the steeper yield curve by reinvesting the proceeds into similar but higher yielding, longer duration securities. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation sold $ 261 million of less liquid securities at a gain of $ 3 million, reinvesting the proceeds into more liquid securities in order to further improve portfolio liquidity. During the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation sold $ 281 million of primarily prepayment sensitive mortgage-related securities at a gain of $ 6 million. Additionally, in February 2020, the Corporation sold $ 84 million of certain securities acquired in the First Staunton acquisition that did not fit the parameters of the Corporation's current investment strategy . 

During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a one-time election to transfer municipal securities with an amortized cost of $ 692 million from HTM to AFS, as permitted by the adoption of ASU 2019-04 during the quarter. The Corporation sold shorter duration, lower yielding municipal securities that were included in the transfer for proceeds of $ 157 million at a gain of $ 3 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Corporation sold $ 1.2 billion of taxable, floating rate asset backed securities and shorter duration MBS, CMBS, and CMOs Agency securities. The proceeds from both sales were utilized to pay down borrowings and to reinvest into higher yielding securities with slightly longer durations, repositioning the portfolio for a declining rate environment. 

The Corporation also donated 42,039 shares of Visa Class B restricted shares to the Corporation's Charitable Remainder Trust during the second quarter of 2019, and the subsequent sale of those shares by the Trust resulted in an observable market price. 

As a result, the Corporation wrote up its remaining 77,000 Visa Class B restricted shares to fair value. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of covered litigation, the shares were previously carried at a zero cost basis. 

Investment securities with a carrying value of $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, were pledged to secure certain deposits or for other purposes. 

Accrued interest receivable on HTM securities totaled $ 15 million and $ 14 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accrued interest receivable on AFS securities totaled $ 9 million and $ 8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accrued interest receivable on both HTM and AFS securities is included in interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. There was no interest income reversed for investments going into nonaccrual at December 31, 2021 or 2020. 

A security is considered past due once it is 30 days past due under the terms of the agreement. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had no past due HTM securities. 

The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was approximately $ 55 ,000 and $ 67 ,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, attributable entirely to the Corporation's municipal securities, included in investment securities HTM, net, at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation also holds U.S. Treasury, municipal and mortgage-related securities issued by the U.S. government or a GSE which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and, as a result, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded related to these securities. 

The following represents gross unrealized losses and the related fair value of AFS and HTM securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2021:

The Corporation reviews the AFS investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to monitor its credit exposure. A determination as to whether a security&#8217;s decline in fair value is the result of credit risk takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Some factors the Corporation may consider in this impairment analysis include the extent to which the security has been in an unrealized loss position, the change in security rating, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as security and industry specific economic conditions. 

Based on the Corporation&#8217;s evaluation, management does not believe any unrealized losses at December 31, 2021 represent credit deterioration as these unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and the current market conditions. The U.S. Treasury 3 year and 5 year rates increased by 80 bp and 90 bp, respectively, from December 31, 2020. The Corporation does not intend to sell nor does it believe that it will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank Stocks: The Corporation is required to maintain Federal Reserve Bank stock and FHLB stock as a member bank of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, and in amounts as required by these institutions. These equity securities are &#8220;restricted&#8221; in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other marketable equity securities and their fair value is equal to amortized cost. The Corporation had FHLB stock of $ 82 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Corporation had Federal Reserve Bank stock of $ 87 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Accrued interest receivable on FHLB stock totaled approximately $ 975 ,000 and $ 972 ,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There was no accrued interest receivable on Federal Reserve Bank stock at either December 31, 2021 or 2020. Accrued interest receivable on both FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock is included in interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Equity Securities 

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values: The Corporation's portfolio of equity securities with readily determinable fair values is primarily comprised of CRA Qualified Investment mutual funds and other mutual funds. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $ 5 million and $ 2 million, respectively. 

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values: The Corporation's portfolio of equity securities without readily determinable fair values primarily consists of 77,996 Visa Class B restricted shares, 77,000 of which the Corporation received in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering and carried at fair value after the Corporation donated 42,039 Visa Class B restricted shares to the Corporation's Charitable Remainder Trust during the second quarter of 2019, with the subsequent sale of those shares resulting in an observable market price after the shares were previously carried at a zero cost basis. During the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation acquired 996 Visa Class B restricted shares in the acquisition of First Staunton, and those shares are carried at a zero cost basis due to the lack of an observable market price since the time of acquisition. The Corporation had equity securities without readily determinable fair values of $ 14 million and $ 13 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(a) Revolving loans converted to term loans are also reported in their year of origination. 

(b) The Corporation&#8217;s policy is to assign risk ratings at the borrower level. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and therefore the Corporation considers these loans to have a risk profile similar to pass rated loans. 

(c) Includes asset-based lending. 

(d) Accruing TDRs are included in pass unless otherwise rated as special mention. 

The following table presents commercial and consumer loans by credit quality indicator by vintage year at December 31, 2020:

(a) Revolving loans converted to term loans are also reported in their year of origination. 

(b) The Corporation&#8217;s policy is to assign risk ratings at the borrower level. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and therefore the Corporation considers these loans to have a risk profile similar to pass rated loans. 

(c) Includes asset-based lending. 

(d) Includes auto. 

(e) Accruing TDRs are included in pass unless otherwise rated as special mention. 

Factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, and appropriate policies for allowance for loan losses, allowance for unfunded commitments, nonaccrual loans, and charge offs. See Note 1 for the Corporation's accounting policy for loans. 

For commercial loans, management has determined the pass credit quality indicator to include credits that exhibit acceptable financial statements, cash flow, and leverage. If any risk exists, it is mitigated by the loan structure, collateral, monitoring, or control. For consumer loans, performing loans include credits performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. 

Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Special mention credits have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit. Potential problem loans are considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged. These loans generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which may jeopardize liquidation of the debt, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Management has determined commercial loan relationships in nonaccrual status, and commercial and consumer loan relationships with their terms restructured in a TDR, meet the criteria to be individually evaluated. Commercial loans classified as special mention, potential problem, and nonaccrual are reviewed at a minimum on a quarterly basis, while pass credits, which are performing rated credits, are generally reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if the loan renewal is less than one year or if otherwise warranted.

All loans modified in a TDR are individually evaluated for impairment. The nature and extent of the impairment of restructured loans, including those which have experienced a subsequent payment default, are considered in the determination of an appropriate level of the ACLL. 

The Corporation analyzes loans for classification as a probable TDR. This analysis includes identifying customers that are showing possible liquidity issues in the near term without reasonable access to alternative sources of capital. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had a single $ 7 million oil &#38; gas loan that met this classification, compared to $ 68 million at December 31, 2020. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

The ACLL is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The level of the ACLL represents management&#8217;s estimate of an amount appropriate to provide for expected lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The expected lifetime credit losses are the product of multiplying the Corporation's estimates of probability of default, loss given default, and the individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. A main factor in the determination of the ACLL is the economic forecast. The Corporation utilized Moody's baseline forecast, updated during December 2021, in the allowance model. The forecast is applied over a 2 year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to the historical losses over the second year of the period. See Note 1 for the Corporation's accounting policy on the ACLL. The allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb expected lifetime losses related to unfunded credit facilities (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit). See Note 16 for additional information on the change in the allowance for unfunded commitments. 

The following table presents a summary of the changes in the ACLL by portfolio segment for the year ended December 31, 2021:

Loans Acquired in Acquisitions 

Loans acquired in a business combination after January 1, 2020 are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 326. See Note 2 for more information on loans acquired in a business combination. After January 1, 2020, acquired loans were segregated into two types: 

&#8226; Non-PCD loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 310-20 "Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs" as these loans do not show evidence of credit deterioration since origination. The allowance for loan losses on these loans is recorded through provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income at acquisition. 

&#8226; PCD loans are loans demonstrating more than insignificant credit deterioration and are accounted for with ASC Topic 326-30. Under this guidance, the credit mark on acquired assets grosses up the ACLL and the amortized cost of the loan. 

Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is not amortized but is instead subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets. 

The Corporation conducted its most recent annual impairment testing in May 2021, utilizing a qualitative assessment. Factors that management considered in this assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the Corporation and each reporting unit (both current and projected), changes in management strategy, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets. In addition, management considered the changes in both the Corporation's common stock price and in the overall bank common stock index (based on the S&#38;P 400 Regional Bank Sub-Industry Index), as well as the Corporation's earnings per common share trend over the past year. Based on the these assessments, management concluded that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill) for each reporting unit. Therefore, a step one quantitative analysis was not required. There have been no events since the May 2021 impairment test that have changed the Corporation's impairment assessment conclusion. There were no impairment charges recorded in 2021, 2020, or 2019. 

The Corporation had goodwill of $ 1.1 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, there was a reduction of $ 82 million of goodwill related to the sale of ABRC. Throughout 2020, there was a net increase in goodwill related to the First Staunton acquisition of $ 15 million. During the first quarter of 2021, there was a reduction of $ 4 million of goodwill related to the sale of Whitnell. See Note 2 for additional information on the Corporation's acquisitions and dispositions. 

Other Intangible Assets 

The Corporation has other intangible assets that are amortized, consisting of CDIs and MSRs. For CDIs and other intangibles, changes in the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization, and net book value were as follows:

Mortgage Servicing Rights &#160; 

The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically retains the right to service the loans sold. MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assessed for impairment at each reporting date. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for MSRs. See Note 16 for a discussion of the recourse provisions on sold residential mortgage loans. See Note 18 which further discusses fair value measurement relative to the MSRs asset. 

A summary of changes in the balance of the MSRs asset and the MSRs valuation allowance is as follows:

Note 7 Leases 

The Corporation has operating leases for retail and corporate offices, land, and equipment. The Corporation also has finance leases for land and retail and corporate offices. 

These leases have original terms of 1 year or longer with remaining maturities up to 41 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term. An analysis of the lease options has been completed and any purchase options or optional periods that the Corporation is reasonably likely to extend have been included in the capitalization. 

The discount rate used to capitalize the operating leases is the Corporation's FHLB borrowing rate on the date of lease commencement. When determining the rate to discount specific lease obligations, the repayment period and term are considered. 

Operating and finance lease costs and cash flows resulting from these leases are presented below:

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase 

The Corporation enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Corporation may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Corporation to repurchase the assets. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts (i.e., there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities). 

The Corporation utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase to facilitate the needs of its customers. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation pledged agency mortgage-related securities with a fair value of $ 448 million as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Corporation's safekeeping agents and are monitored on a daily basis due to the market risk of fair value changes in the 

underlying securities. The Corporation generally pledges excess securities to ensure there is sufficient collateral to satisfy short-term fluctuations in both the repurchase agreement balances and the fair value of the underlying securities. 

The remaining contractual maturity of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following table:

Note 11 Stock-Based Compensation 

Stock-Based Compensation Plan 

In February 2020, the Board of Directors, with subsequent approval of the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders, approved the adoption of the 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan. All remaining shares available for grant under the 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan were rolled into the 2020 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 11.0 million shares remained available for grant under the 2020 Plan. 

Under the 2020 Plan, options are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant, have an exercise price that is equal to the closing price of the Corporation&#8217;s stock on the grant date, and vest ratably over four years . 

The Corporation also issues restricted stock awards under the 2020 Plan. The shares of restricted stock are restricted as to transfer, but are not restricted as to dividend payment or voting rights. Restricted stock units receive dividend equivalents but do not have voting rights. The transfer restrictions lapse over three years or four years , depending upon whether the awards are performance-based or service-based. Performance-based awards are based on earnings per share performance goals, relative total shareholder return, and continued employment or meeting the requirements for retirement and service-based awards are contingent upon continued employment or meeting the requirements for retirement. Performance-based restricted stock awards granted during 2020 and 2021 will cliff-vest after the three year performance period has ended. Service-based restricted stock awards granted during 2020 and 2021 will vest ratably over four years . 

The 2020 Plan provides that restricted stock awards and stock options will immediately become fully vested upon retirement from the Corporation of retirement eligible colleagues. See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for stock based compensation. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 

The fair values of stock options and restricted stock awards (including restricted stock units) are amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For retirement eligible colleagues, expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards are fully recognized on the date the colleague meets the definition of normal or early retirement. Compensation expense recognized is included in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of income. 

Performance awards are based on performance goals of earnings per share and total shareholder return with vesting ranging from a minimum of 0 % to a maximum of 150 % of the target award. Performance awards are valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of the awards at the grant date. 

Assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted. The weighted average expected life of the stock option represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated using historical data of stock option exercises and forfeitures. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of the Corporation&#8217;s stock. The Corporation did not grant stock options during 2021. 

The following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value for options granted in 2020 and 2019: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 Dividend yield 3.50 &#160; % 3.30 &#160; % Risk-free interest rate 1.60 &#160; % 2.60 &#160; % Weighted average expected volatility 21.00 &#160; % 24.00 &#160; % Weighted average expected life 5.75 years 5.75 years Weighted average per share fair value of options $ 2.39 $ 4.00 ##TABLE_END

The Corporation had $ 21 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock awards at December 31, 2021 that are expected to be recognized over the remaining requisite service periods that extend predominantly through first quarter 2025 . The Corporation has the ability to issue shares from treasury or new shares upon the exercise of stock options or the granting of restricted stock awards. 

As described in Note 10, the Board of Directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available for issuance in connection with the Corporation&#8217;s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes. The repurchase of shares will be based on market and investment opportunities, capital levels, growth prospects, and the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals. Such repurchases may occur from time to time in open market purchases, block transactions, private transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, or similar facilities. 

Note 12 Retirement Plans 

The Corporation has a noncontributory defined benefit RAP, covering substantially all employees who meet participation requirements. The benefits are based primarily on years of service and the employee&#8217;s compensation paid. Employees of acquired entities generally participate in the RAP after consummation of the business combinations. Any retirement plans of acquired entities are typically merged into the RAP after completion of the mergers, and credit is usually given to employees for years of service at the acquired institution for vesting and eligibility purposes. 

The Corporation also provides legacy healthcare access to a limited group of retired employees from a previous acquisition in the Postretirement Plan. There are no other active retiree healthcare plans. 

The First Staunton acquisition closed on February 14, 2020 , and the employees who met the required criteria became eligible to participate in the RAP on February 15, 2020 , with their vesting service credit based on their prior hours of service with First Staunton. See Note 2 for additional information on the First Staunton acquisition. 

The funded status and amounts recognized on the 2021 and 2020 consolidated balance sheets, as measured on December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the RAP and Postretirement Plan were as follows:

The expected long-term (more than 20 years) rate of return was estimated using market benchmarks for equities and bonds applied to the RAP&#8217;s anticipated asset allocations. The expected return on equities was computed utilizing a valuation framework, which projected future returns based on current equity valuations rather than historical returns. The actual rates of return for the RAP assets were 10.10 % and 15.18 % for 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The RAP&#8217;s investments are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risks associated with certain investments and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of the investments, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term could materially affect the amounts reported. The investment objective for the RAP is to maximize total return with a tolerance for average risk. The RAP has a diversified portfolio designed to provide liquidity, current income, and growth of income and principal, with anticipated asset allocation ranges of: equity securities 50 to 70 %, fixed-income securities 30 to 50 %, alternative securities 0 to 15 %, and other cash equivalents 0 to 10 %. Based on changes in economic and market conditions, the Corporation could be outside of the allocation ranges for brief 

periods of time. The asset allocation for the RAP as of the December 31, 2021 and 2020 measurement dates, respectively, by asset category were as follows: 

##TABLE_START Asset Category 2021 2020 Equity securities 55 &#160; % 53 &#160; % Fixed-income securities 34 &#160; % 33 &#160; % Group annuity contracts 10 &#160; % 11 &#160; % Alternative securities &#8212; &#160; % 1 &#160; % Other 1 &#160; % 2 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END 

The RAP assets include cash equivalents, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, common / collective trust funds (which include investments in equity and bond securities), and a group annuity contract. Money market accounts are stated at cost plus accrued interest, mutual funds are valued at quoted market prices, investments in common / collective trust funds are valued at the amount at which units in the funds can be withdrawn, and the group annuity contract is valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations and considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. 

Based on these inputs, the following table summarizes the fair value of the RAP&#8217;s investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

The Corporation&#8217;s funding policy is to pay at least the minimum amount required by federal law and regulations, with consideration given to the maximum funding amounts allowed. The Corporation regularly reviews the funding of its RAP. There were no contributions to the RAP during 2021 and 2020. 

The projected benefit payments were calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the benefit obligations listed above. The projected benefit payments for the RAP and Postretirement Plan at December 31, 2021, reflecting expected future services, were as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) RAP Postretirement Plan Estimated future benefit payments 2022 $ 16,398 &#160; $ 180 &#160; 2023 15,956 &#160; 175 &#160; 2024 16,897 &#160; 169 &#160; 2025 18,555 &#160; 163 &#160; 2026 17,051 &#160; 156 &#160; 2027-2031 77,883 &#160; 674 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The health care trend rate is an assumption as to how much the Postretirement Plan&#8217;s medical costs will change each year in the future. There are no remaining participants under age 65 in the Postretirement Plan. The actual change in 2021 health care premium rates for post-65 coverage was a decrease of 2.00 %. The health care trend rate assumption for post-65 coverage is an increase of 5.25 % in 2022 with the rate of increase slowing by 0.25 % to an ultimate rate of 5.00 % for 2023 and future years. 

The Corporation also has a 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the &#8220;401(k) plan&#8221;). The Corporation&#8217;s contribution is determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors. Total expenses related to contributions to the 401(k) plan were $ 13 million, $ 15 million, and $ 16 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

At December 31, 2020, the valuation allowance for DTAs of approximately $ 251 ,000 was related to the deferred tax benefit of specific federal tax loss carryforwards of $ 3 million from a 2017 acquisition. The changes in the valuation allowance related to net operating losses for 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) 2021 2020 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, beginning of year $ ( 251 ) $ ( 251 ) Decrease in current year 251 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, end of year $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 251 ) ##TABLE_END 

At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 79 million (of which $ 32 million was acquired from various acquisitions) that will begin expiring in 2031 . 

The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate. The major reasons for this difference were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 Federal income tax rate at statutory rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increases (decreases) resulting from: Tax-exempt interest and dividends ( 3.0 ) % ( 3.9 ) % ( 3.3 ) % State income taxes (net of federal benefit) 3.8 &#160; % 3.7 % 3.5 % Bank owned life insurance ( 0.6 ) % ( 0.9 ) % ( 0.8 ) % Tax effect of tax credits and benefits, net of related expenses ( 1.8 ) % ( 1.8 ) % ( 0.9 ) % Tax reserve adjustments / settlements &#8212; &#160; % 0.1 % 0.2 % Net tax (benefit) expense from stock-based compensation &#8212; &#160; % 0.3 % ( 0.2 ) % Restructuring in conjunction with ABRC sale ( 0.1 ) % ( 13.7 ) % &#8212; &#160; % FDIC premium 0.5 &#160; % 0.8 % 0.5 % Other ( 0.2 ) % 0.6 % ( 0.4 ) % Effective income tax rate 19.6 &#160; % 6.2 &#160; % 19.6 &#160; % ##TABLE_END

Savings banks acquired by the Corporation in 1997 and 2004 qualified under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that permitted them to deduct from taxable income an allowance for bad debts that differed from the provision for such losses charged to income for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made for $ 100 million of retained income at December 31, 2021. If income taxes had been provided, the deferred tax liability would have been approximately $ 25 million. Management does not expect this amount to become taxable in the future; therefore, no provision for income taxes has been made. 

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Corporation&#8217;s federal income tax returns are open and subject to examination from the 2018 tax return year and forward. The years open to examination by state and local government authorities varies by jurisdiction. 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as f ollows: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Millions) 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 3 &#160; $ 3 &#160; Subtractions for tax positions related to prior years ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of year $ 2 &#160; $ 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were $ 2 million and $ 3 million, respectively. 

The Corporation recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line on the consolidated statements of income. Interest and penalty benefits were negligible at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Accrued interest and penalties were negligible at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Management does not anticipate significant adjustments to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 

Note 14 Derivative and Hedging Activities 

The Corporation is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Corporation principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Corporation manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Corporation enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Corporation's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Corporation's known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Corporation's assets. 

The contract or notional amount of a derivative is used to determine, along with the other terms of the derivative, the amounts to be exchanged between the counterparties. The Corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments. To mitigate the counterparty risk, contracts generally contain language outlining collateral pledging requirements for each counterparty. For non-centrally cleared derivatives, collateral must be posted when the market value exceeds certain mutually agreed upon threshold limits. Securities and cash are often pledged as collateral. The Corporation pledged $ 71 million of investment securities as collateral at December 31, 2021, and pledged $ 72 million of investment securities as collateral at December 31, 2020. Cash is often pledged as collateral for derivatives that are not centrally 

cleared. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation posted $ 11 million cash collateral compared to $ 31 million at December 31, 2020. See Note 18 for fair value information and disclosures and see Note 1 for the Corporation's accounting policy for derivative and hedging activities. 

Derivatives to Accommodate Customer Needs 

The Corporation also facilitates customer borrowing activity by entering into various derivative contracts which are designated as free standing derivative contracts. Free standing derivative products are entered into primarily for the benefit of commercial customers seeking to manage their exposures to interest rate risk, foreign currency, and commodity prices. These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Such derivative contracts are carried at fair value in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value recorded as a component of capital markets, net, and typically include interest rate-related instruments (swaps and caps), foreign currency exchange forwards, and commodity contracts. See Note 15 for additional information and disclosures on balance sheet offsetting. 

Interest rate-related instruments: The Corporation provides interest rate risk management services to commercial customers, primarily forward interest rate swaps and caps. The Corporation&#8217;s market risk from unfavorable movements in interest rates related to these derivative contracts is generally economically hedged by concurrently entering into offsetting derivative contracts. The offsetting derivative contracts have identical notional values, terms, and indices. 

Foreign currency exchange forwards: The Corporation provides foreign currency exchange services to customers, primarily forward contracts. The Corporation's customers enter into a foreign currency exchange forward with the Corporation as a means for them to mitigate exchange rate risk. The Corporation mitigates its risk by then entering into an offsetting foreign currency exchange derivative contract. 

Commodity contracts: Commodity contracts are entered into primarily for the benefit of commercial customers seeking to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. The Corporation mitigates its risk by then entering into an offsetting commodity derivative contract. 

Mortgage Derivatives 

Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans are considered derivative instruments, and the fair value of these commitments is recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with the changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking, net on the consolidated statements of income. 

The following table presents the total notional amounts and gross fair values of the Corporation's derivatives, as well as the balance sheet netting adjustments as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, but after the variation margin payments with central clearing organizations have been applied as settlement, as applicable. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received or paid as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The resulting net derivative asset and liability fair values are included in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The table below identifies the balance sheet category and fair values of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative instruments:

The Corporation terminated its $ 500 million fair value hedge during the fourth quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2021, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios which had previously been used in the terminated hedging relationship was $ 414 million and is included in loans on the consolidated balance sheets. This amount includes $ 2 million of hedging adjustments on the discontinued hedging relationships.

Note 15 Balance Sheet Offsetting 

Interest Rate-Related Instruments, Commodity Contracts, and Foreign Exchange Forwards (&#8220;Interest, Commodity, and Foreign Exchange Agreements&#8221;) 

The Corporation enters into interest rate-related instruments to facilitate the interest rate risk management strategies of commercial customers, commodity contracts to manage commercial customers' exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, and foreign exchange forwards to manage customers' exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. The Corporation mitigates these risks by entering into equal and offsetting agreements with highly rated third-party financial institutions. The Corporation is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties that create single net settlements of all legal claims or obligations to pay or receive the net amount of settlement of the individual interest, commodity, and foreign exchange agreements. Collateral, usually in the form of investment securities and cash, is posted by the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds. Derivatives subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement are reported with assets and liabilities offset resulting in a net position which is further offset by any cash collateral, and is reported in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 14 for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s derivative and hedging activities. 

The following table presents the interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange assets and liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement. The interest, commodity and foreign exchange agreements the Corporation has with its commercial customers are not subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, and therefore, are excluded from this table:

Note 16 Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Legal Proceedings 

The Corporation utilizes a variety of financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to manage its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include lending-related and other commitments (see below) as well as derivative instruments (see Note 14). The following is a summary of lending-related commitments: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020

(a) These off-balance sheet financial instruments are exercisable at the market rate prevailing at the date the underlying transaction will be completed and, thus, are deemed to have no current fair value, or the fair value is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and was not material at December 31, 2021 or 2020. 

(b) Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale are considered derivative instruments and are disclosed in Note 14. 

(c) The Corporation has established a liability of $ 2 million and $ 3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as an estimate of the fair value of these financial instruments. 

Lending-related Commitments 

As a financial services provider, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the Corporation, with each customer&#8217;s creditworthiness evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The Corporation&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the customer. Since a significant portion of commitments to extend credit are subject to specific restrictive loan covenants or may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. An allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb expected lifetime losses related to unfunded commitments (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit). 

The following table presents a summary of the changes in the allowance for unfunded commitments: 

##TABLE_START ($ in Thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Allowance for Unfunded Commitments Balance at beginning of period $ 47,776 &#160; $ 21,907 &#160; Cumulative effect of ASU 2016-13 adoption (CECL) N/A 18,690 &#160; Balance at beginning of period, adjusted 47,776 &#160; 40,597 &#160; Provision for unfunded commitments ( 8,000 ) 7,000 &#160; Amount recorded at acquisition &#8212; &#160; 179 &#160; Balance at end of period $ 39,776 &#160; $ 47,776 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Lending-related commitments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers at predetermined interest rates, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans are considered derivative instruments, and the fair value of these commitments is recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation&#8217;s derivative and hedging activity is further described in Note 14. Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party, while standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party. 

Other Commitments 

The Corporation invests in qualified affordable housing projects, federal and state historic projects, new market projects, and opportunity zone funds for the purpose of community reinvestment and obtaining tax credits and other tax benefits. Return on the Corporation's investment in these projects and funds comes in the form of the tax credits and tax losses that pass through to the Corporation, and deferral or elimination of capital gain recognition for tax purposes. The aggregate carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2021, was $ 268 million, compared to $ 272 million at December 31, 2020, included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation utilizes the proportional amortization method to account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

Under the proportional amortization method, the Corporation amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits. The Corporation recognized additional income tax expense attributable to the amortization of investments in qualified affordable housing projects of $ 33 million, $ 23 million, and $ 19 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Corporation's remaining investment in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for under the proportional amortization method totaled $ 262 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 268 million at December 31, 2020. 

The Corporation&#8217;s unfunded equity contributions relating to investments in federal and state qualified affordable housing and federal and state historic projects are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation&#8217;s remaining unfunded equity contributions totaled $ 80 million and $ 118 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation did not record any impairment related to qualified affordable housing investments. 

The Corporation has principal investment commitments to provide capital-based financing to private companies through either direct investment in specific companies or through investment funds and partnerships. The timing of future cash requirements to fund such principal investment commitments is generally dependent on the investment cycle, whereby privately held companies are funded by private equity investors and ultimately sold, merged, or taken public through an initial offering, which can vary based on overall market conditions, as well as the nature and type of industry in which the companies operate. The Corporation also invests in loan pools that support CRA loans. The timing of future cash requirements to fund these pools is dependent upon loan demand, which can vary over time. The aggregate carrying value of these investments was $ 25 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Legal Proceedings 

The Corporation is party to various pending and threatened claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcomes, the Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding matters and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously with respect to such legal proceedings. The Corporation will consider settlement of cases when, in management&#8217;s judgment, it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. 

On at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with all pending or threatened claims and litigation, utilizing the most recent information available. On a matter by matter basis, an accrual for loss is established for those matters which the Corporation believes it is probable that a loss may be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, each accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any subsequent developments. Accordingly, management&#8217;s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established. 

Resolution of legal claims is inherently unpredictable, and in many legal proceedings various factors exacerbate this inherent unpredictability, including where the damages sought are unsubstantiated or indeterminate, it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis, discovery is not complete, the proceeding is not yet in its final stages, the matters present legal uncertainties, there are significant facts in dispute, there are a large number of parties (including where it is uncertain how liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants), or there is a wide range of potential results. 

A lawsuit, Evans et al v. Associated Banc-Corp et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin - Green Bay Division on January 13, 2021 by one current and one former participant in the Associated Banc-Corp 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) as representatives of a putative class. The plaintiffs alleged that Associated Banc-Corp, the Associated Banc-Corp Plan Administrative Committee, and current and past members of such committee during the relevant time period (the &#8220;Defendants&#8221;) breached their fiduciary duties with respect to the Plan in violation of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, by applying an imprudent and inappropriate preference for products associated with Associated Banc-Corp within the Plan, and that the Defendants failed to monitor or control the recordkeeping expenses paid to Associated Trust Company, N.A. On March 18, 2021, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On April 8, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which dropped the record keeping claim, added Associated Trust Company N.A. and Kellogg Asset Management, LLC as defendants, and alleged various breaches of fiduciary duty related to the selection and monitoring of, and the fees charged by, proprietary collective investment trusts. The plaintiffs, in part, seek an accounting and disgorgement of certain profits, as well as certain equitable restitution and equitable monetary relief. The Corporation intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. It is not possible for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss at this time with respect to this lawsuit. 

Regulatory Matters 

A variety of consumer products, including mortgage and deposit products, and certain fees and charges related to such products, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny. It is possible that regulatory authorities could bring enforcement actions, including civil money penalties, or take other actions against the Corporation and the Bank in regard to these consumer products. The Bank could also determine of its own accord, or be required by regulators, to refund or otherwise make remediation payments to customers in connection with these products. It is not possible at this time for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss related to such matters. 

Operational Matters 

In November 2021, we became aware that during several routine purges of old documents, certain documents that were more than seven years old relating to active accounts were inadvertently purged from our electronic database. The active account documents that were inadvertently purged related to 1) certain customer documents obtained as part of bank acquisitions, and 2) certain customer documents that were transferred to a new cold storage system without correct retention coding. Both the acquisitions and the transfer occurred years ago. The majority of the documents inadvertently purged were signature cards. We have undertaken measures to replace (if possible) or otherwise lessen the impact on customers of any inadvertently purged documents. While the impact on the Company of this incident has been immaterial to date, and we are not aware of any material adverse customer impact, it is not possible at this time for management to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss related to this incident. 

Mortgage Repurchase Reserve 

The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans to investors in the normal course of business. Residential mortgage loans sold to others are predominantly conventional residential first lien mortgages originated under the Corporation's usual underwriting procedures, and are most often sold on a nonrecourse basis, primarily to the GSEs. The Corporation&#8217;s agreements to sell residential mortgage loans in the normal course of business usually require certain representations and warranties on the underlying loans sold, related to credit information, loan documentation, collateral, and insurability. Subsequent to being sold, if a material underwriting deficiency or documentation defect is discovered, the Corporation may be obligated to repurchase the loan or reimburse the GSEs for losses incurred (collectively, &#8220;make whole requests&#8221;). The make whole requests and any related risk of loss under the representations and warranties are largely driven by borrower performance. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2021, qualifying residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have been sold into GNMA pools. 

As a result of make whole requests, the Corporation has repurchased loans with aggregate principal balances of $ 8 million and $ 10 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were approximately $ 114,000 of loss reimbursement and settlement claims paid for the year ended December 31, 2021, and there were no such claims for the year ended December 31, 2020. Make whole requests during 2020 and 2021 generally arose from loans sold during the period of 

January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2020. Since January 1, 2012, loans sold totaled $ 16.1 billion at the time of sale, and consisted primarily of loans sold to GSEs. As of December 31, 2021, $ 6.5 billion of these sold loans remain outstanding. 

The balance in the mortgage repurchase reserve at the balance sheet date reflects the estimated amount of potential loss the Corporation could incur from repurchasing a loan, as well as loss reimbursements, indemnifications, and other settlement resolutions. The mortgage repurchase reserve, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, was $ 1 million and $ 2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The Corporation may also sell residential mortgage loans with limited recourse (limited in that the recourse period ends prior to the loan&#8217;s maturity, usually after certain time and / or loan paydown criteria have been met), whereby repurchase could be required if the loan had defined delinquency issues during the limited recourse periods. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were $ 10 million and $ 36 million, respectively, of residential mortgage loans sold with such recourse risk. There have been limited instances and immaterial historical losses on repurchases for recourse under the limited recourse criteria. 

The Corporation has a subordinate position to the FHLB in the credit risk on residential mortgage loans it sold to the FHLB in exchange for a monthly credit enhancement fee. The Corporation has not sold loans to the FHLB with such credit risk retention since February 2005. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were $ 24 million and $ 33 million, respectively, of such residential mortgage loans with credit risk recourse, upon which there have been negligible historical losses to the Corporation.

Note 18 Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value represents the estimated price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price concept). See Note 1 for the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policy for fair value measurements. 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Corporation&#8217;s more significant instruments measured on a recurring basis at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Investment Securities AFS: Where quoted prices are available in an active market, investment securities are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, with consideration given to the nature of the quote and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the fair value estimate, and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Lastly, in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the estimated fair value, securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. To validate the fair value estimates, assumptions, and controls, the Corporation looks to transactions for similar instruments and utilizes independent pricing provided by third party vendors or brokers and relevant market indices. While none of these sources are solely indicative of fair value, they serve as directional indicators for the appropriateness of the Corporation&#8217;s fair value estimates. The Corporation has determined that the fair value measures of its investment securities are classified predominantly within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 3 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities. 

Equity Securities with Readily Determinable Fair Values: The Corporation's portfolio of equity securities with readily determinable fair values is primarily comprised of CRA Qualified Investment mutual funds and other mutual funds. Since quoted prices for the Corporation's equity securities are readily available in an active market, they are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 3 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s equity securities. 

Residential Loans Held For Sale: Residential loans held for sale, which consist generally of current production of certain fixed-rate, first-lien residential mortgage loans, are carried at estimated fair value. Management has elected the fair value option to account for all newly originated mortgage loans held for sale, which results in the financial impact of changing market conditions being reflected currently in earnings as opposed to being dependent upon the timing of sales. Therefore, the continually adjusted values better reflect the price the Corporation expects to receive from the sale of such loans. The estimated fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics, which the Corporation classifies as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Interest Rate-Related Instruments): The Corporation offers interest rate-related instruments (swaps and caps) to service its customers&#8217; needs, for which the Corporation simultaneously enters into offsetting derivative financial instruments (i.e., mirror interest rate-related instruments) with third parties to manage its interest rate risk associated with these financial instruments. The valuation of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative and also includes a nonperformance / credit risk component (credit valuation adjustment). See Note 14 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s interest rate-related instruments. 

The discounted cash flow analysis component in the fair value measurement reflects the contractual terms of the derivative financial instruments, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. More specifically, the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) with the variable cash payments (or receipts) based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. Likewise, the fair values of interest rate options (i.e., interest rate caps) are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates fall below (or rise above) the strike rate of the floors (or caps), with the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the floor (or cap) based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. 

The Corporation also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative financial instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Corporation has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

While the Corporation has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate-related derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Corporation has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments for interest rate-related instruments. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the fair value measures of its derivative financial instruments for interest rate-related instruments in their entirety are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Foreign Currency Exchange Forwards): The Corporation provides foreign currency exchange services to customers. In addition, the Corporation may enter into a foreign currency exchange forward to mitigate the exchange rate risk attached to the cash flows of a loan or as an offsetting contract to a forward entered into as a service to its customer. The valuation of the Corporation&#8217;s foreign currency exchange forwards is determined using quoted prices of foreign currency exchange forwards with similar characteristics, with consideration given to the nature of the quote and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the fair value estimate, and is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 14 for additional disclosures regarding the Corporation&#8217;s foreign currency exchange forwards. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Commodity Contracts): The Corporation enters into commodity contracts to manage commercial customers' exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, for which the Corporation simultaneously enters into offsetting derivative financial instruments (i.e., mirror commodity contracts) with third parties to manage its risk associated with these financial instruments. The valuation of the Corporation&#8217;s commodity contracts is determined using quoted prices of the underlying instruments, and also includes a nonperformance / credit risk component (credit valuation adjustment). See Note 14 for additional disclosures regarding the Corporation&#8217;s commodity contracts. 

The Corporation also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative financial instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Corporation has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings. 

While the Corporation has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as probability of default and loss given default of the underlying loans to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Corporation has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments for commodity contracts. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the fair value measures of its derivative financial instruments for commodity contracts in their entirety are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021, the Corporation utilized the following valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs: 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Mortgage Derivative &#8212; Interest Rate Lock Commitments to Originate Residential Mortgage Loans Held For Sale): The fair value is determined by the change in value from each loan's rate lock date to the expected rate lock expiration date based on the underlying loan attributes, estimated closing ratios, and investor price matrix determined to be reasonably applicable to each loan commitment. The closing ratio calculation takes into consideration 

historical experience and loan-level attributes, particularly the change in the current interest rates from the time of initial rate lock. The closing ratio is periodically reviewed for reasonableness and reported to the Associated Mortgage Risk Management Committee. At December 31, 2021, the closing ratio was 86 %. 

Derivative Financial Instruments (Mortgage Derivative&#8212;Forward Commitments to Sell Mortgage Loans): Mortgage derivatives include forward commitments to deliver closed-end residential mortgage loans into conforming Agency MBS or conforming Cash Forward sales. The fair value of such instruments is determined by the difference of current market prices for such traded instruments or available from forward cash delivery commitments and the original traded price for such commitments. 

The Corporation also relies on an internal valuation model to estimate the fair value of its forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans (i.e., an estimate of what the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate the forward delivery contract based on market prices for similar financial instruments), which includes matching specific terms and maturities of the forward commitments against applicable investor pricing available. While there are Level 2 and 3 inputs used in the valuation models, the Corporation has determined that the majority of the inputs significant in the valuation of both of the mortgage derivatives fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 14 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s mortgage derivatives. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Corporation&#8217;s more significant instruments measured on a nonrecurring basis at LOCOM, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Commercial Loans Held For Sale: The estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, which the Corporation classifies as a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 

OREO: Certain OREO, upon initial recognition, was re-measured and reported at fair value through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated fair value of the OREO, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of OREO, upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment, was estimated using appraised values, which the Corporation classifies as a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 

For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2021, the Corporation utilized the following valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs. 

Individually Evaluated Loans: The Corporation individually evaluates loans when a commercial loan relationship is in nonaccrual status or when a commercial or consumer loan relationship has its terms restructured in a TDR or when a loan meets the Corporation's definition of a probable TDR. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the Corporation&#8217;s individually evaluated loans. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights: MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available to allow for a &#8220;quoted price for similar assets&#8221; comparison. Accordingly, the Corporation utilizes an independent valuation from a third party which uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its MSRs. The valuation model incorporates prepayment assumptions to project MSRs cash flows based on the current interest rate scenario, which is then discounted to estimate an expected fair value of the MSRs. The valuation model considers portfolio characteristics of the underlying mortgages, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, discount rate assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service, and other economic factors. The Corporation periodically reviews and assesses the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the model. In addition, the Corporation compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data for MSRs, where available, and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation uses the amortization method (i.e., LOCOM measured on a nonrecurring basis), not fair value measurement accounting, for its MSRs assets. 

The discounted cash flow analyses that generate expected market prices utilize the observable characteristics of the MSRs portfolio, as well as certain unobservable valuation parameters. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation&#8217;s MSRs are the weighted average constant prepayment rate and weighted average discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 

These parameter assumptions fall within a range that the Corporation, in consultation with an independent third party, believes purchasers of servicing would apply to such portfolios sold into the current secondary servicing market. Discussions are held with members from Treasury and the Community, Consumer, and Business segment to reconcile the fair value estimates and 

the key assumptions used by the respective parties in arriving at those estimates. The Associated Consumer Lending Risk Committee is responsible for providing control over the valuation methodology and key assumptions. To assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement, the Corporation also compares the fair value and constant prepayment rate to a value calculated by an independent third party on an annual basis. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s MSRs. 

On January 1, 2022, the Corporation elected to account for its MSRs under the fair value methodology. See Note 24 for details on the accounting policy change from LOCOM to fair value accounting. 

Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values: The Corporation measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. Included in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are 77,000 Visa Class B restricted shares carried at fair value. These shares are currently subject to certain transfer restrictions and will be convertible into Visa Class A shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. During the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation also acquired 996 Visa Class B restricted shares from the acquisition of First Staunton, and those shares are currently carried at a zero cost basis due to the lack of an observable market price since the time of acquisition. Based on the current conversion factor, the Corporation expects 77,996 shares of Visa Class B to convert to 126,205 shares of Visa Class A upon the litigation resolution. 

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Corporation will adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Corporation's estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities and other adjustments. See Note 3 for additional disclosure regarding the Corporation&#8217;s equity securities without readily determinable fair values. 

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of December 31, 2021 that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable. Also shown are the cumulative upward and downward adjustments for the Corporation's equity securities without readily determinable fair values as of December 31, 2021:

Note 19 Regulatory Matters 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

The Corporation and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Corporation&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Corporation&#8217;s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to 

average assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, that the Corporation meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

For additional information on the capital requirements applicable for the Corporation and the Bank, please see Part I, Item 1. 

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the most recent notifications from the OCC and the FDIC categorized the subsidiary bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the subsidiary bank must maintain minimum ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution&#8217;s category.

Note 21 Segment Reporting 

The Corporation utilizes a risk-based internal profitability measurement system to provide strategic business unit reporting. The profitability measurement system is based on internal management methodologies designed to produce consistent results and reflect the underlying economics of the units. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The three reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer, and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services. The financial information of the Corporation&#8217;s segments has been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in Note 1, with certain exceptions. The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. 

The reportable segment results are presented based on the Corporation's internal management accounting process. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to U.S. GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in previously reported segment financial data. Additionally, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 

To determine financial performance of each segment, the Corporation allocates FTP assignments, the provision for credit losses, certain noninterest expenses, income tax, and equity to each segment. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic adjustment as the internal management accounting system is revised, the interest rate environment evolves, and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically reviewed. 

The Corporation allocates net interest income using an internal FTP methodology that charges users of funds (assets) and credits providers of funds (liabilities, primarily deposits) based on the maturity, prepayment, and / or re-pricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of this allocation is offset in the Risk Management and Shared Services segment to ensure consolidated totals reflect the Corporation's net interest income. The net FTP allocation is reflected as net intersegment interest income (expense) in the accompanying tables. 

The provision for credit losses is allocated to segments based on the expected long-term annual net charge off rates attributable to the credit risk of loans managed by the segment during the period. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is determined based on an ACLL model using methodologies described in Note 1. The net effect of the provision for credit losses is recorded in Risk Management and Shared Services. Indirect expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expense and bank-wide expense accruals (including amortization of CDIs and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, asset gains on disposed business units, loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances, and income tax benefits as a result of corporate restructuring) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the Corporation&#8217;s estimated effective tax rate, with certain segments adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses with the net tax residual recorded in Risk Management and Shared Services. Equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk). 

A description of each business segment is presented below. 

Corporate and Commercial Specialty: The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment serves a wide range of customers including private clients, larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions by providing lending and deposit solutions as well as the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment, fiduciary, and retirement planning products and services to individuals, private clients, and small to mid-sized businesses. In serving this segment, we compete based on an in-depth understanding of our customers&#8217; financial needs, the ability to match market competitive solutions to those needs, and the highest standards of relationship and service excellence in the delivery of these services. Delivery of services is provided through our corporate and commercial units, our CRE unit, as well as our specialized industries and commercial financial services units. Within this segment we provide the following products and services: (1) lending solutions, such as commercial loans and lines of credit, CRE financing, construction loans, letters of credit, leasing, asset-based lending, and, for our larger clients, loan syndications; (2) deposit and cash management solutions such as commercial checking and interest-bearing deposit products, cash vault and night depository services, liquidity solutions, payables and receivables solutions, and information services; (3) specialized financial services such as interest rate risk management, foreign exchange solutions, and commodity hedging; (4) fiduciary services such as administration of pension, profit-sharing and other employee benefit plans, fiduciary and corporate agency services, and institutional asset management; and (5) investable funds solutions such as savings, money market deposit accounts, IRA accounts, CDs, fixed and variable annuities, full-service, discount and online investment brokerage; investment advisory services; and trust and investment management accounts. During the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation sold its wealth management subsidiary, Whitnell. 

Community, Consumer, and Business: The Community, Consumer, and Business segment serves individuals, as well as small and mid-sized businesses, by providing lending and deposit solutions. In addition, the Corporation offered insurance and risk consulting services, until the sale of the business in June of 2020. In serving this segment, we compete based on providing a broad range of solutions to meet the needs of our customers in their entire financial lifecycle, convenient access to our services through multiple channels such as branches, phone based services, online and mobile banking, and a relationship based business model which assists our customers in navigating any changes and challenges in their financial circumstances. Delivery of services is provided through our various consumer banking and community banking units. Within this segment we provide the following products and services: (1) lending solutions such as residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, personal and installment loans, auto loans, business loans, and business lines of credit, and (2) deposit and transactional solutions such as checking, credit, debit and pre-paid cards, online banking and bill pay, and money transfer services. 

Risk Management and Shared Services: The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared operational functions and also includes residual revenue and expenses, representing the difference between actual amounts incurred and the amounts allocated to operating segments, including interest rate risk residuals (FTP mismatches) and credit risk and provision residuals (long-term credit charge mismatches). All acquisition related costs, the asset gain on sale of ABRC, loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances, and the tax benefit from corporate restructuring are included within the Risk Management and Shared Services segment. 

Effective during 2021, select back office support functions that specifically support Community, Consumer and Business were reorganized under that segment from the Risk Management and Shared Services segment.

Below is a listing of performance obligations for the Corporation's main revenue streams: 

##TABLE_START Revenue Stream Noninterest income in-scope of Topic 606 Service charges and deposit account fees Service charges on deposit accounts consist of monthly service fees (i.e. business analyzed fees and consumer service charges) and other deposit account related fees. The Corporation's performance obligation for monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. Other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Corporation's performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service charges and deposit account fees is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to the customers&#8217; accounts. 

Card-based fees (a) 

Card-based fees are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, ATM fees, and merchant services income. Debit and credit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Corporation's debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks. ATM and merchant fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Corporation's performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month. 

Trust and asset management fees (b) 

Trust and asset management income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets. The Corporation's performance obligation is generally satisfied over time and the resulting fees are recognized monthly, based upon the month-end market value of the assets under management and the applicable fee rate. Payment is generally received a few days after month end through a direct charge to the customers&#8217; accounts. The Corporation's performance obligation for these transactional-based services is generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time (i.e., as incurred). Payment is received shortly after services are rendered. 

Brokerage and advisory fees (b) 

Brokerage and advisory fees primarily consists of investment advisory, brokerage, retirement services, and annuities. The Corporation's performance obligation for investment advisory services and retirement services is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the services are provided. The performance obligation for annuities is satisfied upon sale of the annuity, and therefore, the related revenue is primarily recognized at the time of sale. Payment for these services are typically received immediately or in advance of the service. ##TABLE_END
