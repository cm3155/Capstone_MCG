Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of State Street Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of State Street Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. 

##TABLE_START Servicing Fee Revenue Description of the Matter Revenue recognized by the Corporation as servicing fees was $5.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. As disclosed in Notes 24 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements, servicing fee revenue involves revenue streams from various products which include custody, product accounting, daily pricing and administration, master trust and master custody, depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-US regulation), record-keeping, cash management, investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing. The Corporation&#8217;s servicing fee revenue involves a significant volume of contracts and transactions and is sourced from multiple systems and processes across different business teams and geographies. 

Auditing servicing fee revenue was complex and involved significant audit effort due to the non-standard nature of the Corporation&#8217;s contracts, the volume of contracts, the impact of contract renegotiations on accrued servicing fees, and the number of different processes used to recognize revenue. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We identified and obtained an understanding of the processes used by the Corporation to recognize revenue transactions. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Corporation&#8217;s processes for recognizing servicing fee revenue, including, among others, controls over the review of client contracts, the calculations of the key drivers of revenue (e.g., assets under custody) and the flow of this information from the business teams negotiating contract amendments to the department accruing revenue. 

Among other procedures, to test servicing fee revenue, we selected a sample of client contracts and analyzed the contracts to determine whether terms that may have an impact on revenue recognition, including performance obligations and specified fees, were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contracts. In addition, we reperformed the calculation of revenue for a sample of revenue transactions. We also agreed the amounts recognized to source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue. We inquired of the business teams involved in contract negotiations for a selection of clients to assess the state of those negotiations and any effect on accrued servicing fees. We obtained third party confirmation of the client balance due for a sample of servicing fees receivable.

Investment Servicing provides a suite of related products and services including: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. 

Included within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers. 

Investment Management , through State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and 

governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR &#174; ETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. 

Consolidation 

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its majority- and wholly-owned and otherwise controlled subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation. 

We consolidate subsidiaries in which we exercise control. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, recorded in other assets, generally are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee. For investments accounted for under the equity method, our share of income or loss is recorded in software and processing fees in our consolidated statement of income. Investments not meeting the criteria for equity-method treatment are measured at fair value through earnings, except for investments where a fair market value is not readily available, which are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that may materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses. As a result of unanticipated events or circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The assets and liabilities of our operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at rates that approximate average monthly exchange rates. Gains or losses from the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, net of related taxes, are recorded in AOCI, a component of shareholders&#8217; equity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks. 

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks 

Interest-bearing deposits with banks generally consist of highly liquid, short-term investments maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank and other non-U.S. central banks with original maturities at the time of purchase of one month or less. 

Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements 

Securities purchased under resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions, and are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Our policy is to take possession or control of securities underlying resale agreements either directly or through agent banks, allowing borrowers the right of collateral substitution and/or short-notice termination. We revalue these securities daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower to protect us against credit exposure. We can use these securities as collateral for repurchase agreements. 

For securities sold under repurchase agreements collateralized by our investment securities portfolio, the dollar value of the securities remains in investment securities in our consolidated statement of condition. Where a master netting agreement exists or both parties are members of a common clearing organization, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty or clearing house and maturity date are recorded on a net basis. 

Fee and Net Interest Income 

The majority of fees from investment servicing, investment management, securities finance, trading services and certain types of software and processing fees are recorded in our consolidated statement of income based on the consideration specified in contracts with our customers, and excludes taxes collected from customers subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. We recognize revenue as the services are performed or at a point in time depending on the nature of the services provided. Payments made to third party service providers are generally recognized on a gross basis when we control those services and are deemed to be the principal. Additional information about revenue from contracts with customers is provided in Note 25. 

Interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities are 

recorded in our consolidated statement of income as components of NII, and are generally based on the effective yield of the related financial asset or liability.

Recent Accounting Developments 

Relevant standards that were adopted in 2020: 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as CECL methodology. This standard requires immediate recognition of expected credit losses for certain financial assets and off-balance sheet commitments, including trade and other receivables, loans and commitments, held-to-maturity debt securities, and other financial assets held at amortized cost at the reporting date, to be measured based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Credit losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an allowance against the amortized cost basis of the security, limited to the amount by which the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, and reversal of impairment losses are allowed when the credit of the issuer improves. 

ASC 326 was adopted using a modified retrospective method of transition for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off balance sheet commitments, which requires the impact of applying the standard on prior periods to be reflected in opening retained earnings upon adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 are presented under the CECL methodology in ASC 326, while prior period amounts are reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The impact of transitioning to ASC 326 on the consolidated financial statements was an increase in the allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $ 3 million primarily arising from: 

&#8226; An increase of $ 1 million in the allowance for credit losses related to loans and other financial assets held at amortized cost. 

&#8226; An increase of $ 2 million in the allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments. 

In January 2020, we adopted the remaining provisions of ASU 2018-13 - Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework- Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value, specifically the provisions of the standard that add disclosures. We previously adopted the provisions of the standard that eliminated or amended disclosures as of December 31, 2018. There were no material impacts to the disclosures as a result of the adoption. 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. There were no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption. 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. There were no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption. 

ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting is effective as of March 12, 2020. The guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the existing guidance in U.S. GAAP on contract modifications and hedge accounting in relation to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance also allows a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify to AFS or trading HTM debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. We expect to elect certain of the optional expedients and are evaluating the one-time election to sell/transfer HTM securities impacted by reference rate reform. 

We continue to evaluate accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2020, but none are expected to have a material impact to our financial statements. 

Note 2. Fair Value 

Fair Value Measurements 

We carry trading account assets and liabilities, AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments, at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of AOCI within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. 

We measure fair value for the above-described financial assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP that governs the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Management believes that its valuation techniques and underlying assumptions used to measure fair value conform to the provisions of U.S. GAAP. We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value based on a prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). If the inputs used to measure a financial asset or liability cross different levels of the hierarchy, categorization is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to 

State Street Corporation | 135 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

the overall fair-value measurement of a financial asset or liability requires judgment, and considers factors specific to that asset or liability. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are described below. 

Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. Our level 1 financial assets and liabilities primarily include positions in U.S. government securities and highly liquid U.S. and non-U.S. government fixed-income securities. Our level 1 financial assets also include actively traded exchange- traded equity securities. 

Level 2. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: 

&#9642; Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 

&#9642; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; 

&#9642; Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and 

&#9642; Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market information through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

Our level 2 financial assets and liabilities primarily include non-U.S. debt securities carried in trading account assets and various types of fixed-income AFS investment securities, as well as various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative instruments. 

Fair value for our AFS investment securities categorized in level 2 is measured primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. This third-party information is subject to review by management as part of a validation process, which includes obtaining an understanding of the underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back- testing. 

Derivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represent foreign exchange contracts 

used in our trading activities, for which fair value is measured using discounted cash-flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties. We consider factors such as the likelihood of default by our counterparties, our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not material to those instruments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Level 3. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable in the market and significant to the overall measurement of fair value. These inputs reflect management's judgment about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the financial asset or liability, and are based on the best available information, some of which may be internally developed. The following provides a more detailed discussion of our financial assets and liabilities that we may categorize in level 3 and the related valuation methodology. 

&#8226; The fair value of our investment securities categorized in level 3 is measured using information obtained from third-party sources, typically non-binding broker/dealer quotes, or through the use of internally-developed pricing models. Management has evaluated its methodologies used to measure fair value and has considered the level of observable market information to be insufficient to categorize the securities in level 2. 

&#8226; The fair value of certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily options, is measured using an option-pricing model. Because of a limited number of observable transactions, certain model inputs are not observable, such as implied volatility surface, but are derived from observable market information. 

Our level 3 financial assets and liabilities are similar in structure and profile to our level 1 and level 2 financial instruments, but they trade in less liquid markets, and the measurement of their fair value is inherently less observable. 

The following tables present information with respect to our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 

Estimates of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition are generally subjective in nature, and are determined as of a specific point in time based on the characteristics of the financial instruments and relevant market information. Disclosure of fair value estimates is not required by U.S. GAAP for certain items, such as lease financing, equity- method investments, obligations for pension and other post-retirement plans, premises and equipment, other intangible assets and income-tax assets and liabilities. Accordingly, aggregate fair-value estimates presented do not purport to represent, and should not be considered representative of, our underlying &#8220;market&#8221; or franchise value. In addition, because of potential differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values, our estimates of fair value should not be compared to those of other financial institutions. 

We use the following methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments: 

&#8226; For financial instruments that have quoted market prices, those quoted prices are used to estimate fair value; 

&#8226; For financial instruments that have no defined maturity, have a remaining maturity of 180 days or less, or reprice frequently to a market rate, we assume that the fair value of these instruments approximates their reported value, after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk; and 

&#8226; For financial instruments for which no quoted market prices are available, fair value is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties, or by discounting the expected cash flows using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument. 

The generally short duration of certain of our assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments for which fair value equals or closely approximates the amount recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. These financial instruments are reported in the following captions in our consolidated statement of condition: cash and due from banks; interest-bearing deposits with banks; securities purchased under resale agreements; accrued interest and fees receivable; deposits; securities sold under repurchase agreements; and other short-term borrowings. 

In addition, due to the relatively short duration of certain of our loans, we consider fair value for these loans to approximate their reported value. The fair value of other types of loans, such as leveraged loans, commercial real estate loans, purchased receivables and municipal loans is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties or by discounting expected future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. Commitments to lend have no reported value because their terms are at prevailing market rates.

Note 3. Investment Securities 

Investment securities held by us are classified as either trading account assets, AFS, HTM or equity securities held at fair value at the time of purchase and reassessed periodically, based on management&#8217;s intent. 

Generally, trading assets are debt and equity securities purchased in connection with our trading activities and, as such, are expected to be sold in the near term. Our trading activities typically involve active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating profits on short-term movements. AFS investment securities are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time. AFS investment securities include securities utilized as part of our asset and liability management activities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs or other factors. HTM securities are debt securities that management has the intent and the ability to hold to maturity. 

Starting in the first quarter of 2020, we supported our clients' liquidity needs through the MMLF program, purchasing a total of $ 29 billion of investment securities under that program, $ 3.3 billion of which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2020. 

Trading assets are carried at fair value. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading assets are recorded in foreign exchange trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. AFS securities are carried at fair value, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. Gains or losses realized on sales of AFS investment securities are computed using the specific identification method and are recorded in gains (losses) related to investment securities, net, in our consolidated statement of income. HTM investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2020, we recognized an allowance for credit losses on HTM investment securities of $ 3 million. 

Prior to adoption of ASC 326 in 2020, AFS securities were carried at fair value, and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses were recorded in AOCI. HTM investment securities were carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Aggregate investment securities with carrying values of approximately $ 70.57 billion and $ 49.48 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, short-term borrowings and for other purposes as provided by law. 

In 2020, 2019 and 2018, $ 8.60 billion, $ 3.98 billion and $ 2.13 million, respectively, of agency MBS, previously classified as AFS, were transferred to HTM. These transfers reflect our intent to hold these securities until their maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value, which included a net unrealized gain of $ 120 million and $ 49 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a net unrealized loss of $ 53 million as of December 31, 2018, within accumulated other comprehensive loss which will be accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the transferred security (ranging from approximately 3 to 37 years). 

In 2018, $ 1.22 billion of HTM securities, primarily consisting of MBS and CMBS, were transferred to AFS at book value and sold at a pre-tax loss of approximately $ 36 million, due to our election to make a one-time transfer of securities relating to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. 

In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we sold approximately $ 2.65 billion, $ 5.64 billion and $ 26.37 billion, respectively, of AFS securities, primarily ABS and municipal bonds, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 4 million in 2020, a pre-tax loss less than $ 1 million in 2019 and a pre-tax gain of $ 9 million in 2018. 

The following table presents the aggregate fair values of AFS investment securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer, as of the dates indicated:

Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The level rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, adjusted as prepayments occur, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Debt Securities and Impairment of AFS Securities 

As discussed in Note 1, we adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020. We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether an allowance for credit losses is required. HTM securities are evaluated for expected credit loss utilizing a probability of default methodology, or discounted cash flows assessed against the amortized cost of the investment security excluding accrued interest. An AFS security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. An allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities is recorded when the present value of expected future cash flows of the investment security is less than its amortized cost basis, limited to the amount by which the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value. 

We monitor the credit quality of the HTM and AFS investment securities using a variety of methods, including both external and internal credit ratings. As 

of December 31, 2020, 99 % of our HTM and AFS investment portfolio is publicly rated investment grade. 

Our allowance for credit losses on our HTM securities is approximately $ 3 million as of December 31, 2020 and we recorded a $ 3 million provision and no charge-offs on HTM securities in 2020. 

Our review of impaired AFS investment securities generally includes: 

&#8226; the identification and evaluation of securities that have indications of potential impairment, such as issuer-specific concerns, including deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy; 

&#8226; the analysis of expected future cash flows of securities, based on quantitative and qualitative factors; 

&#8226; the analysis of the collectability of those future cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts; 

&#8226; the analysis of the underlying collateral for MBS and ABS; 

&#8226; the analysis of individual impaired securities, including the anticipated recovery period and the magnitude of the overall price decline; 

&#8226; evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual securities to be deemed impaired and those that would not support impairment; and 

&#8226; documentation of the results of these analyses. 

Substantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities. A critical component of our assessment of impairment of these debt securities is the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. 

Debt securities that are not deemed to be credit impaired are subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intends to sell, or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis. 

With respect to certain classes of debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries and agency securities (mainly issued by U.S. Government entities and agencies, as well as Group of Seven sovereigns), we consider the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero. Therefore, for those securities, we do not record expected credit losses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

We have elected to not record an allowance on accrued interest for HTM and AFS securities. Accrued Interest on these securities is reversed against interest income when payment on a security is delinquent for greater than 90 days from the date of payment. 

After a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration then-current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $ 123 million related to 503 securities as of December 31, 2020 to not be the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. 

Prior to the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we assessed our AFS and HTM securities for impairment under an OTTI model. Under this model impairment of AFS and HTM debt securities was recorded in our consolidated statement of income when management intended to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recovered in value, or when management expected the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss). The review of impaired securities under the OTTI model was consistent with the considerations noted for AFS securities under ASC 326. Where impairment was indicated based on our review, the following factors were also considered in determining whether impairment was other than temporary: 

&#8226; certain macroeconomic drivers; 

&#8226; certain industry-specific drivers; 

&#8226; the length of time the security has been impaired; 

&#8226; the severity of the impairment; 

&#8226; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; 

&#8226; activity in the market with respect to the issuer's securities, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; and 

&#8226; our intention not to sell, and the likelihood that we will not be required to sell, the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for its recovery in value. 

Substantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities. A critical 

component of our assessment of OTTI of these debt securities was the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management did not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Debt securities that were not deemed to be credit-impaired were subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intended to sell, or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis. 

We recorded less than $1 million and $ 3 million of OTTI, included in other income, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which resulted from adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from non-U.S. mortgage- and asset backed securities. 

The following table presents a roll-forward with respect to net impairment losses that had been recognized in income for the periods indicated:

After a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration then-current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considered the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $ 123 million and $ 169 million related to 503 and 622 securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, to be temporary, and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. 

Note 4. Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Loans are generally recorded at their principal amount outstanding, net of the allowance for credit losses, unearned income, and any net unamortized deferred loan origination fees. Loans that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis. 

Interest income related to loans is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level

rate of return over the term of the loan. Fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of credit that we anticipate will result in loans typically are deferred and amortized to interest income over the term of the related loan, beginning with the initial borrowing. Fees on commitments and letters of credit are amortized to software and processing fees over the commitment period when funding is not known or expected. 

The following table presents our recorded investment in loans, by segment, as of the dates indicated:

(1) Domestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower&#8217;s country of domicile. 

(2) Fund finance loans include primarily $ 6,391 million loans to real money funds, $ 8,380 million private equity capital call finance loans and $ 821 million loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2020, compared to $ 6,040 million loans to real money funds, $ 6,076 million private equity capital call finance loans and $ 932 million loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2019. 

(3) Includes $ 1,911 million securities finance loans, $ 754 million loans to municipalities and $ 54 million other loans as of December 31, 2020 and $ 2,537 million securities finance loans, $ 848 million loans to municipalities and $ 26 million other loans as of December 31, 2019. 

We segregate our loans into two segments: commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans. These classifications reflect their risk characteristics, their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk. 

The commercial and financial segment is composed of primarily floating-rate loans, purchased leveraged loans, overdrafts and other loans. Fund finance loans are composed of revolving credit lines providing liquidity and leverage to mutual fund and private equity fund clients. 

Certain loans are pledged as collateral for access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the loans pledged as collateral totaled $ 8.07 billion and $ 6.75 billion, respectively. 

We generally place loans on non-accrual status once principal or interest payments are 90 days contractually past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 90 days past due, but considered both well-secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non-accrual status. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and generally charged against interest income. For loans on non-accrual status, income is recognized on a cash basis after recovery of principal, if and when interest payments are received. Loans may be removed from non-accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and performance under the terms of the loan has been demonstrated. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no loans on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2020, we had one loan with principal or interest payments 30 days or more contractually past due, that was subsequently paid in January 2021. As of December 31, 2019, we had no loans with principal or interest payments 30 days or more contractually past due. 

We sold $ 353 million of leveraged loans in 2020. We recorded a charge-off against the allowance for these loans prior to the sale of these loans of $ 41 million in 2020. 

In certain circumstances, we restructure troubled loans by granting concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Once restructured, the loans are generally considered impaired until their maturity, regardless of whether the borrowers perform under the modified terms of the loans. There were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We recognize an allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326 for financial assets held at amortized cost and off-balance sheet commitments. Further discussion of our adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, including the impact on our consolidated financial statements, is provided in Note 1. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses for investment securities, please refer to Note 3. 

When the allowance is recorded, a provision for credit loss expense is recognized in net income. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets (excluding investment securities, as discussed in Note 3) represents the portion of the amortized cost basis, including accrued interest for financial assets 

State Street Corporation | 150 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

held at amortized cost, which management does not expect to recover due to expected credit losses and is presented on the statement of condition as an offset to the amortized cost basis. The accrued interest balance is presented separately on the statement of condition within accrued interest and fees receivable. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is presented within other liabilities. Loans are charged off to the allowance for credit losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurs that confirms the existence of a loss on a loan, including a sale of a loan below its carrying value, or a portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible. 

The allowance for credit losses may be determined using various methods, including discounted cash flow methods, loss-rate methods, probability-of-default methods, and other quantitative or qualitative methods as determined by us. The method used to estimate expected credit losses may vary depending on the type of financial asset, our ability to predict the timing of cash flows, and the information available to us. 

The allowance for credit losses as reported in our consolidated statement of condition is adjusted by provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of principal amounts, net of recoveries. 

We measure expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristic exist. Each reporting period, we assess whether the assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics. 

For a financial asset that does not share risk characteristics with other assets, expected credit losses are measured based on the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, utilizing the effective interest rate and the amortized cost basis of the asset. As of December 31, 2020, we had 5 loans for $ 77 million in the commercial and financial segment that no longer met the similar risk characteristics of their collective pool. We recorded an allowance for credit losses of $ 6 million as of December 31, 2020 on these loans. 

When the asset is collateral dependent, which means when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated costs to sell. 

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant 

changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. 

We estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset, while factoring in prepayment activity, where supported by data, over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management&#8217;s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable. 

As part of our allowance methodology, we establish qualitative reserves to address any risks inherent in our portfolio that are not addressed through our quantitative reserve assessment. These factors may relate to, among other things, legislation changes or new regulation, credit concentration, loan markets, scenario weighting and overall model limitations. The qualitative adjustments are applied to our portfolio of financial instruments under the existing governance structure and are inherently judgmental. 

Prior to the implementation of ASC 326, we reviewed loans for indicators of impairment. Loans where indicators existed were evaluated individually for impairment at least quarterly. For those loans where no such indicators were identified, the loans were collectively evaluated for impairment. As of December 31, 2019, we had one loan for $ 25 million in the commercial and financial segment that was individually evaluated for impairment and deemed to be impaired. We recorded a specific reserve of $ 1 million for this loan. 

Credit Quality 

Credit quality for financial assets held at amortized cost are continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses. 

We use an internal risk-rating system to assess our risk of credit loss for each loan. This risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a systematic manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned. 

When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes asset pools based on loss history,

delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall asset portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes in order to enable the earliest possible detection of any concerns with the customer&#8217;s credit rating. The results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and transactions with counterparties and in our process for estimation of expected credit losses. 

In assessing the risk rating assigned to each individual loan, among the factors considered are the borrower's debt capacity, collateral coverage, payment history and delinquency experience, financial flexibility and earnings strength, the expected amounts and source of repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, if any, and the industry and geography in which the borrower operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Credit counterparties are evaluated and risk-rated on an individual basis at least annually. Management considers the ratings to be current as of December 31, 2020. 

Management regularly reviews financial assets in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loans classification and grading in accordance with applicable bank regulations. Our internal risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings to counterparties ranging from Investment Grade, Speculative, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss. 

&#8226; Investment Grade. Counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. Approximately 81 % of our loans were rated as investment grade as of December 31, 2020 with external credit ratings, or equivalent, of "BBB-" or better. 

&#8226; Speculative. Counterparties that have the ability to repay but face significant uncertainties, such as adverse business or financial circumstances that could affect credit risk. Loans to counterparties rated 

as speculative account for approximately 19 % of our loans as of December 31, 2020, and are concentrated in leveraged loans. Approximately 85 % of those leveraged loans have an external credit rating, or equivalent, of "BB" or "B" as of December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Special Mention. Counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects. 

&#8226; Substandard. Counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss. 

&#8226; Doubtful. Counterparties with well-defined weakness which make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. 

&#8226; Loss. Counterparties which are uncollectible or have little value. 

The following tables present our recorded loans to counterparties by risk rating, as noted above, as of the dates indicated:

The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represents management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses primarily in outstanding letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is evaluated quarterly by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this allowance are similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. Provisions to maintain the allowance at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in outstanding facilities are recorded in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of income. 

The following table presents the amortized cost basis, by year of origination and credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2020. For origination years before the fifth annual period, we present the aggregate amortized cost basis of loans. For purchased loans, the date of issuance is used to determine the year of origination, not the date of acquisition. For modified, extended or renewed lending arrangements, we evaluate whether a credit event has occurred which would consider the loan to be a new arrangement.

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Loans are reviewed on a regular basis, and any provisions for credit losses that are recorded reflect management's estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. We recorded $ 88 million provision for credit losses in 2020, which reflected both downward credit migration within our loan portfolio and revision in management&#8217;s economic outlook reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and management may use qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change. 

Allowance for Loan Losses under Incurred Loss Methodology for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 

On-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 

Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for each segment of our loan portfolio under the incurred loss model included loss experience, the probability of default reflected in our internal risk rating of the counterparty's creditworthiness, then-current economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, if any, the performance of individual credits in relation to contract terms, and other relevant factors. 

Loans were charged off to the allowance for loan losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurred that confirmed the existence of a loss on a loan, including a sale of a loan below its carrying value, or a portion of a loan was determined to be uncollectible. In addition, any impaired loan that was determined to be collateral-dependent was reduced to an amount equal to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. A loan was identified as collateral-dependent when management determined that it was probable that the underlying collateral would be the sole source of repayment. Recoveries were recorded on a cash basis as adjustments to the allowance. 

The following table presents activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated under the incurred loss methodology:

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 

The reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represented management&#8217;s estimate of probable credit losses primarily in letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date. 

The reserve was evaluated on a regular basis by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this reserve were similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for loan losses. Provisions to maintain the reserve at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated incurred credit losses in outstanding facilities were recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. 

Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to at least annual evaluation for impairment. Other intangible assets, which are subject to evaluation for impairment, are mainly related to client relationships, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from five to twenty years , technology assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years , and core deposit intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from sixteen to twenty-two years , with such amortization recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. 

Impairment of goodwill is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its allocation of goodwill and other intangible assets, exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairment of other 

State Street Corporation | 154 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

intangible assets is deemed to exist if the balance of the other intangible asset exceeds the cumulative expected net cash inflows related to the asset over its remaining estimated useful life. If these reviews determine that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the value of the goodwill or the other intangible asset is written down through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. There were no impairments to goodwill or other intangible assets in 2020, 2019 and 2018.

We maintain an agreement with a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities purchased under resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. As a result of this netting, the average balances of securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements were reduced by $ 100.45 billion in 2020 compared to $ 86.67 billion in 2019. The increase in average balance sheet netting, in 2020 compared to 2019, is primarily due to the expansion of our FICC program and new client activity. 

State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit of CAD 1.40 billion, or approximately $ 1.10 billion, as of December 31, 2020, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a cash tender offer for approximately $ 297 million of our $ 800 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047, resulting in a gain of approximately $ 44 million. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a redemption for approximately $ 50 million of our $ 150 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2028. 

Termination of Replacement Capital Covenant 

Prior to November 20, 2019, we were subject to a replacement capital covenant dated April 30, 2007 (the Original RCC), as amended by the amendment to replacement capital covenant dated May 13, 2016 (the RCC Amendment and, together with the Original RCC, the Replacement Capital Covenant). Pursuant to the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenant, neither us nor any of our subsidiaries, including State Street Bank, was permitted to repay, redeem or purchase any of the outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 prior to June 1, 2047 unless certain conditions had been satisfied, except to the extent that (i) we obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, if such approval was then required, and (ii) we had received proceeds, up to specified percentages of the aggregate principal amount repaid or the applicable redemption or purchase price, from the sale or issuance of qualifying securities with characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 during the 180 days prior to the date of that repayment, redemption or purchase (which period was to be shortened under certain specified circumstances). The Replacement Capital Covenant was a covenant for the benefit of persons buying, holding or selling specified series of our unsecured long-term indebtedness or our depository institution subsidiaries (the Covered Debt). The original Covered Debt under the Replacement Capital Covenant were the outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2028. 

The Replacement Capital Covenant was terminated automatically without further action on November 20, 2019, following the settlement of the partial redemption of approximately $ 50 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2028 and the redesignation of our 2.650% Senior Notes due 2026 as Covered Debt for the purposes of the Replacement Capital Covenant, and purchases of the floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 are permissible without issuing qualifying securities under the Replacement Capital Covenant. 

Parent Company 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-term finance leases included $ 103 million and $ 136 million, respectively, related to our One Lincoln Street headquarters building and related underground parking garage. Refer to Note 20 for additional information. 

Note 10. Derivative Financial Instruments 

We use derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risks. These financial instruments consist of FX contracts such as forwards, futures and options contracts; interest rate contracts such as interest rate swaps (cross currency and single currency) and futures; and other derivative contracts. Derivative instruments used for risk management purposes that are highly effective in offsetting the risk being hedged are generally designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships, while others are economic hedges and not designated in hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives in hedge accounting relationships are disclosed according to the type of hedge, such as, fair value, cash flow, or net investment. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships are carried at fair value with change in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income or OCI, as appropriate. Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include those derivatives entered into to support client needs and derivatives used to manage interest rate or foreign currency risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. Such derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 

We provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of our client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures. The entire change in the fair value of our non-hedging derivatives utilized in our trading activities are recorded in foreign exchange trading services revenue, and the entire change in fair value of our non-hedging derivatives utilized in our asset-and-liability management activities are recorded in net interest income. 

We enter into stable value wrap derivative contracts with unaffiliated stable value funds that 

State Street Corporation | 158 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

allow a stable value fund to provide book value coverage to its participants. These derivatives contracts qualify as guarantees as described in Note 12. 

We grant deferred cash awards to certain of our employees as part of our employee incentive compensation plans. We account for these awards as derivative financial instruments, as the underlying referenced shares are not equity instruments of ours. The fair value of these derivatives is referenced to the value of units in State Street-sponsored investment funds or funds sponsored by other unrelated entities. We re-measure these derivatives to fair value quarterly, and record the change in value in compensation and employee benefits expenses in our consolidated statement of income. 

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 

In connection with our asset-and-liability management activities, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk and foreign currency risk for certain assets and liabilities. At both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we formally assess and document the effectiveness of a derivative designated in a hedging relationship and the likelihood that the derivative will be an effective hedge in future periods. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying risk being hedged, the derivative expires, terminates or is sold, or management discontinues the hedge designation. 

The risk management objective of a highly effective hedging strategy that qualifies for hedge accounting must be formally documented. The hedge documentation includes the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction, type of risk being hedged and method for assessing hedge effectiveness of the derivative prospectively and retrospectively. We use quantitative methods including regression analysis and cumulative dollar offset method, comparing the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item. We may also utilize qualitative methods such as matching critical terms and evaluation of any changes in those critical terms. Effectiveness is assessed and documented quarterly and if determined that the derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated risk hedge accounting is discontinued. 

Fair Value Hedges 

Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are utilized to mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities, including long-term debt, AFS securities, and foreign currency investment securities. We use interest rate or FX 

contracts in this manner to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items caused by changes in interest rates or FX rates. 

Changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in fair value of the hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same line item. If a hedge is terminated, but the hedged item was not derecognized, all remaining adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item are amortized over a period that is consistent with the amortization of other discounts or premiums associated with the hedged item . 

Cash Flow Hedges 

Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are utilized to offset the variability of cash flows of recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. We have entered into FX contracts to hedge the change in cash flows attributable to FX movements in foreign currency denominated investment securities. Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with LIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. The interest rate swaps synthetically convert the loan interest receipts from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate, thereby mitigating the risk attributable to changes in the LIBOR benchmark rate. 

Changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in AOCI and then reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the hedge relationship is terminated, the change in fair value on the derivative recorded in AOCI is reclassified into earnings consistent with the timing of the hedged item. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge terms, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum maturity date of the underlying loans is approximately 3.7 years. 

Net Investment Hedges 

Derivatives categorized as net investment hedges are entered into to protect the net investment in our foreign operations against adverse changes in exchange rates. We use FX forward contracts to convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in FX rates. The changes in fair value of the FX forward contracts are recorded, net of taxes, in the foreign currency translation component of OCI.

Derivatives Netting and Credit Contingencies 

Netting 

Derivatives receivable and payable as well as cash collateral from the same counterparty are netted in the consolidated statement of condition for those counterparties with whom we have legally binding master netting agreements in place. In addition to cash collateral received and transferred presented on a net basis, we also receive and transfer collateral in the form of securities, which mitigate credit risk but are not eligible for netting. Additional information on netting is provided in Note 11. 

Credit Contingencies 

Certain of our derivatives are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties containing credit risk-related contingent features, which requires us to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the various credit rating agencies. If our rating falls below investment grade, we would be in violation of the provisions, and counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate payment or demand full overnight collateralization on derivatives instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit contingent features and in a liability position as of December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $ 3.91 billion, against which we provided $ 1.69 billion of collateral in the normal course of business. If our credit related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered as of December 31, 2020, the maximum additional collateral we would be required to post to our counterparties is approximately $ 2.22 billion.

Note 11. Offsetting Arrangements 

Certain of our transactions are subject to master netting agreements that allow us to net receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. For those legally enforceable contracts, we net receivables and payables with the same counterparty on our statement of condition. 

In addition to netting receivables and payables with our derivatives counterparty where a legal and enforceable netting arrangement exist, we also net related cash collateral received and transferred up to the fair value exposure amount. 

With respect to our securities financing arrangements, we net balances outstanding on our consolidated statement of condition for those transactions that met the netting requirements and were transacted under a legally enforceable netting arrangement with the counterparty. 

Securities received as collateral under securities financing or derivatives transactions can be transferred as collateral in many instances. The securities received as proceeds under secured lending transactions are recorded at a value that approximates fair value in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition with a related liability to return the collateral, if we have the right to transfer or re-pledge the collateral. 

As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the value of securities received as collateral from third parties where we are permitted to transfer or re-pledge the securities totaled $ 6.48 billion and $ 10.09 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been transferred or re-pledged as of the same dates was $ 3.88 billion and $ 5.72 million, respectively.

The securities transferred under resale and repurchase agreements typically are U.S. Treasury, agency and agency MBS. In our principal securities borrowing and lending arrangements, the securities transferred are predominantly equity securities and some corporate debt securities. The fair value of the securities transferred may increase in value to an amount greater than the amount received under our repurchase and securities lending arrangements, which exposes us to counterparty risk. We require the review of the price of the underlying securities in relation to the carrying value of the repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements on a daily basis and when appropriate, adjust the cash or security to be obtained or returned to counterparties that is reflective of the required collateral levels. 

The following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions by category of collateral pledged and remaining maturity of these agreements as of the periods indicated:

Note 12. Commitments and Guarantees 

The following table presents the aggregate gross contractual amounts of our off-balance sheet commitments and off-balance sheet guarantees as of the dates indicated:

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

(1) The potential losses associated with these guarantees equal the gross contractual amounts and do not consider the value of any collateral or reflect any participations to independent third parties. 

Unfunded Credit Facilities 

Unfunded credit facilities consist primarily of liquidity facilities provided to our fund and municipal counterparties, as well as commitments to purchase commercial real estate and leveraged loans that have not yet settled. 

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 73 % of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year . Since many of these commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements. 

Indemnified Securities Financing 

On behalf of our clients, we lend their securities, as agent, to brokers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. We require the borrowers to maintain collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. 

The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against the loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. 

The following table summarizes the aggregate fair values of indemnified securities financing and related collateral, as well as collateral invested in indemnified repurchase agreements, as of the dates indicated: 

##TABLE_START (In millions) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Fair value of indemnified securities financing $ 440,875 &#160; $ 367,901 &#160; Fair value of cash and securities held by us, as agent, as collateral for indemnified securities financing 463,273 &#160; 385,428 &#160; Fair value of collateral for indemnified securities financing invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 54,432 &#160; 45,658 &#160; Fair value of cash and securities held by us or our agents as collateral for investments in indemnified repurchase agreements 58,092 &#160; 48,887 &#160; ##TABLE_END

In certain cases, we participate in securities finance transactions as a principal. As a principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. Our right to receive and obligation to return collateral in connection with our securities lending transactions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had approximately $ 18.33 billion and $ 18.52 billion, respectively, of collateral provided and approximately $ 9.36 billion and $ 10.77 billion, respectively, of collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions. 

Stable Value Protection 

Stable value funds wrapped by us are high quality diversified portfolios of short intermediate duration fixed-income investments. Stable value contracts are derivative contracts that also qualify as guarantees. The notional amount under non-hedging derivatives, provided in Note 10, generally represents our maximum exposure under these derivatives contracts. However, exposure to various stable value contracts is contractually limited to substantially lower amounts than the notional values, which represent the total assets of the stable value funds. 

Standby Letters of Credit 

Standby letters of credit provide credit enhancement to our municipal clients to support the issuance of capital markets financing.

Note 13. Contingencies 

Legal and Regulatory Matters 

In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in disputes, litigation, and governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, both pending and threatened. These matters, if resolved adversely against us or settled, may result in monetary awards or payments, fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices. The resolution or settlement of these matters is inherently difficult to predict. Based on our assessment of these pending matters, we do not believe that the amount of any judgment, settlement or other action arising from any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, an adverse outcome or development in certain of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such matter is resolved, or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition, or on our reputation. 

We evaluate our needs for accruals of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings on a case-by-case basis. When we have a liability that we deem probable, and we deem the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated as of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we accrue our estimate of the amount of loss. We also consider a loss probable and establish an accrual when we make, or intend to make, an offer of settlement. Once established, an accrual is subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of additional information. The resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and the amount of reasonably estimable loss (or range thereof) are inherently difficult to predict, especially in the early stages of proceedings. Even if a loss is probable, an amount (or range) of loss might not be reasonably estimated until the later stages of the proceeding due to many factors such as the presence of complex or novel legal theories, the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiating resolutions in civil and criminal matters, the pace and timing of discovery and other assessments of facts and the procedural posture of the matter (collectively, "factors influencing reasonable estimates"). 

As of December 31, 2020, our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal, regulatory and related matters totaled approximately $ 144 million, including potential fines by government agencies and civil litigation with respect to the matters specifically discussed below. To the extent that we have established accruals in our consolidated statement of condition for probable loss contingencies, such accruals may not be sufficient to 

cover our ultimate financial exposure associated with any settlements or judgments. Any such ultimate financial exposure, or proceedings to which we may become subject in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. 

As of December 31, 2020, for those matters for which we have accrued probable loss contingencies (including the Invoicing Matter described below) and for other matters for which loss is reasonably possible (but not probable) in future periods, and for which we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, our estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss (in excess of any accrued amounts) ranges up to approximately $ 40 million. Our estimate with respect to the aggregate reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties, which may change quickly and significantly from time to time, particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental agencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding. Also, the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time. As a result, actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. 

In certain pending matters, it is not currently feasible to reasonably estimate the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, and such losses, which may be significant, are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above. This is due to, among other factors, the factors influencing reasonable estimates described above. An adverse outcome in one or more of the matters for which we have not estimated the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. Given that our actual losses from any legal or regulatory proceeding for which we have provided an estimate of the reasonably possible loss could significantly exceed such estimate, and given that we cannot estimate reasonably possible loss for all legal and regulatory proceedings as to which we may be subject now or in the future, no conclusion as to our ultimate exposure from current pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings should be drawn from the current estimate of reasonably possible loss. 

The following discussion provides information with respect to significant legal, governmental and regulatory matters. 

Invoicing Matter 

In 2015, we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses. We have 

State Street Corporation | 167 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

reimbursed most of our affected customers for those expenses, and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes. In connection with our enhancements to our billing processes, we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation. In 2017, we identified an additional area of incorrect expense billing associated with mailing services in our retirement services business. We currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors, including the error in the retirement services business, to be at least $ 370 million, all of which has been paid or is accrued. However, we may identify additional remediation costs. 

In March 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In addition, we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under Massachusetts law. A class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under Massachusetts law. 

We are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the DOJ and the DOL, which reviews could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. In June 2019, we reached an agreement with the SEC to settle its claims that we violated the recordkeeping provisions of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and caused violations of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 31a-1(a) and 31a-1(b) thereunder in connection with our overcharges of customers which are registered investment companies. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims contained in the SEC&#8217;s order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $ 40 million. Also in June 2019, we reached an agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General&#8217;s office to resolve its claims related to this matter. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims in the order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $ 5.5 million. The costs associated with these settlements were within our related previously established accruals for loss contingencies. The SEC and Massachusetts Attorney General&#8217;s office settlements both recognize that the payment of $ 48.8 million in disgorgement and interest is satisfied by our direct reimbursements of our customers. 

In January 2020, the DOJ outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review. We are discussing the terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the DOJ. Separately, we have inquired of the DOL as to the status of their review but have not entered into settlement discussions with the DOL. There can be no assurance that any settlement with the DOJ or DOL will be reached on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all. The aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices is not currently known. We have established a legal accrual with respect to the pending governmental investigations and civil litigation with respect to this matter, however, our ultimate liability with respect to this matter might be significantly in excess of our current accrual. Government authorities have significant discretion in criminal and civil matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose. Any resolution of the DOJ and DOL claims may involve penalties that could be a significant percentage, or a multiple of, all or a portion of the overcharge. The severity of such fines or penalties could take into account factors such as the amount or duration of our incorrect invoicing and the government&#8217;s or regulators&#8217; assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our January 2017 deferred prosecution agreement and settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect FX business. 

The outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant additional consequences for our business and reputation. 

Federal Reserve/Massachusetts Division of Banks Written Agreement 

On June 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. As part of this enforcement action, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks terminated the written agreement, based on our compliance with its requirements. 

Shareholder Litigation 

A shareholder of ours has filed a derivative complaint against the Company&#8217;s past and present officers and directors to recover alleged losses

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

incurred by the Company relating to the invoicing matter and to the Ohio public retirement plans matter. 

Income Taxes 

In determining our provision for income taxes, we make certain judgments and interpretations with respect to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business operations. Because of the complex nature of these laws, in the normal course of our business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. income tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions. We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not that our position will result in a tax deduction or credit. Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 308 million as of December 31, 2020 increased from $ 149 million as of December 31, 2019. 

We are presently under audit by a number of tax authorities, and the Internal Revenue Service is currently reviewing our U.S. income tax returns, including amended returns, for tax years 2014-2018. The earliest tax year open to examination in jurisdictions where we have material operations is 2013. Management believes that we have sufficiently accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020 for potential tax exposures. 

Note 14. Variable Interest Entities 

We are involved, in the normal course of our business, with various types of special purpose entities, some of which meet the definition of VIEs. When evaluating a VIE for consolidation, we must determine whether or not we have a variable interest in the entity. Variable interests are investments or other interests that absorb portions of an entity&#8217;s expected losses or receive portions of the entity&#8217;s expected returns. If it is determined that we do not have a variable interest in the VIE, no further analysis is required and we do not consolidate the VIE. If we hold a variable interest in a VIE, we are required by U.S. GAAP to consolidate that VIE when we have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We are determined to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. This determination is evaluated periodically as facts and circumstances change. 

Asset-Backed Investment Securities 

We invest in various forms of ABS, which we carry in our investment securities portfolio. These ABS meet the U.S. GAAP definition of asset securitization entities, which are considered to be VIEs. We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since we do not have control over their activities. Additional information about our ABS is provided in Note 3. 

Tax-Exempt Investment Program 

In the normal course of our business, we structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax-exempt investment grade assets, principally to our mutual fund clients. We structure these pools as partnership trusts, and the assets and liabilities of the trusts are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as AFS investment securities and other short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we carried AFS investment securities, composed of securities related to state and political subdivisions, with a fair value of $ 0.70 billion and $ 0.94 billion, respectively, and other short-term borrowings of $ 0.62 billion and $ 0.82 billion, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition in connection with these trusts. The interest income and interest expense generated by the investments and certificated interests, respectively, are recorded as components of NII when earned or incurred. 

We transfer assets to the trusts from our investment securities portfolio at adjusted book value, and the trusts finance the acquisition of these assets by selling certificated interests issued by the trust to third-party investors and to us as residual holder. These transfers do not meet the de-recognition criteria defined by U.S. GAAP, and therefore, the assets continue to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The trusts had a weighted-average life of approximately 2.7 years as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 3.0 years as of December 31, 2019. 

State Street Corporation | 169 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Under separate legal agreements, we provide liquidity facilities to these trusts and, with respect to certain securities, letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, our commitments to the trusts under these liquidity facilities and/or letters of credit totaled $ 0.62 billion, and neither of the liquidity facilities nor letters of credit were utilized. In the event that our obligations under these liquidity facilities are triggered, no material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition is expected to occur, because the securities are already recorded at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition, neither creditors or third-party investors in the trusts have any recourse to our general credit other than through the liquidity facilities and letters of credit noted above. 

Interests in Investment Funds 

In the normal course of business, we manage various types of investment funds through State Street Global Advisors in which our clients are investors, including State Street Global Advisors commingled investment vehicles and other similar investment structures. The majority of our AUM are contained within such funds. The services we provide to these funds generate management fee revenue. From time to time, we may invest cash in the funds in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly-launched strategies, referred to as seed capital, or for other purposes. 

With respect to our interests in funds that meet the definition of a VIE, a primary beneficiary assessment is performed to determine if we have a controlling financial interest. As part of our assessment, we consider all the facts and circumstances regarding the terms and characteristics of the variable interest(s), the design and characteristics of the fund and the other involvements of the enterprise with the fund. Upon consolidation of certain funds, we retain the specialized investment company accounting rules followed by the underlying funds. 

All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments&#8217; fair values reflected in foreign exchange trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. When we no longer control these funds due to a 

reduced ownership interest or other reasons, the funds are de-consolidated and accounted for under another accounting method if we continue to maintain investments in the funds. 

As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $ 17 million and $ 4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $ 21 million and $ 5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our maximum total exposure associated with the consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $ 13 million and $ 15 million, respectively, and represented the value of our economic ownership interest in the funds. 

Our conclusion to consolidate a fund may vary from period to period, most commonly as a result of fluctuation in our ownership interest as a result of changes in the number of fund shares held by either us or by third parties. Given that the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value, a de-consolidation generally would not result in gains or losses for us. 

The net assets of any consolidated fund are solely available to settle the liabilities of the fund and to settle any investors&#8217; ownership redemption requests, including any seed capital invested in the fund by us. We are not contractually required to provide financial or any other support to any of our funds. In addition, neither creditors nor equity investors in the funds have any recourse to our general credit. 

As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we managed certain funds, considered VIEs, in which we held a variable interest but for which we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Our potential maximum loss exposure related to these unconsolidated funds totaled $ 22 million and $ 21 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and represented the carrying value of our investments, which are recorded in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition. The amount of loss we may recognize during any period is limited to the carrying amount of our investments in the unconsolidated funds.

Common Stock 

In June 2019, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased $ 500 million of our common stock in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program. On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2020. 

In June 2020, concurrent with the release of the CCAR 2020 results, the Federal Reserve announced that all CCAR banks were required to resubmit their capital plan and stress test results based on scenarios to be provided in September 2020. Scenarios were provided on September 17, 2020 with materials due on November 2, 2020. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $ 475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021. 

In June 2018, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $ 1.2 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019 (the 2018 Program). We repurchased $ 300 million of our common stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2019 under the 2018 Program.

Note 16. Regulatory Capital 

We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Under current regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specified capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of our consolidated assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures calculated in conformity with regulatory accounting practices. Our capital components and their classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor" in the calculation and assessment of regulatory capital adequacy by U.S. banking regulators. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we were required to calculate our risk- based capital ratios using both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach. As a result, from January 1, 2015 going forward, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. 

The methods for the calculation of our and State Street Bank's risk-based capital ratios have changed as the provisions of the Basel III rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (RWA) were phased in, and as we calculated our RWA using the advanced approaches. These ongoing methodological changes have resulted in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile. 

As of December 31, 2020, we and State Street Bank exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. As of December 31, 2020, State Street Bank was categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy framework, and exceeded all &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; ratio guidelines to which it was subject. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2020 that have changed the capital categorization of State Street Bank. 

The following table presents the regulatory capital structure, total RWA, related regulatory capital ratios and the minimum required regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. As a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period as the provisions of the Basel III rule were phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period-end are not directly comparable. Refer to the footnotes following the table.

(3) Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.

Note 18. Equity-Based Compensation 

We record compensation expense for equity-based awards, such as deferred stock and performance awards, based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted if appropriate, based on the eligibility of the award to receive dividends. 

Compensation expense related to equity-based awards with service-only conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period for the entire award. Compensation expense related to equity-based awards with performance conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award, and is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions at each reporting date. Compensation expense is adjusted for assumptions with respect to the estimated amount of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting, and for employees who have met certain retirement eligibility criteria. Compensation expense for common stock awards granted to employees meeting early retirement eligibility criteria is fully expensed on the grant date. 

Dividend equivalents for certain equity-based awards are paid on stock units on a current basis prior to vesting and distribution. 

The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2017 Plan, was approved by shareholders in May 2017 for issuance of stock and stock based awards. Awards may be made under the 2017 Plan for (i) up to 8.3 million shares of common stock plus (ii) up to an additional 28.5 million shares that were available to be issued under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2006 Plan, or may become available for issuance under the 2006 Plan due to expiration, termination, cancellation, forfeiture or repurchase of awards granted under the 2006 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 20.5 million shares from the 2006 Plan have been added to and may be issued from the 2017 Plan. 

The following table presents the cumulative total number of shares that was awarded under the 2017 Plan and the 2006 Plan for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START As of December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total number of shares awarded under the 2006 Plan 68.9 &#160; 68.9 &#160; 68.9 &#160; Total number of shares awarded under the 2017 Plan 11.3 &#160; 7.6 &#160; 3.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The 2017 Plan allows for shares withheld in payment of the exercise price of an award or in satisfaction of tax withholding requirements, shares forfeited due to employee termination, shares expired under option awards, or shares not delivered when performance conditions have not been met, to be added back to the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. From inception to December 31, 2020, 1.7 million shares had been awarded under the 2017 Plan but not delivered, and have become available for re-issue. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 19.2 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. 

For deferred stock awards granted under the Plans, no common stock is issued at the time of grant and the award does not possess dividend and voting rights. Generally, these grants vest over one to four years . Performance awards granted are earned over a performance period based on the achievement of defined goals, generally over three years . Payment for performance awards is made in shares of our common stock equal to its fair market value per share, based on the performance of certain financial ratios, after the conclusion of each performance period. 

Beginning with 2012, malus-based forfeiture provisions were included in deferred stock awards granted to employees identified as &#8220;material risk-takers,&#8221; as defined by management. These malus-

based forfeiture provisions provide for the reduction or cancellation of unvested deferred compensation, such as deferred stock awards and performance based awards, if it is determined that a material risk-taker made risk-based decisions that exposed us to inappropriate risks that resulted in a material unexpected loss at the business-unit, line-of-business or corporate level. In addition, awards granted to certain of our senior executives, as well as awards granted to individuals in certain jurisdictions, may be subject to recoupment after vesting (if applicable) and delivery to the individual in specified circumstances generally relating to fraud or willful misconduct by the individual that results in material harm to us or a material financial restatement. 

Compensation expense related to deferred stock awards and performance awards, which we record as a component of compensation and employee benefits expense in our consolidated statement of income, was $ 240 million, $ 235 million and $ 262 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Such expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 excluded an expense of $ 29 million, a release of $ 4 million and an expense of $ 45 million, respectively, associated with acceleration of expense in connection with targeted staff reductions. This expense was included in the severance-related portion of the associated restructuring or repositioning charges recorded in each respective year. 

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no stock appreciation rights were exercised. As of December 31, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock appreciation rights.

We utilize either treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares to satisfy the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans. We do not have a specific policy concerning purchases of our common stock to satisfy stock issuances. We have a general policy concerning purchases of our common stock to meet issuances under our employee benefit plans, including other corporate purposes. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our purchases of our common stock, including regulatory reviews and approvals or non-objections, our regulatory capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue under employee benefit plans, market conditions (including the trading price of our common stock), and legal considerations. These factors can change at any time, and the number of shares of common stock we will purchase or when we will purchase them cannot be assured. Additional information on our common stock purchase program is provided in Note 15.

Note 19. Employee Benefits 

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 

State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The U.S. defined benefit pension plan was frozen as of December 31, 2007 and no new employees were eligible to participate after that date. We have agreed to contribute sufficient amounts as necessary to meet the benefits paid to plan participants and to fund the plan&#8217;s service cost, plus interest. U.S. employee account balances earn annual interest credits until the employee begins receiving benefits. Non-U.S. employees participate in local defined benefit plans which are funded as required in each local jurisdiction. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, we have non-qualified unfunded SERPs that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits. State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a post-retirement plan that provides health care benefits for certain retired employees. The total expense for these tax-qualified and non-qualified plans was $ 25 million, $ 8 million and $ 11 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, in the consolidated statement of position. The assets held by the defined benefit pension plans are largely made up of common, collective funds that are liquid and invest principally in U.S. equities and high-quality fixed-income investments. The majority of these assets fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The benefit obligations associated with our primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans, non-qualified unfunded supplemental retirement plans and post-retirement plans were $ 1.53 billion, $ 69 million and $ 4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $ 1.37 billion, $ 88 million and $ 10 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. As the primary defined benefit plans are frozen, the benefit obligation will only vary over time as a result of changes in market interest rates, the life expectancy of the plan participants and payments made from the plans. The primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $ 15 million and overfunded by $ 10 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The non-qualified supplemental retirement plans were underfunded by $ 69 million and $ 88 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $ 4 million and $ 10 million as of 

December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The underfunded status is included in other liabilities. 

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans 

We contribute to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans. Our contribution to these plans was $ 168 million, $ 167 million and $ 170 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Note 20. Occupancy Expense and Information Systems and Communications Expense 

Upon adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, we recognized right-of-use assets of approximately $ 0.91 billion and lease liabilities of approximately $ 1.06 billion. 

Occupancy expense and information systems and communications expense include depreciation of buildings, leasehold improvements, computer hardware and software, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of lease right-of-use assets. Total depreciation and amortization expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 858 million, $ 842 million and $ 599 million, respectively. We recorded a repositioning charge of $ 51 million in occupancy expenses in 2020, consisting of a $ 46 million impairment of right-of-use assets and consisting of $ 5 million for one-time repairs. 

We use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for finance and operating leases described below. Additionally, we do not separate nonlease components such as real estate taxes and common area maintenance from base lease payments. 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate net book value of $ 55 million and $ 78 million, respectively, for the finance lease related to our One Lincoln Street Boston headquarters was recorded in premises and equipment, with the related liability of $ 103 million and $ 136 million, respectively, recorded in long-term debt, in our consolidated statement of condition. 

Finance lease right-of-use asset amortization is recorded in occupancy expense on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statement of income over the respective lease term. As of December 31, 2020, accumulated amortization of the finance lease right-of-use asset was $ 75 million. Lease payments are recorded as a reduction of the liability, with a portion recorded as imputed interest expense. In 2020 and 2019, interest expense related to the finance lease obligation reflected in NII was $ 9 million and $ 11 million, respectively. 

As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate net book value of $ 720 million for the operating lease right-of-use assets is recorded in other assets, with the related lease liability of $ 891 million recorded in

accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition. 

We have entered into non-cancellable operating leases for premises and equipment. Nearly all of these leases include renewal options, and only those reasonably certain of being exercised are included in the term of the lease. Costs for operating leases are recorded on a straight-line basis which includes both interest expense and right-of-use asset amortization. Operating lease costs for office space are recorded in occupancy expense. Costs related to operating leases for equipment are recorded in information systems and communications expense. 

As of December 31, 2020, we have additional operating leases, primarily for office space, that have not yet commenced of approximately $ 462 million of undiscounted future minimum lease payments. These leases will commence between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 10 to 15 years. The majority of these future payments relate to the new Boston headquarters lease executed in the first quarter of 2019, replacing the One Lincoln Street Boston property. 

None of our leases contain residual value guarantees.

Restructuring and Repositioning Charges 

Repositioning Charges 

In 2020, we recorded $ 133 million of repositioning charges, including $ 82 million of compensation and employee benefits and $ 51 million of occupancy expenses, to further drive automation of processes and organizational simplification enabling workforce rationalization and to reduce our real estate footprint by approximately 13 % of our total square footage. 

In 2019, we recorded $ 110 million of repositioning charges, including $ 98 million of compensation and employee benefits expenses and $ 12 million of occupancy costs, to further drive process automation, information technology optimizations and organization rationalization in 2020.

Note 22. Income Taxes 

We use an asset-and-liability approach to account for income taxes. Our objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year through charges or credits to the current tax provision, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates. The effects of a tax position on our consolidated financial statements are recognized 

when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. A valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statement of condition are netted within the same tax jurisdiction. 

The following table presents the components of income tax expense (benefit) for the periods indicated: &#160;

As of December 31, 2018, the accounting for income tax effects of the TCJA was completed and the 2018 income tax expense included an additional deferred tax benefit of approximately $ 32 million. 

Beginning in 2018, the TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiarie s. We have elected to recognize our tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. As such, we have included an estimate of this liability in our estimated annual effective tax rate. This adjustment increased our effective tax rate by

0.2 %, 0.3 % and 0.2 % in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is reflected in the prior reconciliation table under "Foreign Tax Credit (Benefits)/Limitations". 

Undistributed indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $ 5.8 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result, no provision has been recorded for state and local or foreign withholding income taxes. If a distribution were to occur, we would be subject to state, local and to foreign withholding tax. It is expected that any distribution will be exempt from federal income tax. Although the foreign withholding tax is generally creditable against U.S. federal income tax, certain credit utilization limitations may result in a net cost.

The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized as of December 31, 2020: 

##TABLE_START (In millions) Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Expiration Other amortizable assets $ 385 &#160; $ ( 233 ) __ Tax credits 564 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2038-2040 NOLs - Non-U.S. 65 &#160; ( 40 ) 2026-2031, None Other carryforwards 19 &#160; ( 5 ) None NOLs - State 17 &#160; ( 17 ) 2021-2040 ##TABLE_END

Management considers the valuation allowance adequate to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an aggregate amount that will more likely than not be realized. Management has determined that a 

valuation allowance is not required for the remaining deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income of the appropriate nature within the carryforward periods to realize these assets. 

At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, were $ 308 million, $ 149 million and $ 108 million, respectively. Of this, the amounts that would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, are $ 294 million, $ 140 million and $ 100 million, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate includes the federal benefit for unrecognized state tax benefits. 

The following table presents activity related to unrecognized tax benefits as of the dates indicated: 

##TABLE_START December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 149 &#160; $ 108 &#160; $ 94 &#160; Decrease related to agreements with tax authorities &#8212; &#160; ( 17 ) ( 40 ) Increase related to tax positions taken during current year 47 &#160; 13 &#160; 12 &#160; Increase related to tax positions taken during prior years 137 &#160; 49 &#160; 44 &#160; Decreases related to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 25 ) ( 4 ) ( 2 ) Ending balance $ 308 &#160; $ 149 &#160; $ 108 &#160; ##TABLE_END 

It is reasonably possible that of the $ 308 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, up to $ 104 million could decrease within the next 12 months due to the resolution of various audits. Management believes that we have sufficient accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020 for tax exposures and related interest expense. 

Income tax expense included related interest and penalties of approximately $ 6 million, $ 5 million and $ 1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties were approximately $ 14 million, $ 10 million and $ 8 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Note 23. Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the total weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of equity-based awards. The effect of equity-based awards is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in periods in which their effect would be anti-dilutive.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The two-class method requires the allocation of undistributed net income between common and participating shareholders. Net income available to common shareholders, presented separately in our consolidated statement of income, is the basis for the calculation of both basic and diluted EPS. Participating securities are composed of unvested and fully vested SERP shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings. 

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the periods indicated:

Note 24. Line of Business Information 

Our operations are organized into two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided. The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. 

Investment Servicing, through State Street Institutional Services, State Street Global Markets, State Street Global Exchange and CRD, provides services for U.S. mutual funds, collective investment 

funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations and endowments worldwide. Products include: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. 

Included within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers. 

Investment Management , through State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR &#174; ETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Our investment servicing strategy is to focus on total client relationships and the full integration of our products and services across our client base through cross-selling opportunities. In general, our clients will use a combination of services, depending on their needs, rather than one product or service. For instance, a custody client may purchase securities finance and cash management services from different business units. Products and services that we provide to our clients are parts of an integrated offering to these clients. We price our products and services on the basis of overall client relationships and other factors; as a result, revenue may not necessarily reflect the stand-alone market price of these products and services within the business lines in the same way it would for separate business entities. 

Our servicing and management fee revenue from the Investment Servicing and Investment Management business lines, including foreign exchange trading services and securities finance activities, represents approximately 70 % to 80 % of our consolidated total revenue. The remaining 20 % to 30 % is composed of software and processing fees, including CRD, as well as NII, which is largely generated by our investment of client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in a variety of assets, and net gains (losses) related to investment securities. These other revenue types are generally fully allocated to, or reside in, Investment Servicing and Investment Management. 

Revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to our lines of business through management information systems. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to policies that support management&#8217;s strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based on the relative risks and capital requirements inherent in each business line, along with management judgment. Capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were separate business entities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 25. Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

We account for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018. The amount of revenue that we recognize is measured based on the consideration specified in contracts with our customers, and excludes taxes collected from customers subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. We recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied over time as the services are performed or at a point in time depending on the nature of the services provided as further discussed below. Revenue recognition guidance related to contracts with customers excludes our NII, revenue earned on security lending transactions entered into as principal, realized gains/losses on securities, revenue earned on foreign exchange activity, loans and related fees, and gains/losses on hedging and derivatives, to which we apply other applicable U.S. GAAP guidance. 

For contracts with multiple performance obligations, or contracts that have been combined, we allocate the contracts' transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price. Our contractual fees are negotiated on a customer by customer basis and are representative of standalone selling price utilized for allocating revenue when there are multiple performance obligations. 

Substantially all of our services are provided as a distinct series of daily performance obligations that the customer simultaneously benefits from as they are performed. Payments may be made to third party service providers and the expense is recognized gross when we control those services as we are deemed the principal. 

Contract durations may vary from short to long- term or may be open ended. Termination notice periods are in line with general market practice and typically do not include termination penalties. Therefore, for substantially all of our revenues, the duration of the contract and the enforceable rights and obligations do not extend beyond the services that are performed daily or at the transaction level. In instances where we have substantive termination penalties, the duration of the contract may extend through the date of substantive termination penalties. 

Investment Servicing 

Revenue from contracts with customers related to servicing fees is recognized over time as our customers benefit from the custody, administration, accounting, transfer agency and other related asset services as they are performed. At contract inception, no revenue is estimated as the fees are dependent on assets under custody and/or administration and/or actual transactions which are susceptible to market factors outside of our control. Therefore, revenue is recognized using a time-based output method as the customers benefit from the services over time and as the assets under custody or transactions are known or determinable during each reporting period based on contractual fee schedules. Payments made to third party service providers, such as sub-custodians, are generally recognized gross as we control those services and are deemed to be a principal in such arrangements. 

Foreign exchange trading services revenue includes revenue generated from providing access and use of electronic trading platforms and other trading, transition management and brokerage services. Electronic FX services are dependent on the volume of actual transactions initiated through our electronic exchange platforms. Revenue is recognized over time using a time-based measure as access to, and use of, the electronic exchange platforms is made available to the customer and the activity is determinable. Revenue related to other trading, transition management and brokerage services is recognized when the customer obtains the benefit of such services which may be over time or at a point in time upon trade execution. 

Securities finance revenue is related to services for providing agency lending programs to State Street Global Advisors managed investment funds and third- party investment managers and asset owners. This securities finance revenue is recognized over time using a time-based measure as our customers benefit from these lending services over time. 

Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of licenses and software as service arrangements, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Revenue for a sale of software to be installed on premise is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement is recognized over time as services are provided. 

Investment Management 

Revenue from contracts with customers related to investment management, investment research and investment advisory services provided through State Street Global Advisors is recognized over time as our customers benefit from the services as they are performed. Substantially all of our investment management fees are determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategies employed. At contract inception, no revenue is estimated as the fees are dependent on assets under management which are susceptible to market factors outside of our control. 

State Street Corporation | 184 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Therefore, substantially all of our Investment Management services revenue is recognized using a time-based output method as the customers benefit from the services over time and as the assets under management are known or determinable during each reporting period based on contractual fee schedules. Payments made to third party service providers, such as payments to others in unitary fee arrangements, are generally recognized on a gross basis when State Street Global Advisors controls those services and is deemed to be a principal in such transactions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

No adjustments are made to the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between when we transfer a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is expected to be one year or less. 

Note 26. Non-U.S. Activities 

We define our non-U.S. activities as those revenue-producing business activities that arise from clients which are generally serviced or managed outside the U.S. Due to the integrated nature of our business, precise segregation of our U.S. and non-U.S. activities is not possible. 

Subjective estimates, assumptions and other judgments are applied to quantify the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities, including our application of funds transfer pricing, our asset and liability management policies and our allocation of certain indirect corporate expenses. Management periodically reviews and updates its processes for quantifying the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities. 

The following table presents our U.S. and non-U.S. financial results for the periods indicated:

(1) Fully taxable-equivalent revenue is a method of presentation in which the tax savings achieved by investing in tax-exempt investment securities and certain leases are included in interest income with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. This method facilitates the comparison of the performance of these assets. The adjustments are computed using a federal income tax rate of 21 % for periods ending in 2018, 2019 and 2020, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The fully taxable-equivalent adjustments included in interest income presented above were $17 million, $19 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were substantially related to tax-exempt securities (state and political subdivisions).

##TABLE_START GLOSSARY 

Asset-backed securities: A financial security backed by collateralized assets, other than real estate or mortgage backed securities. Assets under custody and/or administration: Assets that we hold directly or indirectly on behalf of clients under a safekeeping or custody arrangement or for which we provide administrative services for clients. To the extent that we provide more than one AUC/A service (including back and middle office services) for a client&#8217;s assets, the value of the asset is only counted once in the total amount of AUC/A. Assets under management: The total market value of client assets for which we provide investment management strategy services, advisory services and/or distribution services generating management fees based on a percentage of the assets&#8217; market values. These client assets are not included on our balance sheet. Assets under management include managed assets lost but not liquidated. Lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets as the timing can vary significantly. 

Beacon: A multi-year program, announced in October 2015, to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients. Certificates of deposit: A savings certificate with a fixed maturity date, specified fixed interest rate and can be issued in any denomination aside from minimum investment requirements. A CD restricts access to the funds until the maturity date of the investment. Collateralized loan obligations: A security backed by a pool of debt, primarily senior secured leveraged loans. CLOs are similar to collateralized mortgage obligations, except for the different type of underlying loan. With a CLO, the investor receives scheduled debt payments from the underlying loans, assuming most of the risk in the event borrowers default, but is offered greater diversity and the potential for higher-than-average returns. Commercial real estate: Property intended to generate profit from capital gains or rental income. CRE loans are term loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties. We seek CRE loans with strong competitive positions in major domestic markets, stable cash flows, modest leverage and experienced institutional ownership. Deposit beta: A measure of how much of an interest rate increase is expected to be passed on to client interest-bearing accounts, on average. Depot bank: A German term, specified by the country's law on investment companies, which essentially corresponds to 'custodian'. Doubtful: Doubtful loans and leases meet the same definition of substandard loans and leases (i.e., well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment with the possibility that we will sustain some loss) with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. Economic value of equity: A measure designed to estimate the fair value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments based on a discounted cash flow model. Exchange-Traded Fund: A type of exchange-traded investment product that offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets and, in return, to receive an interest in that investment pool. ETF shares are traded on a national stock exchange and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value. Exposure-at-default: A measure used in the calculation of regulatory capital under Basel III. It can be defined as the expected amount of loss a bank may be exposed to upon default of an obligor. Global systemically important bank: A financial institution whose distress or disorderly failure, because of its size, complexity and systemic interconnectedness, would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity, which will be subject to additional capital requirements. Held-to-maturity investment securities: We classify investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity only if we have the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are measured subsequently at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. 

High-quality liquid assets: Cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets and are considered unencumbered. Investment grade: A rating of loans and leases to counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. It applies to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment. Liquidity coverage ratio: The ratio of encumbered high-quality liquid assets divided by expected total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. A Basel III framework requirement for banks and bank holding companies to measure liquidity, it is designed to ensure that certain banking institutions, including us, maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day stress period. Net asset value: The amount of net assets attributable to each share/unit of the fund at a specific date or time. Net stable funding ratio: The ratio of the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding. This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. Other-than-temporary-impairment: Impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below its carrying value on balance sheet and its value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security. Probability of default: A measure of the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status. Qualified financial contracts: Securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and any other contract determined by the FDIC to be a qualified financial contract. Risk-weighted assets: A measurement used to quantify risk inherent in our on and off-balance sheet assets by adjusting the asset value for risk. RWA is used in the calculation of our risk-based capital ratios. Special mention: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects. Speculative: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties that face ongoing uncertainties or exposure to business, financial, or economic downturns. However, these counterparties may have financial flexibility or access to financial alternatives, which allow for financial commitments to be met. Substandard: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss. Supplementary leverage ratio: The ratio of our tier 1 capital to our total leverage exposure, which measures our capital adequacy relative to our on and off-balance sheet assets. Total loss-absorbing capacity: The sum of our tier 1 regulatory capital plus eligible external long-term debt issued by us. Value-at-Risk: Statistical model used to measure the potential loss in value of a portfolio that could occur in normal markets condition, over a defined holding period, within a certain confidence level. Variable interest entity: An entity that: (1) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties; (2) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity&#8217;s operations; and/or (3) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb or the right to receive the entity&#8217;s losses or return.
