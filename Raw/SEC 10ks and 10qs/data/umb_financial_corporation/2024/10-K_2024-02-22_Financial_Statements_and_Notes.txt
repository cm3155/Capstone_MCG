 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

UMB Financial Corporation: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UMB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Allowance for credit losses on certain loans evaluated on a collective basis 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s total allowance for credit losses on loans was $219.7 million as of December 31, 2023, a substantial portion of which related to the allowance for credit losses for loans evaluated on a collective basis for the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments (the collective ACL). The collective ACL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a pool basis for loans where similar risk characteristics exist and is determined using relevant available information from internal and external sources related to historical credit loss experience, current 

&#160; 

conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The Company uses probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) models for the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments. For the commercial and industrial segment, the collective ACL is calculated by modeling PD over future periods multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any modeled prepayments and charge offs. For the commercial real estate segment, the collective ACL is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data. The PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any modeled prepayments and charge offs. Primary risk drivers are segment specific and include macro-economic variables and risk ratings of the individual loans within the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan segments. After the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, the Company reverts to historical loss experience for each portfolio using a cliff or straight-line reversion method. A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative factors which represent adjustments to historical loss experience. 

We identified the assessment of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and historical loss rates and their significant assumptions, including average prepayment rates, the economic forecast scenario, macro-economic variables, the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, lengths of time and methods of reversion, and risk ratings, and (2) the qualitative factors and their significant assumptions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the collective ACL, including controls related to the: 

&#8226; design of the collective ACL methodology 

&#8226; continued use of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models 

&#8226; determination and measurement of the significant assumptions used in the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models 

&#8226; continued use of the qualitative factors 

&#8226; performance monitoring of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models 

&#8226; analysis of the overall ACL results, trends, and ratios. 

We evaluated the Company&#8217;s process to develop the collective ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 

&#8226; evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the continued use and performance monitoring of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models by comparing them to relevant Company specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 

&#8226; assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use 

&#8226; evaluating the methodology used to develop the economic forecast scenario and underlying assumptions by comparing it to the Company&#8217;s business environment and relevant industry practices 

&#8226; testing the historical credit cycle period and evaluating the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends 

&#160; 

&#8226; testing individual risk ratings for a selection of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral 

&#8226; evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

&#160; 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

UMB Financial Corporation is a bank holding company, which offers a wide range of banking and other financial services to its customers through its branches and offices in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana, Utah, Minnesota, California, Wisconsin, Delaware, and New York. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies to assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation. 

Consolidation 

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements (references hereinafter to the Company in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include wholly owned subsidiaries). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Revenue Recognition 

Interest on loans and securities is recognized based on rate multiplied by the principal amount outstanding. This includes the impact of amortization of premiums and discounts. Interest accrual is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful. Noninterest income is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include Cash and due from banks and amounts due from the FRB. Cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks are included in Cash and due from banks. Amounts due from the FRB are interest-bearing for all periods presented and are included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

This table provides a summary of cash and cash equivalents as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands) :

Also included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line, but not considered cash and cash equivalents are interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions, which totaled $ 78.7 million and $ 121.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. 

Loans and Loans Held for Sale 

Loans are classified by the portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, specialty lending, commercial real estate, consumer real estate, consumer, credit cards, and leases and other. 

A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is collateral dependent, the Company records a valuation allowance equal to the carrying amount of the loan in excess of the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective rate, based on the loan&#8217;s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral. 

&#160; 

A loan is accounted for as a modification made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty when a modification has been granted that is deemed concessionary and not temporary to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty. The Company&#8217;s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered to be collateral dependent and is evaluated for credit loss as part of the allowance for credit loss analysis. 

Loans, including those that are considered to be collateral dependent, are evaluated regularly by management. Loans are considered delinquent when payment has not been received within 30 days of its contractual due date. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal is 90 days or more past due unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal unless the remaining principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible. 

The adequacy of the ACL on loans is based on management&#8217;s judgment and continuous evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio. Consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to each specific segmentation of loans includes lifetime historical loss experience, the impact of the current economic environment, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and detailed analysis of loans determined to be collateral dependent. The actual losses incurred over the lifetime of the portfolio, notwithstanding such considerations, however, could differ from the amounts estimated by management. 

The Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures, to address the credit risk to which the Company is exposed via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is included in the Accrued expenses and taxes line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In order to maintain the allowance for off-balance sheet items at an appropriate level, a provision to increase or reduce the allowance is included in the Provision for credit losses line item in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit loss rates to the expected amount to be funded. 

Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Loan fees (net of certain direct loan origination costs) on loans held for sale are deferred until the related loans are sold or repaid. Gains or losses on loan sales are recognized at the time of sale and determined using the specific identification method. 

Securities 

Debt securities available for sale principally include U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, GSE mortgage-backed securities, certain securities of state and political subdivisions, corporates, and collateralized loan obligations. Debt securities classified as available for sale are measured at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in AOCI until realized. 

Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized historical cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, based on management&#8217;s intention, and the Company&#8217;s ability to hold them to maturity. The Company classifies certain U.S. Agency securities, GSE mortgage-backed securities, and securities of state and political subdivisions as held to maturity. 

Trading securities, acquired for subsequent sale to customers, are carried at fair value. Market adjustments, fees and gains or losses on the sale of trading securities are considered to be a normal part of operations and are included in trading and investment banking income. 

Securities may be transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Transfers of securities are made at fair value at the time of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the time of transfer is retained in AOCI and amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the transferred securities. No gains or losses are recognized at the time of the transfer. 

&#160; 

Equity-method investments 

The Company accounts for certain other investments using equity-method accounting. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. When transparency in pricing exists, other investments are considered equity securities with readily determinable fair values. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles 

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company performs a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit. If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required. Otherwise, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying amounts to determine if an impairment exists and the amount of impairment loss. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill over its fair value. 

No goodwill impairments were recognized in 2023, 2022, or 2021 . Other intangible assets, which relate to core deposits, non-compete agreements, and customer relationships, are amortized over their useful life. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances dictate. No intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2023, 2022, or 2021 . The Company does no t have any indefinite lived intangible assets. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is computed primarily on the straight-line method. Premises are depreciated over 15 to 40 year lives, while equipment is depreciated over lives of 3 to 20 years . Gains and losses from the sale of Premises and equipment are included in Other noninterest income and Other noninterest expense, respectively. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets, including Premises and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets to their current carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value. No impairments were recognized in 2023, 2022, or 2021 . 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The provision for deferred income taxes represents the change in the deferred income tax accounts during the year excluding the tax effect of the change in net unrealized gain (loss) on securities available for sale and certain derivative items. 

The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent these assets will more likely than not be realized. All available evidence is considered in making such determination, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portion of deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized, and any changes to the valuation allowance are recorded in income tax expense. 

The Company records the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that it will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recorded as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 

&#160; 

percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained. The benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax positions are generally recognized in the first period in which the more-likely-than-not threshold is met at the reporting date, the tax matter is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or when the related statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired. The recognition, derecognition and measurement of tax positions are based on management&#8217;s best judgment given the facts, circumstance and information available at the reporting date. 

The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other noninterest expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related liability lines in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2023 , the Company has recognized an immaterial amount in interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits. 

Derivatives 

The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Currently, five of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships, as the derivatives are not used to manage risks within the Company&#8217;s assets or liabilities. All changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s non-designated derivatives and fair value hedges are recognized directly in earnings. Changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s cash flow hedges are recognized in AOCI and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Per Share Data 

Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted year-to-date income per share includes the dilutive effect of 260,177 , 406,477 , and 466,830 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and nonvested restricted stock units granted by the Company that were outstanding at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

Certain options and restricted stock units issued under employee benefit plans were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2023 , there were 55,649 outstanding stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , there were no outstanding stock options or restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. For stock options, restricted stock, and service-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or an observed market price, if such a price exists. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is based on the quoted price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Such cost is generally recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award and, in some cases, when performance metrics are met. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based compensation on an actual basis as they occur. 

2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Troubled Debt Restructurings In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, &#8220;Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.&#8221; The ASU eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) by creditors and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments 

&#160; 

also added requirements to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases, disclosed by credit-quality indicator and class of financing receivable. The amendments in this update were adopted prospectively on January 1, 2023. The adoption of the amendments had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional and revised financial statement disclosures. See Note 3, "Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses" for related disclosures. 

Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, &#8220;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.&#8221; The ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update require additional disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional disclosures. 

3. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Loan Origination/Risk Management 

The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to minimize the level of risk within the loan portfolio. Diversification of the loan portfolio manages the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Authority levels are established for the extension of credit to ensure consistency throughout the Company. It is necessary that policies, processes, and practices implemented to control the risks of individual credit transactions and portfolio segments are sound and adhered to. The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the risk assessment on a continual basis. Management regularly evaluates the results of the loan reviews. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. 

Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Commercial loans are made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of the borrower, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts from its customers. 

Specialty lending loans include Asset-based loans, which are offered primarily in the form of revolving lines of credit to commercial borrowers that do not generally qualify for traditional bank financing. Asset-based loans are underwritten based primarily upon the value of the collateral pledged to secure the loan, rather than on the borrower&#8217;s general financial condition. The Company utilizes pre-loan due diligence techniques, monitoring disciplines, and loan management practices common within the asset-based lending industry to underwrite loans to these borrowers. 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. The Company requires that an appraisal of the collateral be made at origination and on an as-needed basis, in conformity with current market conditions and regulatory requirements. The underwriting standards address both owner and non-owner-occupied real estate. Also included in Commercial real estate are Construction loans that are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis or absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, economic conditions, completion of the construction project, and the availability of long-term financing. 

&#160; 

Consumer real estate loans, including residential real estate and home equity loans, are underwritten based on the borrower&#8217;s loan-to-value percentage, collection remedies, and overall credit history. 

Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower&#8217;s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer loans and leases. The underwriting and review practices combined with the relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Consumer loans and leases that are 90 days past due or more are considered non-performing. 

Credit cards include both commercial and consumer credit cards. Commercial credit cards are generally unsecured and are underwritten with criteria similar to commercial loans, including an analysis of the borrower&#8217;s cash flow, available business capital, and overall creditworthiness of the borrower. Consumer credit cards are underwritten based on the borrower&#8217;s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer credit cards and periodically reviews the distribution of credit scores relative to historical periods to monitor credit risk on its consumer credit card loans. 

Credit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure. Credit risk is mitigated with formal risk management practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process. Control factors or techniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor&#8217;s financial capacity, and monitoring the client&#8217;s activities. Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average risk ratings, and other aggregate characteristics.

##TABLE_END 

Accrued interest on loans totaled $ 119.6 mi llion and $ 90.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in the Accrued income line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount of accrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost basis of loans presented above. Further, the Company has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans, net charge-offs, non-performing loans, and general economic conditions. 

The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate loans. Changes in credit risk are monitored on a continuous basis and changes in risk ratings are made when identified. The loan ratings are summarized into the following categories: Non-watch list, Watch, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful. Any loan not classified in one of the categories described below is considered to be a Non-watch list loan. A description of the general characteristics of the loan rating categories is as follows: 

&#8226; Watch &#8211; This rating represents credit exposure that presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention by Company personnel due to conditions affecting the borrower, the borrower&#8217;s industry, or the economic environment. These conditions have resulted in some degree of uncertainty that results in higher-than-average credit risk. These loans are considered pass-rated credits. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Special Mention &#8211; This rating reflects a potential weakness that deserves management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the borrower&#8217;s credit position at some future date. The rating is not adversely classified and does not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 

&#8226; Substandard &#8211; This rating represents an asset inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified as substandard. 

&#8226; Doubtful &#8211; This rating represents an asset that has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage of strengthening the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, liquidation procedures, capital injection, or perfecting liens. 

Commercial and industrial 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial and industrial loans is included below: 

Equipment, accounts receivable, and inventory General commercial and industrial loans are secured by working capital assets and non-real estate assets. The general purpose of these loans is for financing capital expenditures and current operations for commercial and industrial entities. These assets are short-term in nature. In the case of accounts receivable and inventories, the repayment of debt is reliant upon converting assets into cash or through goods and services being sold and collected. Collateral-based risk is due to aged short-term assets, which can be indicative of underlying issues with the borrower and lead to the value of the collateral being overstated. 

Agriculture Agricultural loans are secured by non-real estate agricultural assets. These include shorter-term assets such as equipment, crops, and livestock. The risks associated with loans to finance crops or livestock include the borrower&#8217;s ability to successfully raise and market the commodity. Adverse weather conditions and other natural perils can dramatically affect farmers&#8217; or ranchers&#8217; production and ability to service debt. Volatile commodity prices present another significant risk for agriculture borrowers. Market price volatility and production cost volatility can affect both revenues and expenses. 

Overdrafts Commercial overdrafts are typically short-term and unsecured. Some commercial borrowers tie their overdraft obligation to their line of credit, so any draw on the line of credit will satisfy the overdraft. 

&#160; 

Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position. 

The following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Specialty lending 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Specialty loans is included below: 

Asset-based lending General asset-based loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate. The purpose of these loans is for financing current operations for commercial customers. The repayment of debt is reliant upon collection of the accounts receivable within 30 to 90 days or converting assets into cash or through goods and services being sold and collected. The Company tracks each individual borrower credit risk based on their loan to collateral position. Any borrower position where the underlying value of collateral is below the fair value of the loan is considered out-of-margin and inherently higher risk. 

&#160; 

The following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance by risk rating for asset-based loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Commercial real estate 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial real estate loans is included below: 

Owner-occupied Owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple economic cycles. The loans rely on the owner-occupied operations to service debt which cover a broad spectrum of industries. Real estate debt can carry a significant amount of leverage for a borrower to maintain. 

Non-owner-occupied Non-owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple economic cycles. The key element of risk in this type of lending is the cyclical nature of real estate markets. Although national conditions affect the overall real estate industry, the effect of national conditions on local markets is equally important. Factors such as unemployment rates, consumer demand, household formation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas. In addition to geographic considerations, markets can be defined by property type. While all sectors are influenced by economic conditions, some sectors are more sensitive to certain economic factors than others. 

Farmland Farmland loans are secured by real estate used for agricultural purposes such as crop and livestock production. Assets used as collateral are long-term assets that carry the ability to have longer amortizations and maturities. Longer terms carry the risk of added susceptibility to market conditions. The limited purpose of some Agriculture-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan repayment problems emerge. 

5+ Multi-family 5+ multi-family loans are secured by a multi-family residential property. The primary risks associated with this type of collateral are largely driven by economic conditions. The national and local market conditions can change with unemployment rates or competing supply of multi-family housing. Tenants may not be able to afford their housing or have better options and this can result in increased vacancy. Rents may need to be lowered to fill apartment units. Increased vacancy and lower rental rates not only drive the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay debt but also contribute to how the collateral is valued. 

1-4 Family construction 1-4 family construction loans are secured by 1-4 family residential real estate and are in the process of construction or improvements being made. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower&#8217;s ability to successfully complete a project on time and within budget. Market conditions also play an important role in understanding the risk profile. Risk from adverse changes in market conditions from the start of development to completion can result in deflated collateral values. 

General construction General construction loans are secured by commercial real estate in process of construction or improvements being made and their repayment is dependent on the collateral&#8217;s completion. Construction lending presents unique risks not encountered in term financing of existing real estate. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower&#8217;s ability to successfully complete a project on time and within budget. Commercial properties under construction are susceptible to market and economic conditions. Demand from prospective customers may erode after construction begins because of a general economic slowdown or an increase in the supply of competing properties. 

Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position.

Consumer real estate 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer real estate loans is included below: 

HELOC HELOC loans are revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential property. The primary risk is the borrower&#8217;s inability to repay debt. Revolving notes are often associated with HELOCs that can be secured by real estate without a 1st lien priority. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic downturns. 

First lien: 1-4 family First lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a first lien on 1-4 family residential property. These term loans carry longer maturities and amortizations. The longer tenure exposes the borrower to multiple economic cycles, coupled with longer amortizations that result in smaller principal reduction early in the life of the loan. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values. 

Junior lien: 1-4 family Junior lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a junior lien on 1-4 family residential property. The Company&#8217;s primary risk is the borrower&#8217;s inability to repay debt and not being in a first lien position. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic downturns. 

A borrower is considered non-performing if the Company has ceased the recognition of interest and the loan is placed on non-accrual. Charge-offs and borrower performance are tracked on a loan origination vintage basis. Certain vintages, based on their maturation cycle, could be at higher risk due to collateral-based risk factors. 

&#160; 

The following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Consumer 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer loans is included below: 

Revolving line Consumer Revolving lines of credit are secured by consumer assets other than real estate. The primary risk associated with this collateral is related to market volatility and the value of the underlying financial assets. 

Auto Direct consumer auto loans are secured by new and used consumer vehicles. The primary risk with this collateral class is the rate at which the collateral depreciates. 

Other This category includes Other consumer loans made to an individual. The primary risk for this category is for those loans where the loan is unsecured. This collateral type also includes other unsecured lending such as consumer overdrafts. 

A borrower is considered non-performing if the Company has ceased the recognition of interest and the loan is placed on non-accrual. Charge-offs and borrower performance are tracked on a loan origination vintage basis. Certain vintages, based on their maturation cycle, could be at higher risk due to collateral-based risk factors. 

&#160; 

The following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Credit cards 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact Credit card loans is included below: 

Consumer Consumer credit card loans are revolving loans made to individuals. The primary risk associated with this collateral class is credit card debt is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower&#8217;s willingness and capacity to repay. The highly competitive environment for credit card lending provides consumers with ample opportunity to hold several credit cards from different issuers and to pay only minimum monthly payments on outstanding balances. In such an environment, borrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a personal catastrophic event. 

The consumer credit card portfolio is segmented by borrower payment activity. Transactors are defined as accounts that pay off their balance by the end of each statement cycle. Revolvers are defined as an account that carries a balance from statement cycle to the next. These accounts incur monthly finance charges, and, sometimes, late fees. Revolvers are inherently higher risk and are tracked by credit score. 

Commercial Commercial credit card loans are revolving loans made to small and commercial businesses. The primary risk associated with this collateral class is credit card debt is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower&#8217;s willingness and capacity to repay. Borrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a catastrophic event. 

The commercial credit card portfolio is segmented by current and past due payment status. A borrower is past due after 30 days. In general, commercial credit card customers do not have incentive to hold a balance resulting in paying interest on credit card debt as commercial customers will typically have other debt obligations with lower interest rates in which they can utilize for capital.

Leases and other 

A discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Leases and other loans is included below: 

Leases Leases are either loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures or are loans related to all other direct financing and leveraged leases on property for leasing to lessees other than for household, family, and other personal expenditure purposes. All leases are secured by the lease between the lessor and the lessee. These assignments grant the creditor a security interest in the rent stream from any lease, an important source of cash to pay the note in case of the borrower&#8217;s default. 

Other Other loans are loans that are obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S., loans to non-depository financial institutions, loans for purchasing or carrying securities, or all other non-consumer loans. Risk associated with other loans is tied to the underlying collateral by each type of loan. Collateral is generally equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, 1-4 family residential construction and susceptible to the same risks mentioned with those collateral types previously. Other risks consist of collateral that is secured by the stock of a non-depository financial institution, which can be unlisted stock with a limited market for the stock, or volatility of asset values driven by market performance. 

Based on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed financial position.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from loans&#8217; and HTM securities&#8217; amortized cost bases to present the net amount expected to be collected on the instrument. Loans and HTM securities are charged off against the ACL when management believes the balance has become uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the allowance and do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 

&#160; 

Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and is tracked over an economic cycle to capture a &#8216;through the cycle&#8217; loss history. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in portfolio industry-based segmentation, risk rating and credit score changes, average prepayment rates, changes in environmental conditions, or other relevant factors. For economic forecasts, the Company uses the Moody&#8217;s baseline scenario. The Company has developed a dynamic reasonable and supportable forecast period that ranges from one to three years and changes based on economic conditions. Due to current economic conditions, the Company&#8217;s reasonable and supportable forecast period is one year. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical losses. The reversion method applied to each portfolio can either be cliff or straight-line over four quarters. 

The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exists. The ACL also incorporates qualitative factors which represent adjustments to historical credit loss experience for items such as concentrations of credit and results of internal loan review. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods. The Company&#8217;s portfolio segmentation consists of Commercial and industrial, Specialty lending, Commercial real estate, Consumer real estate, Consumer, Credit cards, Leases and other, and Held-to-maturity securities. Multiple modeling techniques are used to measure credit losses based on the portfolio. 

&#160; 

The ACL for Commercial and industrial and Leases and other segments are measured using a probability of default and loss given default method. Primary risk drivers within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans along with changes of macro-economic variables. The economic variables utilized are typically comprised of leading and lagging indicators. The ACL for Commercial and industrial loans is calculated by modeling probability of default (PD) over future periods multiplied by historical loss given default rates (LGD) multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs. 

&#160; 

Collateral positions for Specialty lending loans are continuously monitored by the Company and the borrower is required to continually adjust the amount of collateral securing the loan. Credit losses are measured for any position where the amortized cost basis is greater than the fair value of the collateral. The ACL for specialty lending loans is calculated by using a bottom-up approach comparing collateral values to outstanding balances. 

&#160; 

The ACL for the Commercial real estate segment is measured using a PD and LGD method. Primary risk characteristics within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans, along with changes of macro-economic variables, such as interest rates, CRE price index, median household income, construction activity, farm income, and vacancy rates. The ACL for Commercial real estate loans is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data. The PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The ACL for the Consumer real estate and Consumer segments are measured using an origination vintage loss rate method applied to the loans&#8217; amortized cost balance. The primary risk driver within the segments is year of origination along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and the home price index. 

&#160; 

The Credit card segment contains both consumer and commercial credit cards. The ACL for Consumer credit cards is measured using a PD and LGD method for Revolvers and average historical loss rates across a defined lookback period for Transactors. The PD and LGD method used for Revolvers is similar in nature to the method used in the Commercial and industrial and Commercial real estate segments. Primary risk drivers within the segment are credit ratings of the individual card holders along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and retail sales. The ACL for Commercial credit cards is measured using roll-rate loss rate method based on days past due. 

&#160; 

The ACL for the State and political HTM securities segment is measured using a loss rate method based on historical bond rating transitions. Primary risk drivers within the segment are bond ratings in the portfolio along with changes of macro-economic conditions. There is no ACL for the U.S. Agency and GSE mortgage-backed HTM securities portfolios as they are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. For further discussion on these securities, including the aging and amortized cost balance of HTM securities, see Note 4, &#8220;Securities.&#8221; 

&#160; 

See the credit quality indicators presented previously for a summary of current risk in the Company&#8217;s portfolio. Changes in economic forecasts will affect all portfolio segments, updated financial records from borrowers will affect portfolio segments by risk rating, updated credit scores will affect consumer credit cards, payment performance will affect consumer and commercial credit card portfolio segments, and updated bond credit ratings will affect held-to-maturity securities. The Company actively monitors all credit quality indicators for risk changes that will influence the current estimate. 

&#160; 

Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a concessionary loan term has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancelable by the Company. 

&#160; 

Credit card receivables do not have stated maturities. In determining the estimated life of a credit card receivable, management first estimates the future cash flows expected to be received and then applies those expected future cash flows to the credit card balance. Expected credit losses for credit cards are determined by estimating the amount and timing of principal payments expected to be received as payment for the balance outstanding as of the reporting period until the expected payments have been fully allocated. The ACL is recorded for the excess of the balance outstanding as of the reporting period over the expected principal payments. 

&#160; 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually include loans on nonaccrual, loans that include modifications deemed concessionary made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or any loans specifically identified, and are excluded from the collective evaluation. When it is determined that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for undiscounted selling costs as appropriate. All loans are classified as collateral dependent if placed on non-accrual or include modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

These modifications allow the borrower short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the ACL as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note. 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not modify any loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

The Company&#8217;s restructured loans are considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the allowance for credit loss as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note. 

The Company had no commitments to lend to borrowers with loan modifications classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2022.

##TABLE_END 

&#160; 

The unrealized losses in the Company&#8217;s investments were caused by changes in interest rates, and not from a decline in credit of the underlying issuers. The U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and GSE mortgage-backed securities are all considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest rates caused by changing economic conditions. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates. 

For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the majority of the Company&#8217;s holdings are in general obligation bonds, which have a very low historical default rate due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. For the State and political, Corporates, and Collateralized loan obligations portfolios, the Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis. The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends. 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $ 4.9 million impairment on one Corporate available-for-sale security. 

As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022 , there is no ACL related to the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale securities as the decline in fair value did not result from credit issues.

&#160; 

Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

There were no sales of securities held to maturity during 2023, 2022, or 2021. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, securities with an amortized cost of $ 4.1 billion and a fair value of $ 3.8 billion were transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. The transfers of securities were made at fair value at the time of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the time of transfer is retained in AOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the transferred securities. No gains or losses were recognized at the time of the transfers. The amortized cost balance of securities held to maturity in the tables above includes a net unamortized unrealized loss of $ 207.2 million and $ 247.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Accrued interest on securities held to maturity to taled $ 27.2 millio n and $ 27.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in the Accrued income line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount of accrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities presented above. Further, the Company has elected not to measure an ACL for accrued interest receivable. 

The following table shows the Company&#8217;s held-to-maturity investments&#8217; gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

##TABLE_END 

The unrealized losses in the Company&#8217;s held-to-maturity portfolio were caused by changes in the interest rate environment. The U.S. Agency and GSE mortgage-backed securities are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s expected lifetime loss for these portfolios is zero and there is no ACL recorded for these portfolios. The 

&#160; 

Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates. 

For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the Company&#8217;s holdings are in general obligation bonds as well as private placement bonds, which have very low historical default rates due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. The Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis. The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends. The underlying bonds are evaluated for credit losses in conjunction with management&#8217;s estimate of the ACL based on credit rating. 

The following table shows the amortized cost basis by credit rating of the Company&#8217;s held-to-maturity State and political subdivisions bond investments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Competitive held-to-maturity securities include not-for-profit enterprises that provide public functions such as housing, higher education, or healthcare, but do so in a competitive environment. It also includes project financings that can have relatively high enterprise risk, such as deals backed by revenues from sports or convention facilities or start-up transportation revenues. 

Utilities are public enterprises providing essential services with a monopoly or near-monopoly over the service area. This includes environmental utilities (water, sewer, solid waste), power utilities (electric distribution and generation, gas), and transportation utilities (airports, parking, toll roads, mass transit, ports).

The Company primarily has leases of real estate, including buildings, or portions of buildings, used for bank branches or general office operations. These leases have remaining lease terms that range from less than one year to 24 years and most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one month to 35 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion. No renewal options were included in the Company&#8217;s calculation of its lease liabilities or right of use assets since it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise these options. No leases include options to purchase the leased property. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. An insignificant number of leases include variable lease payments that are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For the calculation of the lease liability and right of use asset for these leases, the Company has included lease payments based on CPI as of the effective date of ASC 842. The Company has made the election not to separate lease and non-lease components for existing real estate leases when determining consideration within the lease contract.

In addition, lease liabilities of $ 58.9 million and $ 63.5 million were included as part of Other liabilities on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, lease expense of $ 11.1 million, $ 11.9 million, and $ 11.8 million, respectively, was recognized as part of Occupancy expense on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, cash payments of $ 12.2 million, $ 12.9 million, and $ 12.6 million, respectively, were made for leases included in the measurement of lease liabilities and are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Company&#8217;s

The Company had one short-term advance of $ 1.0 billion outstanding at FHLB Des Moines as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, in 2023, the FHLB Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $ 150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits.

The Company pays 0.4 % unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit. The Company currently has no outstanding balance on this line of credit. 

The Company enters into sales of securities with simultaneous agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements). The Company utilizes repurchase agreements to facilitate the needs of customers and to facilitate secured short-term funding needs. Repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Company monitors collateral levels on a continuous basis and may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Company&#8217;s safekeeping agents. The amounts received under these agreements represent short-term borrowings. The amount outstanding at December 31, 2023, was $ 2.1 billion, with accrued interest payable of $ 1.5 million. The amount outstanding at December 31, 2022 , was $ 2.2 billion, with accrued interest payable of $ 1.4 million.

10. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

Payment of dividends by the Bank to the parent company is subject to various regulatory restrictions. For national banks, the governing regulatory agency must approve the declaration of any dividends generally in excess of the sum of net income for that year and retained net income for the preceding two years. 

The Bank maintains a reserve balance with the FRB as required by law. During 2023 , this amount averaged $ 2.0 billion, compared to $ 2.3 billion in 2022. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company is required to have minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capit al ratios of 4.5 %, 6.0 % and 8.0 %, respectively. The Company&#8217;s actual ratios at that date were 10.94 %, 10.94 % and 12.85 %, respectively. The Company is required to have a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 %, and the leverage ratio at December 31, 2023 , was 8.49 %. 

As of December 31, 2023 , the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized the Bank must maintain total risk-based, tier 1 risk-based, common equity tier 1, and tier 1 leverage ratios of 10.0 %, 8.0 %, 6.5 %, and 5.0 %, respectively. There are no conditions or events that have occurred since the receipt of the most recent notification that management believes have changed the Bank&#8217;s categorization. 

In addition, under amendments to the BHCA introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as the Volcker Rule, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive limits on proprietary trading and on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds. The limits on proprietary trading are largely focused on purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal primarily for the purpose of short-term resale, benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or realizing short-term arbitrage profits. The limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in managed or advised funds and are not exposed to significant losses arising directly or indirectly from them. The Volcker Rule also provides for increased capital charges, quantitative limits, rigorous compliance programs, and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities, including a prohibition on transactions with a covered fund that would constitute a covered transaction under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The fund activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are in conformance with the Volcker Rule. 

&#160; 

Actual capital amounts as well as required and well-capitalized common equity tier 1, tier 1, total and tier 1 leverage ratios as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 for the Company and the Bank are as follows (in thousands):

&#160; 

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan 

At the April 26, 2005 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTIP) which became effective as of January 1, 2005. The LTIP permits the issuance to selected officers of the Company service-based restricted stock grants, performance-based restricted stock grants and non-qualified stock options. Service-based restricted stock grants contain a service requirement. The performance-based restricted grants contain performance and service requirements. The non-qualified stock option grants contain a service requirement. 

At the April 23, 2013 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved amendments to the LTIP Plan, including increasing the number of shares of the Company&#8217;s stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from 5.25 million shares to 7.44 million shares. Additionally, the shareholders approved increasing the maximum benefits any one eligible employee may receive under the plan during any one fiscal year from $ 1 million to $ 2 million taking into account the value of all stock options and restricted stock received. 

At the April 24, 2018 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan which became effective as of April 24, 2018 and replaced the LTIP plan. No service-based restricted stock grants, performance-based restricted stock grants or non-qualified stock options have been issued under the LTIP since 2018. 

The service-based restricted stock grants issued under the LTIP contained a service requirement with varying vesting schedules. The majority of these grants issued in 2016 through 2018 utilized a vesting schedule in which 50% of the shares vest after two years of service , 75% after three years of service and 100% after four years of service . Certain other grants utilized vesting schedules in which the grants vest ratably over the requisite service period or contain a three-year cliff vesting. 

The dividends on service-based restricted stock grants are treated as two separate transactions. First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock. Those cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock. Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock have the same terms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, similar to all dividend transactions. 

&#160; 

Total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was $ 2.5 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively. 

The non-qualified stock options carry a service requirement and grants issued prior to 2016 vested 50% after three years , 75% after four years and 100% after five years , while grants issued in 2016 through 2018 vested 50% after two years , 75% after three years and 100% after four years .

There were no options granted during 2023, 2022, or 2021. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , was $ 640 thousand, $ 1.2 million and $ 12.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 , there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options. 

&#160; 

Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation plans was $ 1.9 million, $ 1.5 million, and $ 18.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. The tax benefit realized for stock options exercised was $ 1.6 million, $ 2.2 million, and $ 2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

The Company has no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the Company has historically made adequate discretionary repurchases of common shares in an amount that exceeds stock option exercise activity. See a description of the Company&#8217;s Repurchase Authorizations in Note 14, &#8220;Common Stock and Earnings Per Share,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provided in Item 8 of this report. 

Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan 

At the April 24, 2018 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (OICP) which became effective as of April 24, 2018. The OICP permits the issuance to key employees of the Company various types of awards, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards. Service-based restricted stock unit awards contain a service requirement and the performance-based restricted stock unit awards contain performance and service requirements. The number of shares of the Company&#8217;s stock reserved for issuance under the OICP is 5.40 million shares. 

The service-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and the majority contain a service requirement with a four-year graded vesting schedule in which 50% of the units are vested after two years , 75% are vested after three years , and 100% are vested after four years . Grants of service-based restricted stock units made beginning in 2023 contain a service requirement with a three-year pro-rata vesting schedule. Certain other grants utilize vesting schedules in which the grants vest ratably over the requisite service period or have a cliff vesting. 

The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and contain a service and a performance requirement. The performance requirement is based on two predetermined performance requirements over a three-year period. The service requirement portion is a three-year cliff vesting. If the minimum performance requirement is not met, the participants do not receive the shares. 

The dividends on service-based restricted stock units are treated as two separate transactions. First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock units. Those cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock units. Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock units have the same terms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, similar to all dividend transactions. Dividends are not paid on performance-based restricted stock units.

The performance obligations related to this revenue include items such as performing full bond trustee service administration, investment advisory services, custody and record-keeping services, and fund administrative and accounting services. These fees are part of long-term contractual agreements and the performance obligations are satisfied upon completion of service and fees are generally a fixed flat monthly rate or based on a percentage of the account&#8217;s market value per the contract with the customer. These fees are primarily recorded within the Company&#8217;s Institutional and Personal Banking segments. 

&#160; 

Trading and investment banking &#8211; Trading and investment banking income consists of income earned related to the Company&#8217;s trading securities portfolio, including futures hedging, dividends, bond underwriting, and other securities incomes. The vast majority of this revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 320, Debt and Equity Securities , and is out of the scope of ASC 606. A portion of trading and investment banking represents fees earned for management fees, commissions, and underwriting of corporate bond issuances. The performance obligations 

&#160; 

related to these fees include reviewing the credit worthiness of the customer, ensuring appropriate regulatory approval and participating in due diligence. The fees are fixed per the bond prospectus and the performance obligations are satisfied upon registration approval of the bonds by the applicable regulatory agencies. Revenue is recognized at the point in time upon completion of service and when approval is granted by the regulators. 

&#160; 

Service charges on deposits &#8211; Service charges on deposit accounts represent monthly analysis fees recognized for the services related to customer deposit accounts, including account maintenance and depository transactions processing fees. Commercial Banking and Institutional Banking depository accounts charge fees in accordance with the customer&#8217;s pricing schedule while Personal Banking account holders are generally charged a flat service fee per month. Deposit service charges for the healthcare accounts included in the Institutional Banking segment are priced according to either standard pricing schedules with individual account holders or according to service agreements between the Company and employer groups or third-party administrators.

These fees are recognized within all Business Segments.

Brokerage fees &#8211; Brokerage fees represent income earned related to providing brokerage transaction services, including commissions on equity and commodity trades, and fees for investment management, advisory and administration.

Such income is recognized at a point in time as the trade occurs and the performance obligation is fulfilled. The performance obligations related to investment management, advisory and administration include allocating customer assets across a wide range of mutual funds and other investments, on-going account monitoring and re-balancing of the portfolio. These performance obligations are satisfied over time and the related revenue is calculated monthly based on the assets under management of each customer. All material performance obligations are satisfied as of the end of each accounting period. 

&#160; 

Bankcard fees &#8211; Bankcard fees primarily represent income earned from interchange revenue from MasterCard and Visa for the Company&#8217;s processing of debit, credit, HSA, and flexible spending account transactions. Additionally, the Company earns income and incentives related to various referrals of customers to card programs. The performance obligation for interchange revenue is the processing of each transaction through the Company&#8217;s access to the banking system. This performance obligation is completed for each individual transaction and income is recognized per transaction in accordance with interchange rates established by MasterCard and Visa. The performance obligations for various referral and incentive programs include either referring customers to certain card products or issuing exclusively branded cards for certain customer segments. The pricing of these incentive and referral programs are in accordance with the agreement with the individual card partner. These performance obligations are completed as the referrals are made or over a period of time when the Company is exclusively issuing branded cards. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company also has approximately $ 39.7 million, $ 34.5 million, and $ 34.0 million of expense, respectively, recorded within the Bankcard fees line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income related to rebates and rewards programs that are outside of the scope of ASC 606. All material performance obligations are satisfied as of the end of each accounting period.

These revenue streams are outside of the scope of ASC 606 and are recognized in accordance with the applicable U.S. GAAP. The remainder of Other income is primarily earned through transactions with personal banking customers, including wire transfer 

&#160; 

service charges, stop payment charges, and fees for items like money orders and cashier&#8217;s checks. The performance obligations of these types of fees are satisfied as transactions are completed and revenue is recognized upon transaction execution according to established fee schedules with the customers.

The Board authorized, at its April 26, 2022, and April 27, 2021 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting. On July 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company's common stock, which will terminate on April 30, 2024. All share purchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations are intended to be within the scope of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if the Company satisfies the manner, timing and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own common shares. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations. 

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential common shares that were outstanding during the year. 

The shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, are shown below:

15. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES 

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, standby letters of credit, and futures contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract or notional amount of those instruments reflects the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. Many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company. 

The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit is represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. These conditions generally include, but are not limited to, each customer being current as to repayment terms of existing loans and no deterioration in the customer&#8217;s financial condition. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The interest rate is generally a variable rate. If the commitment has a fixed interest rate, the rate is generally not set until such time as credit is extended. For credit card customers, the Company has the right to change or terminate terms or conditions of the credit card account at any time. Since a large portion of the commitments and unused credit card lines are never actually drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer&#8217;s creditworthiness on an individual basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation. Collateral pledged by customers varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, plant and equipment, stock, securities and certificates of deposit. 

Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce. Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule, drafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as intended. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company payable upon the non-performance of a customer&#8217;s obligation to a third party. The Company issues standby letters of credit for terms ranging from three months to six years . The Company generally requires the customer to pledge collateral to support the letter of credit. The maximum liability to the Company under standby letters of credit at December 31, 2023 and 2022 , was $ 407.6 million and $ 437.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , standby letters of credit totaling $ 29.7 million and $ 25.5 million, respectively, were with related parties to the Company. 

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary. Collateral varies but may include such items as those described for commitments to extend credit. 

Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date, of a specified instrument, at a specified yield. Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movement in securities values and interest rates. Instruments used in trading activities are carried at fair value and gains and losses on futures contracts are settled in cash daily. Any changes in the fair value are recognized in trading and investment banking income. 

The Company uses contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in the trading portfolio. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , there were no notional amounts outstanding for these contracts. There were no open futures contract positions during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022 . There was no net futures activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. The Company controls the credit risk of its futures contracts through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. 

The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts on a limited basis. For operating purposes, the Company maintains certain balances in foreign banks. Foreign exchange contracts are purchased on a monthly basis 

&#160; 

to avoid foreign exchange risk on these foreign balances. The Company will also enter into foreign exchange contracts to facilitate foreign exchange needs of customers. The Company will enter into a contract to buy or sell a foreign currency at a future date only as part of a contract to sell or buy the foreign currency at the same future date to a customer. During 2023 , contracts to purchase and to sell foreign currency averaged approximately $ 19.3 million compared to $ 13.8 million during 2022. The net gains on these foreign exchange contracts for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $ 4.2 million, $ 3.4 million and $ 2.6 million, respectively. 

With respect to group concentrations of credit risk, most of the Company&#8217;s business activity is with customers in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Illinois, and Texas. At December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any significant credit concentrations in any particular industry.

&#160; 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure 

The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate is based on expected utilization rates by portfolio segment. Utilization rates are influenced by historical trends and current conditions. The expected utilization rates are applied to the total commitment to determine the expected amount to be funded. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit loss rates to the expected amount to be funded. 

The following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified: 

Revolving Lines of Credit: includes commercial, construction, agricultural, personal, and home-equity. Risk inherent to revolving lines of credit often are related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. During these financial troubles, the borrower could have less than desirable assets collateralizing the revolving line of credit. The financial strain the borrower is experiencing could lead to drawing against the line without the ability to pay the line down. 

Non-Revolving Lines of Credit: include commercial and personal. Lines that do not carry a revolving feature are generally associated with a specific expenditure or project, such as to purchase equipment or the construction of real estate. The predominate risk associated with non-revolving lines is the diversion of funds for other expenditures. If the funds get diverted, the contributory value to collateral suffers. 

Letters of Credit: includes standby letters of credit. Generally, a standby letter of credit is established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the applicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and the applicant. These obligations might be the performance of a service or delivery of a product. If the obligations are not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit. 

The ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $ 5.1 million and $ 3.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and was recorded in the Accrued expenses and taxes line of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Provision of $ 2.0 million was recorded for off-balance sheet credit exposures for the year ended December 31, 2023 . A $ 500 thousand of provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 . A reduction of $ 3.0 million of provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures was 

&#160; 

recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 . Provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the Provision for credit losses line of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. 

16. INCOME TAXES 

Income taxes as set forth below produce effective income tax rates of 17.0 % in 2023 , 18.9 % in 2022 , and 17.7 % in 2021. These percentages are computed by dividing Income tax expense by Income before income taxes. 

Income tax expense includes the following components (in thousands):

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to interpret tax laws and regulations to determine its taxable income. Periodically, the Company is subject to examinations by various taxing authorities that may give rise to differing interpretations of these laws. Upon examination, agreement of tax liabilities between the Company and the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns may ultimately be different. The Company is in the examination process with two state tax authorities for tax years 2019 and 2020. The Company believes the aggregate amount of any additional liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. 

Deferred income taxes result from differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities for income tax return purposes.

As of December 31, 2023 , state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.2 million are included in the miscellaneous deferred tax assets line item above. These deferred tax assets include approximately $ 34.1 million related to net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce our income taxes payable in those future periods. Most of these net operating losses expire at various times between 2024 and 2043 and some have an indefinite carryforward. During the year ended December 31, 2023 , due to cumulative losses, the Company established a state valuation allowance of $ 2.1 million, against certain state deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company had a valuation allowance of $ 1.2 million and $ 13 thousand, respectively, for certain state net operating losses as they are not expected to be realized. In addition, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company had a valuation allowance of $ 2.1 million and $ 167 thousand, respectively, to reduce certain other state deferred tax assets to the amount management believes will be more likely than not realized. 

The net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in the Other assets line of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 2018 in the jurisdictions in which it files. 

Liabilities Associated With Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 10.9 million and $ 9.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, net of associated deferred tax benefit, that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $ 8.6 million and $ 7.4 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits relate to state tax positions that have a corresponding federal tax benefit. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not expect this change to have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. 

&#160; 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

17. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company&#8217;s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company&#8217;s loans and borrowings. The Company also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk of the Company&#8217;s assets or liabilities. The Company has entered into an offsetting position for each of these derivative instruments with a matching instrument from another financial institution in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. 

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 

The table below presents the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company&#8217;s derivative assets and derivative liabilities are located within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Derivative fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

This table provides a summary of the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands) :

&#160; 

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had three interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company&#8217;s municipal bond securities. These swaps had a notional amount of $ 254.6 million as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023 , the Company terminated all three fair value hedges. In connection with these terminated hedges, $ 11.5 million of hedging adjustments will be amortized through the contractual maturity date of each respective hedged item. 

For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company&#8217;s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and floors as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company had two interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company&#8217;s variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by Marquette Capital Trusts III and IV. These swaps had an aggregate notional amount of $ 51.5 million at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had three interest rate floors with an aggregate notional amount of $ 1.0 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The Company did not have any interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022. 

On August 28, 2020 , the Company terminated an interest rate floor with a notional amount of $ 750.0 million. At the date of termination, the interest rate floor had a net asset fair value of $ 34.1 million. The gross unrealized gain on the terminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI was $ 2.7 million, or $ 2.0 million net of tax, and $ 7.4 million, or $ 5.6 million net of tax, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The unrealized gain will be reclassified into Interest income as the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings through the original maturity of the hedged forecasted transactions. The total remaining term over which the unrealized gain will be reclassified into earnings is 0.7 years. 

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into interest expense and interest income in the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate swap derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company&#8217;s hedged items. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate floor derivatives will be reclassified to Interest income as interest payments are received or paid on the Company&#8217;s hedged items. The Company expects to reclassify $ 1.1 million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest expense and $ 2.5 million from AOCI to Interest income during the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 12.7 years. 

Non-designated Hedges 

The remainder of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly 

&#160; 

in earnings. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had 258 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 4.3 billion related to this program. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had 230 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 3.5 billion.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 

The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 

The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties. As of December 31, 2023, the Com pany had no t posted any collateral as there were no deriv atives in a net liability position. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2023 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value. 

18. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The following table presents information about the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value. 

Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In such cases, the fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring basis: 

Trading Securities Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities. 

Securities Available for Sale Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the year, if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. 

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values Fair values are based on quoted market prices. 

Company-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies. 

Bank-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies. 

&#160; 

Derivatives Fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

Securities sold not yet purchased Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. 

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis: 

Collateral Dependent Assets Collateral dependent assets are assets evaluated as part of the ACL on an individual basis. Those assets for which there is an associated allowance are considered financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments are recorded on certain assets to reflect write-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral. The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of comparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the property being valued. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the Company&#8217;s property management group and the Company&#8217;s credit department. The valuation of collateral dependent assets and impaired loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3. 

Other real estate owned Other real estate owned consists of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, recreational and marine vehicles. Other real estate owned is recorded as held for sale initially at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. The initial valuation of the foreclosed property 

&#160; 

is obtained through an appraisal process similar to the process described in the collateral dependent/impaired loans paragraph above. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are reviewed quarterly and updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements may be based upon appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods and those measurements are classified as Level 3. 

Fair value disclosures require disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. 

The estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):

Cash and short-term investments The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates of their fair values. 

Securities held to maturity For U.S. Agency and mortgage-backed securities, as well as general obligation bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. For private placement bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates. 

Other securities Amount consists of FRB and FHLB stock held by the Company, equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and equity securities without readily determinable fair values, including equity-method investments and other miscellaneous investments. The carrying amount of the FRB and FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying amount. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 

Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate, consumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount rates used are estimated using comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be commensurate with the credit risk, overhead costs, and optionality of such instruments. 

Demand and savings deposits The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts was the amount payable on demand at period-end. 

&#160; 

Time deposits The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates that are currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Other borrowings The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short-term nature of their maturities. Federal funds purchased are classified as Level 1 based on availability of quoted market prices and repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are classified as Level 2. 

Long-term debt Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt. 

Other off-balance sheet instruments The fair value of loan commitments and letters of credit are determined based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. Neither the fees earned during the year on these instruments nor their fair value at period-end are significant to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position.
