 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

UMB Financial Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UMB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Assessment of the allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment

As discussed in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded an allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 of $101.8 million. The Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses includes a general valuation allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment that is based on historical loan loss experience for loans with similar characteristics, adjusted for trends, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 

We identified the assessment of the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment (general valuation allowance) as a critical audit matter. The assessment required specialized skills and knowledge, and there was subjectivity in performing procedures in order to evaluate the (1) general valuation allowance methodology, (2) key assumptions, and the inputs to those key assumptions, utilized to determine the general valuation allowance, which included risk ratings of commercial loans, the evaluation of the time 

&#160;

span to charge-off, and determination of loss rates for adversely-rated loans&#59; and (3) adjustments in accordance with the qualitative framework. 

The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over (1) the development and approval of the general valuation allowance methodology, (2) the determination of key assumptions and the evaluation of inputs into the key assumptions&#59; and (3) the determination of qualitative risk factor adjustments. We tested certain sources of data used in the determination of the key assumptions, and evaluated the relevance and reliability of those sources of data. We involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

&#160;

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

UMB Financial Corporation is a bank holding company, which offers a wide range of banking and other financial services to its customers through its branches and offices in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana, Utah, Minnesota, California, and Wisconsin. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies to assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation.

Consolidation

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements (references hereinafter to the &#8220;Company&#8221; in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include wholly owned subsidiaries). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Interest on loans and securities is recognized based on rate times the principal amount outstanding. This includes the impact of amortization of premiums and discounts. Interest accrual is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful. Other noninterest income is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied.

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include Cash and due from banks and amounts due from the FRB. Cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks are included in Cash and due from banks. Amounts due from the FRB are interest-bearing for all periods presented and are included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

This table provides a summary of cash and cash equivalents as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands) :

Loans and Loans Held for Sale

Loans are classified by the portfolio segments of commercial, real estate, consumer, and leases. The portfolio segments are further disaggregated into the loan classes of commercial, asset-based, factoring, commercial credit card, real estate &#8211; construction, real estate &#8211; commercial, real estate &#8211; residential, real estate &#8211; HELOC, consumer &#8211; credit card, consumer &#8211; other, and leases.

A loan is considered to be impaired when management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is impaired, the Company records a valuation allowance equal to the carrying amount of the loan in excess of the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective rate, based on the loan&#8217;s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 

&#160;

A loan is accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring when a concession had been granted to a debtor experiencing financial difficulties. The Company&#8217;s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition. Restructured loans are individually evaluated for impairment as part of the allowance for loan loss analysis. 

Loans, including those that are considered to be impaired and restructured, are evaluated regularly by management. Loans are considered delinquent when payment has not been received within 30 days of its contractual due date. &#160; Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the collection of interest or principal is 90 days or more past due, unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal unless the remaining principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible. 

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management&#8217;s continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio, including actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing such loans. The actual losses, notwithstanding such considerations, however, could differ from the amounts estimated by management. 

The Company maintains a reserve, separate from the allowance for loan losses, to address the risk of loss associated with loan contingencies, which is included in the Accrued expenses and taxes line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In order to maintain the reserve for off-balance sheet items at an appropriate level, a provision to increase or reduce the reserve is included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. The level of the reserve will be adjusted as needed to maintain the reserve at a specified level in relation to contingent loan risk. The risk of loss arising from un-funded loan commitments has been assessed by dividing the contingencies into pools of similar loan commitments and by applying two factors to each pool. The gross amount of contingent exposure is first multiplied by a potential use factor to estimate the degree to which the unused commitments might reasonably be expected to be used in a time of high usage. The resultant figure is then multiplied by a factor to estimate the risk of loss assuming funding of these loans. The potential loss estimates for each segment of the portfolio are added to arrive at a total potential loss estimate that is used to set the reserve.

Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Loan fees (net of certain direct loan origination costs) on loans held for sale are deferred until the related loans are sold or repaid. Gains or losses on loan sales are recognized at the time of sale and determined using the specific identification method.

Securities

Debt securities available for sale principally include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, Government Sponsored Entity (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, certain securities of state and political subdivisions, and corporates. Debt securities classified as available for sale are measured at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales are computed by the specific identification method at the time of disposition and are shown separately as a component of noninterest income.

Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized historical cost based on management&#8217;s intention, and the Company&#8217;s ability to hold them to maturity. The Company classifies certain securities of state and political subdivisions as held to maturity. 

Trading securities, acquired for subsequent sale to customers, are carried at fair value. Market adjustments, fees and gains or losses on the sale of trading securities are considered to be a normal part of operations and are included in trading and investment banking income. 

Equity-method investments

The Company accounts for certain other investments using equity-method accounting. For non-marketable equity-method investments, the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. When transparency in pricing exists, other investments are considered marketable equity-method investments. 

&#160;

For marketable equity-method investments, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of income or loss as of the date of the Company&#8217;s C onsolidated Financial S tatements. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company performs a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit. If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required. Otherwise, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying amounts to determine if an impairment exists and the amount of impairment loss. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill over its fair value. 

No goodwill impairments were recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017. Other intangible assets are amortized over a period of up to 17 years and are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances dictate. No intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017. The Company does no t have any indefinite lived intangible assets.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is computed primarily on the straight line method. Premises are depreciated over 15 to 40 year lives, while equipment is depreciated over lives of 3 to 20 years . Gains and losses from the sale of Premises and equipment are included in Other noninterest income and Other noninterest expense, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including Premises and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets to their current carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value. No impairments were recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The provision for deferred income taxes represents the change in the deferred income tax accounts during the year excluding the tax effect of the change in net unrealized gain (loss) on securities available for sale.

The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent these assets will more likely than not be realized. All available evidence is considered in making such determination, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portion of deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized, and any changes to the valuation allowance are recorded in income tax expense.

The Company records the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that it will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recorded as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained. The benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax positions are generally recognized in the first period in which the more-likely-than-not threshold is met at the reporting date, the tax matter is ultimately settled 

&#160;

through negotiation or litigation , or when the related statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired. The recognition, derecognition and measurement of tax positions are based on management&#8217;s best judgment given the facts, circumstance s and information available at the reporting date. 

The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other noninterest expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related liability lines in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company has recognized an immaterial amount in interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits.

Derivatives

The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Currently, four of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships, as the derivatives are not used to manage risks within the Company&#8217;s assets or liabilities. All changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s non-designated derivatives and fair value hedges are recognized directly in earnings. Changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s cash flow hedges are recognized in AOCI and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Per Share Data

Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted year-to-date income per share includes the dilutive effect of 310,614 , 435,800 , and 615,629 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, nonvested restricted shares, and nonvested restricted stock units, granted by the Company that were outstanding at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Options issued under employee benefit plans to purchase 114,130 , 125,765 , and 149,413 shares of common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options were anti-dilutive.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. For stock options, restricted stock, and service-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or an observed market price, if such a price exists. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Such cost is generally recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award and, in some cases, when performance metrics are met. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based compensation on an actual basis as they occur. 

2. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#8221; The ASU replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it became effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods that begin after December 15, 2017. In March, April, and May 2016, the FASB issued implementation amendments to the May 2014 ASU (collectively, the amended guidance). The amended guidance affects any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The amended guidance specifically excludes interest income, as well as other revenues associated with financial assets and liabilities, including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives. The amended guidance permits the use of either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company adopted the amended guidance using the modified retrospective approach on 

&#160;

January 1, 2018. T he adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements , except for additional financial statement disclosures . See Note 13, &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221; for related disclosures. 

Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, &#8220;Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.&#8221; The amendment is intended to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in this update were adopted on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets of $ 132 thousand as an increase to the opening balance of total shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, &#8220;Leases&#8221; &#8211; ASC Topic 842. In January, July, and December 2018 and March 2019, the FASB issued implementation amendments to the February 2016 ASU (collectively, the amended guidance). The amended guidance changed the accounting treatment of leases, in that lessees recognize most leases on-balance sheet. This increased reported assets and liabilities, as lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset along with a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis. The amended guidance allows an entity to choose either the effective date, or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, as its date of initial application. The Company adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2019, using the effective date as the date of initial application. Adoption of the amended guidance resulted in the recording of a right-of-use asset of $ 58.2 million and a lease liability of $ 63.0 million to its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. The most significant effects of the adoption of the amended guidance are additional financial statement disclosures. See Note 8, &#8220;Premises, Equipment, and Leases&#8221; for related disclosures. 

Extinguishments of Liabilities In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, &#8220;Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.&#8221; The amendment is intended to reduce the diversity in practice related to the recognition of breakage. Breakage refers to the portion of a prepaid stored-value product, such as a gift card, that goes unused wholly or partially for an indefinite period of time. This amendment requires that breakage be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance within ASU No. 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#8221; The amendments in this update were adopted January 1, 2018 in conjunction with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, and the adoption had no impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Statement of Cash Flows In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 , &#8220;Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments.&#8221; This amendment adds to and clarifies existing guidance regarding the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows with the intent of reducing diversity in practice with respect to eight types of cash flows. &#160; The amendments in this update require full retrospective adoption. The amendments in this update were adopted on January 1, 2018 and did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, &#8220;Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.&#8221; The amendment eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendment also eliminates the requirement for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative test and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. The amendments in this update were adopted on October 1, 2017. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement had no impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Derivatives and Hedging In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, &#8220;Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.&#8221; The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The amendments in this update were adopted on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets of $ 13 thousand as an increase to the opening balance of total shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, &#8220;Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.&#8221; Under existing U.S. GAAP, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the law was enacted. When deferred tax balances related to items originally recorded in AOCI are adjusted, certain tax effects become stranded in AOCI. This amendment allows a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), and requires certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The amendments in this update were adopted using a security-by-security approach on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified stranded tax effects totaling $ 12.9 million from AOCI to retained earnings. &#160;

3. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 

Loan Origination/Risk Management

The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to minimize the level of risk within the loan portfolio. Diversification of the loan portfolio manages the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Authority levels are established for the extension of credit to ensure consistency throughout the Company. It is necessary that policies, processes and practices implemented to control the risks of individual credit transactions and portfolio segments are sound and adhered to. The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a continual basis. Management regularly evaluates the results of the loan reviews. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures.

Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Commercial loans are made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of the borrower, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts from its customers. Commercial credit cards are generally unsecured and are underwritten with criteria similar to commercial loans including an analysis of the borrower&#8217;s cash flow, available business capital, and overall credit-worthiness of the borrower. 

Asset-based loans are offered primarily in the form of revolving lines of credit to commercial borrowers that do not generally qualify for traditional bank financing. Asset-based loans are underwritten based primarily upon the value of the collateral pledged to secure the loan, rather than on the borrower&#8217;s general financial condition as traditionally reflected by cash flow, balance sheet strength, operating results, and credit bureau ratings. The Company utilizes pre-loan due diligence techniques, monitoring disciplines, and loan management practices common within the asset-based lending industry to underwrite and manage loans with these borrowers. 

Factoring loans provide working capital through the purchase and/or financing of accounts receivable to borrowers in the transportation industry and to commercial borrowers that do not generally qualify for traditional bank financing. 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. The Company requires an appraisal of the collateral be made at origination and on an as-needed basis, in conformity with current market conditions and regulatory requirements. The underwriting standards address both owner and non-owner occupied real estate.

Construction loans are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis or absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing. 

Underwriting standards for residential real estate and home equity loans are based on the borrower&#8217;s loan-to-value percentage, collection remedies, and overall credit history. 

Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower&#8217;s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer loans and leases and periodically reviews the distribution of FICO scores relative to historical periods to monitor credit risk on its credit card loans. The underwriting and review practices 

&#160;

combined with the relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Consumer loans and leases that are 90 days past due or more are considered non-performing. 

Credit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure. Credit risk is mitigated with formal risk management practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process. Control factors or techniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor&#8217;s financial capacity, and monitoring the client&#8217;s activities. Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average risk ratings, and other aggregate characteristics.

Loans are considered past due or delinquent when the contractual principal or interest due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement remains unpaid after the due date of the scheduled payment. Non-accrual loans include troubled debt restructurings on non-accrual status. Loan delinquency for all loans is shown in the tables above at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

The Company sold residential real estate loans with proceeds of $ 213.1 million, $ 59.1 million, and $ 70.5 million in the secondary market without recourse during the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The Company has ceased the recognition of interest on loans with a carrying value of $ 56.3 million and $ 43.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restructured loans totaled $ 19.8 million and $ 21.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest amounted to $ 2.1 million and $ 6.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was an immaterial amount of interest recognized on impaired loans during 2019, 2018, and 2017.

&#160;

Credit Quality Indicators

As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans, net charge-offs, non-performing loans, and general economic conditions.

The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate loans. The loan rankings are summarized into the following categories: Non-watch list, Watch, Special Mention, and Substandard. Any loan not classified in one of the categories described below is considered to be a Non-watch list loan. A description of the general characteristics of the loan ranking categories is as follows:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Watch &#8211; This rating represents credit exposure that presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention by Company personnel due to conditions affecting the borrower, the Borrower&#8217;s industry or the economic environment. These conditions have resulted in some degree of uncertainty that results in higher than average credit risk. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Special Mention &#8211; This rating reflects a potential weakness that deserves management&#8217;s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160;

the asset or the institution&#8217;s credit position at some future date. The rating is not adversely classified and does not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Substandard &#8211; This rating represents an asset inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. This category may include loans where the collection of full principal is doubtful or remote. 

##TABLE_END

All other classes of loans are generally evaluated and monitored based on payment activity. Non-performing loans include restructured loans on non-accrual and all other non-accrual loans.

This table provides an analysis of the credit risk profile of each loan class at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management&#8217;s judgment of inherent probable losses within the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss trends. The Company&#8217;s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors. 

The level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific loans&#59; however, the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management&#8217;s judgment, should be charged off. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control, including, among other things, the performance of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and changes in the regulatory environment. 

The Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 

The allowances established for probable losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of impaired loans. Loans are classified based on an internal risk grading process that evaluates the obligor&#8217;s ability to repay, the underlying collateral, if any, and the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates. When a loan is considered impaired, the loan is analyzed to determine the need, if any, to specifically allocate a portion of the allowance for loan losses to the loan. Specific valuation allowances are determined by analyzing the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk ranking of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower&#8217;s industry. 

General valuation allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience of specific types of loans including an evaluation of the time span and volume of the actual charge-off. The Company calculates historical loss ratios for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual charge-offs experienced to the total population of loans in the pool. The historical loss ratios are updated based on actual charge-off experience. A valuation allowance is established for each pool of similar loans based upon the product of the historical loss ratio, time span to charge-off, and the total dollar amount of the loans in the pool. The Company&#8217;s pools of similar loans include similarly risk-graded groups of commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial credit card, home equity loans, consumer real estate loans and consumer and other loans. The Company also considers a loan migration analysis for criticized loans. This analysis includes an assessment of the probability that a loan will move to a loss position based on its risk rating. The consumer credit card pool is evaluated based on delinquencies and credit scores. In addition, a portion of the allowance is determined by a review of qualitative factors by management, including concentrations of credit, current economic conditions, and loan growth. 

Generally, the unsecured portion of a commercial or commercial real estate loan is charged-off when, after analyzing the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, it is determined that the borrower is incapable of servicing the debt, little or no prospect for near term improvement exists, and no realistic and significant strengthening action is pending. For collateral dependent commercial or commercial real estate loans, an analysis is completed regarding the Company&#8217;s collateral position to determine if the amounts due from the borrower are in excess of the calculated current fair value of the collateral. Specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for any collateral deficiency. If a collateral deficiency is ultimately deemed to be uncollectible, the amount is charged-off. Revolving commercial loans (such as commercial credit cards) which are past due 90 cumulative days are classified as a loss and charged off .

&#160;

Generally, a consumer loan, or a portion thereof, is charged-off in accordance with regulatory guidelines which provide that such loans be charged-off when the Company becomes aware of the loss, such as from a triggering event that may include but is not limited to new information about a borrower&#8217;s intent and ability to repay the loan, bankruptcy, fraud, or death. However, the charge-off timeframe should not exceed the specified delinquency time frames, which state that closed-end retail loans (such as real estate mortgages, home equity loans and consumer installment loans) that become past due 120 cumulative days and open-end retail loans (such as home equity lines of credit and consumer credit cards) that become past due 180 cumulative days are classified as a loss and charged-off.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A loan modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) when a concession has been granted to a debtor experiencing financial difficulties. The Company&#8217;s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition. The Company&#8217;s restructured loans are individually evaluated for impairment and evaluated as part of the allowance for loan loss as described above in the Allowance for Loan Losses section of this note. 

&#160;

The Company had no commitments to lend to borrowers with loan modifications classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default. Determination of payment default involves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no TDRs for which there was a payment default within the 12 months following the restructure date. There was an immaterial amount of interest recognized on loans classified as TDRs during 2019 and 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had two commercial TDRs with aggregate pre- and post-modification loan balances of $ 11.5 million, and one commercial real estate TDR with a pre- and a post-modification loan balance of $ 3.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had three commercial TDRs with pre- and post-modification loan balance of $ 6.7 million, and one residential real estate TDR with a pre-modification loan balance of $ 93 thousand and a post-modification loan balance of $ 92 thousand.

Securities may be disposed of before contractual maturities due to sales by the Company or because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Proceeds from the sales of securities available for sale were $ 412.0 million, $ 95.5 million, and $ 578.5 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Securities transactions resulted in gross realized gains of $ 4.6 million for 2019, $ 581 thousand for 2018, and $ 4.2 million for 2017. The gross realized losses were $ 1.4 million for 2019, $ 3 thousand for 2018, and $ 10 thousand for 2017.

&#160;

Securities available for sale with a fair value of $ 5.8 billion and $ 5.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, were pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements. Of these amounts, securities with a fair value of $ 481.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2018 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of those dates.

The following table shows the Company&#8217;s available for sale investments&#8217; gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The unrealized losses in the Company&#8217;s investments in U.S. treasury obligations, Government Sponsored Entity (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, state and political subdivisions, and corporates were caused by changes in the interest rate environment. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost. The Company expects to recover its cost basis in the securities and does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2019.

Securities Held to Maturity

The following table shows the Company&#8217;s held to maturity investments&#8217; amortized cost, fair value, and gross unrealized gains and losses at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands):

##TABLE_END

The unrealized losses in the Company&#8217;s held to maturity portfolio were caused by changes in the interest rate environment. The underlying bonds are subject to a risk-ranking process similar to the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio and evaluated for impairment if deemed necessary. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost. The Company expects to recover its cost basis in the securities and does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019.

Investment in FRB stock is based on the capital structure of the investing bank, and investment in FHLB stock is mainly tied to the level of borrowings from the FHLB. These holdings are carried at cost. Other marketable and non-marketable securities include PCM alternative investments in hedge funds and private equity funds, which are accounted for as equity-method investments. Also included in other non-marketable securities are equity investments which are held by a subsidiary qualified as a Small Business Investment Company, as well as investments in low-income housing partnerships within the areas the Company serves. The Company&#8217;s investment in other marketable securities was fully distributed during 2019.

The fair value of other non-marketable securities includes alternative investment securities of $ 7.0 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 5.8 million at December 31, 2018. Unrealized gains or losses on alternative investments are recognized in the Other noninterest income line of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. 

5. SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL

Premises and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses were $ 50.8 million in 2019, $ 47.4 million in 2018, and $ 45.6 million in 2017. Rental and operating lease expenses were $ 14.8 million in both 2018 and 2017. 

The Company adopted ASC 842, Leases , using the effective date as the date of initial application of ASC 842 and will not recast comparative financial periods. 

The Company primarily has leases of real estate, including buildings, or portions of buildings, used for bank branches or general office operations. These leases have remaining lease terms that range from less than one year to 28 years and most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one month to 40 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion. No renewal options were included in the Company&#8217;s calculation of its lease liabilities or right of use assets since it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise these options. No leases include options to purchase the leased property. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. An insignificant number of leases include variable lease payments that are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For the calculation of the lease liability and right of use asset for these leases, the Company has included lease payments based on CPI as of the effective date of ASC 842. The Company has made the election not to separate lease and non-lease components for existing real estate leases when determining consideration within the lease contract. All of the Company&#8217;s lease agreements are classified as operating leases under ASC 842.

As of December 31, 2019, a right-of-use asset of $ 66.8 million and a lease liability of $ 73.0 million were included as part of Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, lease expense of $ 12.3 million was recognized as part of Occupancy expense on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash payments of $ 12.1 million were made for leases included in the measurement of lease liabilities, classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the year ended December 31, 2019, leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities were $ 19.2 million. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term of the Company&#8217;s leases was 8.6 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.06 percent.

The Company assumed long-term debt obligations from the acquisition of Marquette and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette 

&#160;

Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual balance of $ 103.1 million and had a carrying value of $ 70.4 million as of December 31, 201 9 . Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036 . 

The Company is a member bank of the FHLB of Des Moines. Through this relationship, the Company purchased $ 10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019. The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB Des Moines as of December 31, 2019. 

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $ 50.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.00 percent above LIBOR or 1.75 percent below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays 0.3 percent unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit. The Company currently has no outstanding balance on this line of credit.

The Company enters into sales of securities with simultaneous agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements). The Company utilizes repurchase agreements to facilitate the needs of customers and to facilitate secured short-term funding needs. Repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Company monitors collateral levels on a continuous basis and may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Company&#8217;s safekeeping agents. The amounts received under these agreements represent short-term borrowings. The amount outstanding at December 31, 2019, was $ 1.9 billion (with accrued interest payable of $ 220 thousand). The amount outstanding at December 31, 2018, was $ 1.5 billion (with accrued interest payable of $ 174 thousand). 

The carrying amounts and market values of the securities and the related repurchase liabilities and weighted average interest rates of the repurchase liabilities (grouped by maturity of the repurchase agreements) were as follows as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

10. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

Payment of dividends by the Bank to the parent company is subject to various regulatory restrictions. For national banks, the governing regulatory agency must approve the declaration of any dividends generally in excess of the sum of net income for that year and retained net income for the preceding two years. 

The Bank maintains a reserve balance with the FRB as required by law. During 2019, this amount averaged $ 560.9 million, compared to $ 396.0 million in 2018. 

At December 31, 2019, the Company is required to have minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capital ratios of 4.5 %, 6.0 % and 8.0 %, respectively. The Company&#8217;s actual ratios at that date were 12.33 %, 12.33 % and 13.26 %, respectively. The Company is required to have a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 %, and the leverage ratio at December 31, 2019, was 9.37 %.

As of December 31, 2019, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized the Bank must maintain total risk-based, tier 1 risk-based, common equity tier 1, and tier 1 leverage ratios of 10.0 %, 8.0 %, 6.5 %, and 5.0 %, respectively. There are no conditions or events that have occurred since the receipt of the most recent notification that management believes have changed the Bank&#8217;s categorization.

In addition, under amendments to the BHCA introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as the Volcker Rule, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive limits on proprietary trading and on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds. The limits on proprietary trading are largely focused on purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal primarily for the purpose of short-term resale, benefitting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or realizing short-term arbitrage profits. The limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in managed or advised funds and are not exposed to significant losses arising directly or indirectly from them. The Volcker Rule also provides for increased capital charges, quantitative limits, rigorous compliance programs, and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities, including a prohibition on transactions with a covered fund that would constitute a covered transaction under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The fund activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are in conformance with the Volcker Rule. 

&#160;

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

The Company has a discretionary noncontributory profit sharing plan, which features an employee stock ownership plan. This plan is for the benefit of substantially all eligible officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has accrued and anticipates making a discretionary payment of $ 2.0 million in March 2020, for 2019. A $ 1.5 million contribution was paid in 2019, for 2018. A $ 4.0 million contribution was paid in 2018, for 2017. 

The Company has a qualified 401(k) profit sharing plan that permits participants to make contributions by salary deduction, to which the Company makes matching contributions. In 2018, the Company changed the timing of matching contributions from annually to every pay period. As a result, the Company recognized expense related to matching contributions of $ 10.6 million, $ 8.8 million, and $ 6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company recognized $ 1.3 million, $ 1.5 million, and $ 2.5 million in expense related to outstanding stock options and $ 6.9 million, $ 8.2 million, and $ 10.4 million in expense related to outstanding restricted stock grants for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The Company also recognized $ 6.0 million and $ 807 thousand in expense related to outstanding restricted stock unit grants for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had $ 671 thousand of unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding stock options, $ 6.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock, and $ 9.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock unit grants at December 31, 2019. 

&#160;

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan 

At the April 26, 2005 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTIP) which became effective as of January 1, 2005. The LTIP permits the issuance to selected officers of the Company service-based restricted stock grants, performance-based restricted stock grants and non-qualified stock options. Service-based restricted stock grants contain a service requirement. The performance-based restricted grants contain performance and service requirements. The non-qualified stock option grants contain a service requirement.

At the April 23, 2013 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved amendments to the LTIP Plan, including increasing the number of shares of the Company&#8217;s stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from 5.25 million shares to 7.44 million shares. Additionally, the shareholders approved increasing the maximum benefits any one eligible employee may receive under the plan during any one fiscal year from $ 1 million to $ 2 million taking into account the value of all stock options and restricted stock received. 

The service-based restricted stock grants contain a service requirement with varying vesting schedules. The majority of these grants issued prior to 2016 utilize a vesting schedule in which 50 percent of the shares vest after three years of service , 75 percent after four years of service and 100 percent after five years of service . The majority of these grants issued in 2016 and beyond utilize a vesting schedule in which 50 percent of the shares vest after two years of service , 75 percent after three years of service and 100 percent after four years of service . Certain other grants utilize vesting schedules in which the grants vest ratably over the requisite service period or contain a three-year cliff vesting.

The performance-based restricted stock grants contain a service and a performance requirement. The performance requirement is based on a predetermined performance requirement over a three-year period. The service requirement portion is a three-year cliff vesting. If the minimum performance requirement is not met, the participants do not receive the shares. 

The dividends on service and performance-based restricted stock grants are treated as two separate transactions. First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock. Those cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock. Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock have the same terms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings (similar to all dividend transactions).

The expected option life is derived from historical exercise patterns and represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of the Company&#8217;s stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

There were no options granted during 2019 or 2018. The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2017 was $ 17.88 . The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, was $ 1.6 million, $ 6.1 million and $ 8.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, there was $ 671 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested options. The cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 0.9 years.

&#160;

Cash received from options exercised under all share based compensation plans was $ 3.8 million, $ 11.3 million, and $ 12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The tax benefit realized for stock options exercised was $ 766 thousand, $ 2.4 million, and $ 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 

The Company has no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options&#59; however, the Company has historically made adequate discretionary repurchases of common shares in an amount that exceeds stock option exercise activity. See a description of the Company&#8217;s Repurchase Authorizations in Note 14, &#8220;Common Stock and Earnings Per Share,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provided in Item 8, page 95 of this report.

Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan

At the April 24, 2018 shareholders&#8217; meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (OICP) which became effective as of April 24, 2018. The OICP permits the issuance to key employees of the Company various types of awards, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards. Service-based restricted stock unit awards contain a service requirement and the performance-based restricted stock unit awards contain performance and service requirements. The number of shares of the Company&#8217;s stock reserved for issuance under the OICP is 5.40 million shares.

The service-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and contain a service requirement with either a two-year cliff vesting or a three-year graded vesting schedule in which 50 percent of the units vest after two years of service and the remaining 50 percent vest after three years of service.

The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and contain a service and a performance requirement. The performance requirement is based on two predetermined performance requirements over a three-year period. The service requirement portion is a three-year cliff vesting. If the minimum performance requirement is not met, the participants do not receive the shares.

The dividends on service-based restricted stock grants and service-based restricted stock units are treated as two separate transactions. First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock or stock units. Those cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock or stock units. Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock or stock units have the same terms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings (similar to all dividend transactions). Dividends are not paid on performance-based restricted stock units.

As of December 31, 2019, there were no nonvested service-based restricted stock awards outstanding, and no awards were granted, cancelled, or vested during 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards. Total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2018, was $ 18 thousand.

12. BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following four reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, Personal Banking, and Healthcare Services (collectively, the Business Segments). Senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. Prior to 2018, the Company had the following three Business Segments: Bank, Institutional Investment Management, and Asset Servicing. During 2017, the Company sold all of the outstanding stock of Scout, its institutional investment management subsidiary. As the operations of Scout are included in discontinued operations, the Company no longer presents such operations as one of its business segments. The Company&#8217;s reportable Business Segments include certain corporate overhead, technology and service costs that are allocated based on methodologies that are applied consistently between periods. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at December 31, 2019. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this filing to conform to the current organizational structure. 

The following summaries provide information about the activities of each segment:

Commercial Banking serves the commercial lending and leasing, capital markets, and treasury management needs of the Company&#8217;s mid-market businesses and governmental entities by offering various products and services. Such services include commercial loans, commercial credit cards, letters of credit, loan syndication services, consultative services, and a variety of financial options for companies that need non-traditional banking services. Capital markets services include asset-based financing, asset securitization, equity and mezzanine financing, factoring, private and public placement of senior debt, as well as merger and acquisition consulting. Treasury management services include depository services, account reconciliation services, electronic fund transfer services, controlled disbursements, lockbox services, and remote deposit capture services. 

Institutional Banking is a combination of banking services, fund services, and asset management services provided to institutional clients. This segment also provides mutual fund cash management, international payments, corporate trust and escrow services, as well as correspondent banking and investment banking. Products and services include bond trading transactions, cash letter collections, investment portfolio accounting and safekeeping, reporting for asset/liability management, and Federal funds transactions. Institutional Banking also includes UMBFS, which provides fund administration and accounting, investor services and transfer agency, marketing and distribution, custody, and alternative investment services.

This segment combines the Company&#8217;s consumer bank with the individual investment and wealth management solutions. The range of services offered to UMB clients varies from a basic checking account to estate planning and trust services. Products and services include the Company&#8217;s bank branches, call center, internet banking and ATM 

&#160;

network, deposit accounts, retail credit cards, private banking, installment loans, home equity lines of credit, residential mortgages, small business loans, brokerage services, and insurance services in addition to a full spectrum of investment advisory, trust, and custody services.

The performance obligations related to this revenue include items such 

&#160;

as performing full bond trustee service administration, investment advisory services, custody and record-keeping services, and fund administrative and accounting services. These fees are part of long-term contractual agreements and the performance obligations are satisfied upon completion of service and fees are generally a fixed flat monthly rate or based on a percentage of the account&#8217;s market value per the contract with the customer. These fees are primarily recorded within the Company&#8217;s Institutional and Personal Banking segments. 

&#160;

Trading and investment banking &#8211; Trading and investment banking income consists of income earned related to the Company&#8217;s trading securities portfolio, including futures hedging, dividends, bond underwriting, and other securities incomes. The vast majority of this revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 320, Debt and Equity Securities , and is out of the scope of ASC 606. A portion of trading and investment banking represents fees earned for management fees, commissions, and underwriting of corporate bond issuances. The performance obligations related to these fees include reviewing the credit worthiness of the customer, ensuring appropriate regulatory approval and participating in due diligence. The fees are fixed per the bond prospectus and the performance obligations are satisfied upon registration approval of the bonds by the applicable regulatory agencies. Revenue is recognized at the point in time upon completion of service and when approval is granted by the regulators. 

&#160;

Service charges on deposits &#8211; Service charges on deposit accounts represent monthly analysis fees recognized for the services related to customer deposit accounts, including account maintenance and depository transactions processing fees. Commercial Banking and Institutional Banking depository accounts charge fees in accordance with the customer&#8217;s pricing schedule while Personal Banking account holders are generally charged a flat service fee per month.

Such income is recognized at a point in time as the trade occurs and the performance obligation is fulfilled. The performance obligations related to investment management, advisory and administration include allocating customer assets across a wide range of mutual funds and other investments, on-going account monitoring and re-balancing of the portfolio. These performance obligations are satisfied over time and the related revenue is calculated monthly based on the assets under management of each customer.

This performance obligation is completed for each individual transaction and income is recognized per transaction in accordance with interchange rates established by MasterCard and Visa. The performance obligations for various referral and incentive programs include either referring customers to certain card products or issuing exclusively branded cards for certain customer segments. The pricing of these incentive and referral programs are in accordance with the agreement with the individual card partner. These performance obligations are completed as the referrals are made or over a period of time when the Company is exclusively issuing branded cards. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company also has approximately $ 38.1 million, $ 36.0 million, and $ 27.8 million of expense, respectively, recorded within the Bankcard fees line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income related to rebates and rewards programs that are outside of the scope of ASC 606.

&#160;

The Board authorized the repurchase of up to 2 million shares of common stock annually at its 2017, 2018 and 2019 meetings. During 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with BAML to repurchase an aggregate of $ 50.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock through an ASR. Under the ASR, the Company repurchased a total of 780,321 shares. The final settlement of the transactions under the ASR occurred in December 2018. Other than purchases pursuant to the ASR, all share purchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations are intended to be within the scope of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if the Company satisfies the manner, timing and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own common shares. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential common shares that were outstanding during the year. 

The shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, are shown below:

15. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES 

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, standby letters of credit, and futures contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract or notional amount of those instruments reflects the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.

The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit is 

&#160;

represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. These conditions generally include, but are not limited to, each customer being current as to repayment terms of existing loans and no deterioration in the customer&#8217;s financial condition. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The interest rate is generally a variable rate. If the commitment has a fixed interest rate, the rate is generally not set until such time as credit is extended. For credit card customers, the Company has the right to change or terminate terms or conditions of the credit card account at any time. Since a large portion of the commitments and unused credit card lines are never actually drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer&#8217;s creditworthiness on an individual basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation. Collateral pledged by customers varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, plant and equipment, stock, securities and certificates of deposit.

Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce. Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule, drafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as intended.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company payable upon the non-performance of a customer&#8217;s obligation to a third party. The Company issues standby letters of credit for terms ranging from three months to six years . The Company generally requires the customer to pledge collateral to support the letter of credit. The maximum liability to the Company under standby letters of credit at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $ 299.9 million and $ 298.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, standby letters of credit totaling $ 3.7 million and $ 36.5 million, respectively, were with related parties to the Company.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary. Collateral varies but may include such items as those described for commitments to extend credit.

Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date, of a specified instrument, at a specified yield. Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movement in securities values and interest rates. Instruments used in trading activities are carried at fair value and gains and losses on futures contracts are settled in cash daily. Any changes in the fair value are recognized in trading and investment banking income.

The Company uses contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in the trading portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no notional amounts outstanding for these contracts. There were no open futures contract positions during the year ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. Net futures activity resulted in gains of $ 5 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no net futures activity for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net futures activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in losses of $ 6 thousand. The Company controls the credit risk of its futures contracts through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts on a limited basis. For operating purposes, the Company maintains certain balances in foreign banks. Foreign exchange contracts are purchased on a monthly basis to avoid foreign exchange risk on these foreign balances. The Company will also enter into foreign exchange contracts to facilitate foreign exchange needs of customers. The Company will enter into a contract to buy or sell a foreign currency at a future date only as part of a contract to sell or buy the foreign currency at the same future date to a customer. During 2019, contracts to purchase and to sell foreign currency averaged approximately $ 18.4 million compared to $ 23.9 million during 2018. The net gains on these foreign exchange contracts for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 1.8 million, $ 2.1 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively.

With respect to group concentrations of credit risk, most of the Company&#8217;s business activity is with customers in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Illinois, and Texas. At December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any significant credit concentrations in any particular industry.

17. INCOME TAXES 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act included numerous changes to existing tax law, including among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018. 

&#160;

Income taxes on continuing operations produce effective income tax rates of 14.8 percent in 201 9 , 12.2 percent in 201 8 , and 22.6 percent in 201 7 . These percentages are computed by dividing i ncome tax expense by Income from continuing operations before income taxes . 

Income tax expense from continuing operations includes the following components (in thousands):

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to interpret tax laws and regulations to determine its taxable income. Periodically, the Company is subject to examinations by various taxing authorities that may give 

&#160;

rise to differing interpretations of these laws. Upon examination, agreement of tax liabilities between the Company and the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns may ultimately be different. The Company is in the examination process with the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2014 and 2015 and with one state taxing authority for tax years 2015 and 2016 . The Company believes the aggregate amount of any additional liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. 

Deferred income taxes result from differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities for income tax return purposes.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table (in thousands):

Included in the miscellaneous deferred tax assets line item above are state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.1 million as of December 31, 2019. These net operating losses expire at various times between 2020 and 2039 . The Company has a full valuation allowance for a majority of these state net operating losses as they are not expected to be realized. In addition, the Company has a valuation allowance of $ 1.2 million to reduce certain other state deferred tax assets to the amount of tax benefit management believes it will more likely than not realize.

The net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2019 is included in the Accrued expenses and taxes line of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2018 is included in the Other assets line of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 2014 in the jurisdictions in which it files. 

Liabilities Associated With Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 5.8 million and $ 4.9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, net of associated deferred tax benefit, that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $ 4.6 million and $ 3.8 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits relate to state tax positions that have a 

&#160;

corresponding federal tax benefit. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not expect this change to have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

18. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company&#8217;s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company&#8217;s loans and borrowings. The Company also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk of the Company&#8217;s assets or liabilities. The Company has entered into an offsetting position for each of these derivative instruments with a matching instrument from another financial institution in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. 

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 

The table below presents the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company&#8217;s derivative assets and derivative liabilities are located within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivative fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

This table provides a summary of the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands) :

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets and liabilities due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, LIBOR. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had one interest rate swap that was designated as a fair value hedge of interest rate risk associated with the Company&#8217;s fixed rate loan assets. This swap had a notional amount of $ 5.3 million and $ 5.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. 

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company&#8217;s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and floors as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had two interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company&#8217;s variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by Marquette Capital Trusts III and IV. These swaps had an aggregate notional amount of $ 51.5 million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had one interest rate floor with a notional amount of $ 750.0 million that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk. The Company did no t have any interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2018.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into interest expense and interest income in the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate swap derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company&#8217;s derivatives. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate floor derivatives will be reclassified to Interest income as interest payments are received or paid on the Company&#8217;s derivatives. The Company expects to reclassify $ 518 thousand from AOCI to Interest expense and $ 2.7 million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest income during the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2019, the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 16.72 years.

Non-designated Hedges 

The remainder of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 142 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 1.9 billion related to this program. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 110 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 1.3 billion.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 

The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.

As of December 31, 2019, the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest, related to these agreements was $ 115 thousand. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had posted $ 400 thousand of collateral. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2019, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.

19. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The following table presents information about the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value. 

Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In such cases, the fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring basis:

Trading Securities Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities. 

Securities Available for Sale Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the year if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. 

Company-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies. 

Bank-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies. 

Derivatives Fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the 

&#160;

Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

Securities sold not yet purchased Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. 

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis:

Impaired loans While the overall loan portfolio is not carried at fair value, adjustments are recorded on certain loans to reflect write-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral. The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of comparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the property being valued. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the Company&#8217;s property management group and the Company&#8217;s credit department. The valuation of the impaired loans is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3. 

Other real estate owned Other real estate owned consists of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, recreational and marine vehicles. Other real estate owned is recorded as held for sale initially at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. The initial valuation of the foreclosed property is obtained through an appraisal process similar to the process described in the impaired loans paragraph above. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are reviewed quarterly and updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements may be based upon appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods and those measurements are classified as Level 3. 

&#160;

Fair value disclosures require disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. 

&#160; The estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (in thousands):

Cash and short-term investments The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates of their fair values. 

Securities held to maturity Fair value of held-to-maturity securities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates. 

Other securities Amount consists of FRB and FHLB stock held by the Company, PCM equity-method investments, and other miscellaneous investments. The carrying amount of the FRB and FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying amount. The fair value of PCM marketable equity-method investments are based on quoted market prices used to estimate the value of the underlying investment. The Company&#8217;s investment in other marketable securities was fully distributed during 2019. For the PCM non-marketable equity-method investments, the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag based on the valuation of the underlying investment(s). Other non-marketable securities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 

Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate, consumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount rates used are estimated using comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be commensurate with the credit risk, overhead costs, and optionality of such instruments. 

Demand and savings deposits The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts was the amount payable on demand at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

Time deposits The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates that are currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Other borrowings The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short-term nature of their maturities. 

&#160;

Long-term debt Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt. 

Other off-balance sheet instruments The fair value of loan commitments and letters of credit are determined based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. Neither the fees earned during the year on these instruments nor their fair value at period-end are significant to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position.
