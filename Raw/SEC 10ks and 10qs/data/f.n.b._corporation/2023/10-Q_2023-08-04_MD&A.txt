 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations at and for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained herein and our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023. Our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full year. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

This Report may contain statements regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset quality levels, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations. These statements can be considered &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve various assumptions, risks and uncertainties which can change over time. Actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and may not align with historical performance and events. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "plan," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "will," "should," "project," "goal," and other similar words and expressions. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws. 

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: 

&#8226; Our business, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business, economic and political circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) developments with respect to the U.S. and global financial markets; (ii) supervision, regulation, enforcement and other actions by several governmental agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), DOJ, CFPB, UST, OCC and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state attorney generals and other governmental agencies whose actions may affect, among other things, our consumer and mortgage lending and deposit practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, annual FDIC insurance premium assessment and growth, money supply, market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry; (iii) a slowing of the U.S. economy in general and regional and local economies within our market area; (iv) inflation concerns; (v) the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the U.S. or its global trading partners; and (vi) the sociopolitical environment in the U.S. 

&#8226; Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 

&#8226; Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, and on credit spreads, deposit gathering and product pricing, which can affect market share, loans, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate, react quickly and continue to respond to technological changes and significant adverse industry and economic events can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. 

&#8226; Business and operating results can also be affected by difficult to predict uncertainties, such as widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, including post-pandemic return to normalcy, global events and geopolitical instability, including the Ukraine-Russia conflict, shortages of labor, supply chain disruptions and shipping delays, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, significant political events, cyber-attacks, international hostilities or other extraordinary events which are beyond our control and may significantly impact the U.S. or global economy and financial markets generally, or us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors specifically. 

&#8226; Legal, regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and the ability to attract and retain talent. These developments could include: 

&#9702; Policies and priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration, including legislative and regulatory reforms, more aggressive approaches to supervisory or enforcement priorities with consumer and anti-discrimination lending laws by the federal banking regulatory agencies and the DOJ, changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, regulatory obligations or restrictions, consumer protection, taxes, 

employee benefits, compensation practices, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. 

&#9702; Ability to continue to attract, develop and retain key talent. 

&#9702; Changes to regulations or accounting standards governing bank capital requirements, loan loss reserves and liquidity standards. 

&#9702; Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, including interest rate policies and strategies of the FOMC. 

&#9702; Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements, enforcement actions or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, including financial and other type of commitments, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to FNB. 

&#9702; Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies. 

&#9702; Business and operating results are affected by our ability to effectively identify and manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of policies, processes, systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital and liquidity management techniques. 

&#9702; The impact on our financial condition, results of operations, financial disclosures and future business strategies related to the impact on the ACL due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions as a result of applying the &#8220;current expected credit loss&#8221; accounting standard, or CECL. 

&#9702; A failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or campaigns. 

&#9702; Increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding. 

We caution that the risks identified here are not exhaustive of the types of risks that may adversely impact us and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors and other uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Risk Management sections of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K , our subsequent 2023 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including the risk factors and risk management discussions) and our other 2023 filings with the SEC, which are available on our corporate website at https://www.fnb-online.com/about-us/investor-information/reports-and-filings or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. We have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only. Information on our website is not part of our SEC filings. 

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

A description of our critical accounting policies is included in the MD&#38;A section of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023 under the heading &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221;. There have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since December 31, 2022. 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 

To supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating earnings per diluted common share, return on average tangible common equity, operating return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, efficiency ratio and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. When non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed, the SEC's Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly 

comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included later in this report under the heading &#8220;Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators to GAAP&#8221;. 

Management believes items such as merger expenses, initial provision for non-PCD loans acquired and branch consolidation costs are not organic to run our operations and facilities. These items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities. The merger expenses and branch consolidation costs principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. 

To facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets (loans and investments) to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments (this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP). Taxable-equivalent amounts for the 2023 and 2022 periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. 

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 

Net income available to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2023 was $140.4 million or $0.39 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2022 of $107.1 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. On an operating basis, earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was $0.39 for the second quarter of 2023, excluding $0.2 million (pre-tax) in merger-related significant items, while the second quarter of 2022 was $0.31, excluding $2.0 million (pre-tax) in merger-related significant items. 

The second quarter&#8217;s earnings per diluted common share grew 30% compared to the prior year, and our liquidity metrics continue to be favorable. Our capital position remains strong with CET1 at 10%, while supporting loan growth and share repurchase activity in the quarter. Book value per share was $15.92, as compared to $15.19 at June 30, 2022. Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) continues to grow, totaling $8.79, up 8.6% year-over-year. Operating return on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) for the first six months of 2023 totaled 19.1%, and the efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) equaled 50%. 

Income Statement Highlights (Second quarter of 2023 compared to second quarter of 2022, except as noted) 

&#8226; Net interest income increased $75.6 million, or 29.8%, to $329.2 million primarily due to the benefit of growth in earning assets, the impact from the higher interest rate environment, deposit growth and prudent management of deposit betas. 

&#8226; On a linked-quarter basis net interest income of $329.2 million decreased $7.4 million, or 2.2%, from the prior quarter total of $336.7 million, primarily due to accelerating deposit costs and migration to time deposits, as well as higher total borrowings. 

&#8226; Net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) increased 61 basis points as a result of higher yields on loans, investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks reflecting the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by increased cost of funds. 

&#8226; On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 19 basis points to 3.37% largely due to increases in the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and total borrowings more than offsetting the increases in yields on earning assets. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses of $18.5 million supported loan growth and a specific reserve for a single commercial and industrial loan downgraded to nonperforming status during the quarter. Excluding this one credit, non-performing assets would have decreased 2 basis points. 

&#8226; On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income totaled $80.3 million, a $0.9 million, or 1.2% increase. 

&#8226; The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) was 50.0%, fueled by higher revenue, compared to 55.2%. 

&#8226; The effective tax rate was 20.5%, compared to 20.1%, driven by higher pre-tax income levels. 

Balance Sheet Highlights (period-end balances, June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, unless otherwise indicated) 

&#8226; Period-end total loans and leases, increased $3.3 billion, or 11.8%, as compared to June 30, 2022, which includes the Union acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Commercial loans and leases increased $1.7 billion, or 9.4%, and consumer loans increased $1.6 billion, or 16.2%. Our organic loan growth was driven by the continued success of our strategy to grow high-quality loans across our diverse geographic footprint. 

&#8226; On a linked-quarter basis, period-end total loans and leases increased $680.6 million, or 2.2%, as consumer loans increased $517.0 million with strong seasonal contributions from the Physicians First mortgage program and commercial loans and leases increased $163.5 million. Average loans and leases increased $638.0 million, or 2.1%, linked-quarter, with growth of $338.5 million in average consumer loans and $299.5 million in average commercial loans and leases. 

&#8226; On a linked-quarter basis, period-end deposits decreased $365.4 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to outflows from seasonal income tax payments and inflationary pressures on customers. We ended June 30, 2023 with approximately 77% of deposits insured by the FDIC or collateralized. We continue to offer reciprocal deposit products to our customers with less than $260 million in outstanding reciprocal deposit balances at quarter-end. 

&#8226; Total average deposits grew $69.6 million, or 0.2%, from the same prior-year period, led by increases in average time deposits of $2.0 billion, or 68.2%, offsetting the decline in average interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.1 billion, or 7.3%, average non-interest-bearing deposits of $754.5 million, or 6.4%, and average savings deposits of $114.2 million, or 2.9%, as customers continue to migrate deposits into higher-yielding products. 

&#8226; The ratio of loans to deposits was 92.7%, compared to 87.0%, as loan growth outpaced deposits. Additionally, the funding mix shifted modestly with non-interest-bearing deposits comprising 32% of total deposits at June 30, 2023, compared to 34%. 

&#8226; The ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases was stable at 1.32%, compared to 1.33%. The ACL on loans and leases totaled $413 million, compared to $402 million. 

&#8226; The annualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to total average loans ratio was 0.11%, compared to (0.01)% in the second quarter of 2022. While higher than the year-ago quarter, net charge-offs remain at historically low levels. 

&#8226; The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO increased 8 basis points to 0.47%. Total delinquency increased 4 basis points to 0.75%, compared to 0.71%. Both measures continue to remain at historically low levels. 

&#8226; Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) of $8.79, increased $0.52, or 3.2%, and $0.13 compared to June 30, 2022. AOCI reduced the tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.99 as of June 30, 2023, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on the fair value of AFS securities, compared to a $0.87 reduction as of March 31, 2023, a $0.99 reduction as of December 31, 2022 and a $0.72 reduction as of June 30, 2022. 

&#8226; The CET1 regulatory capital ratio was 10.1% benefiting from retained earnings growth in the quarter, partially offset by share repurchase activity. 

&#8226; During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased 2,288,558 shares of common stock at a weighted average share price of $10.80 while maintaining capital at targeted operating levels and supporting loan growth in the quarter.

Industry Developments 

BANKING INDUSTRY DISRUPTION 

During the second week of March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed and was taken over by federal regulators. The size of the bank, being over $200 billion in assets, made it the second largest U.S. bank to fail. Subsequently, that week, Signature Bank with assets over $100 billion, was also closed by federal regulators. On May 1, 2023, it was announced that First Republic Bank was another bank closed by federal regulators. While these failures were idiosyncratic in nature, these events called into question the stability of the entire banking sector and sparked customer fears of potential loss of deposit balances exceeding the FDIC's $250,000 insurance limit. 

While the high-profile bank failures had a diminishing effect on public confidence of the banking system, the federal government took mitigating action. To strengthen public confidence, the federal government announced that that all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank would be protected with any losses to the DIF recovered by a special assessment on banks. In addition to those actions, the FRB made available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. 

The additional funding was made available through the creation of a new BTFP, offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. The BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution's need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress. As of June 30, 2023, we have not participated in this program. Additionally, our total deposit balances have remained stable as a result of our granular deposit base with our average customer deposit account balance at approximately $29,000 (below the peer median) and our median consumer deposit account balance at approximately $5,000 as of June 30, 2023. FDIC-insured or collateralized deposits represented approximately 77% of our total deposits at June 30, 2023, which was higher than our peer median (based on peer data as of March 31, 2023) and we had ample liquidity to fund up to an estimated 140% of our uninsured and non-collateralized deposits. 

LIBOR and SOFR 

The United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who is the regulator of LIBOR, announced on March 5, 2021 that they will no longer require any panel bank to continue to submit LIBOR after December 31, 2021. As it pertains to U.S. Dollar LIBOR, the FCA announced that certain LIBOR tenors would continue to be published through June 30, 2023. Bank regulators, in a joint statement urged banks to stop using LIBOR altogether on new transactions by the end of 2021 to avoid the possible creation of safety and soundness risk. The FRB of New York created a working group called the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) to assist U.S. institutions in transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate. The ARRC recommended the use of SOFR as a replacement index for LIBOR. 

On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act (the LIBOR Act) was signed into law. As required by the LIBOR Act, the FRB's final rule, effective February 27, 2023, identifies FRB-based benchmark replacements for LIBOR contracts that will not mature prior to the LIBOR replacement date and do not contain clear and practical benchmark replacements. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based FRB-selected benchmark replacements for different categories of LIBOR contracts. In addition, the final rule identifies certain benchmark replacement conforming changes related to the implementation, administration and calculation of the FRB-selected benchmark replacement. The final rule expressly indicates that a determining person may select the FRB-selected benchmark which will become the benchmark replacement. Finally, the FRB's final rule preempts any state or local law or standard relating to the selection or use of a benchmark replacement or conforming changes. 

We have LIBOR exposure in various agreements, including variable rate loans, derivatives and debt we issued and acquired. We created an internal transition team that managed our transition away from LIBOR. This transition team consisted of a cross-functional team composed of representatives from the commercial, retail and mortgage banking lines of business, as well as representatives from loan operations, information technology, legal, finance and other support functions. The transition team determined that the primary index to be utilized for loans will be SOFR-based. 

Beginning in September 2020, adjustable rate mortgage loans have been originated with SOFR as the underlying index. We started originating commercial loans utilizing SOFR and other indices in the fourth quarter of 2021 and, effective January 1, 2022, ceased origination of LIBOR-based loans. For existing LIBOR-based loans, remediation efforts were completed by June 30, 2023. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 

Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $140.4 million or $0.39 per diluted common share, compared to $107.1 million or $0.30 per diluted common share for the three months ended June 30, 2022. On an operating basis, second quarter of 2023 earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was $0.39, excluding $0.2 million (pre-tax) of merger-related significant items. By comparison, the second quarter of 2022 was earnings of $0.31 per diluted common share (non-GAAP) on an operating basis, excluding $2.0 million (pre-tax) in merger-related significant items. The first quarter of 2023 was earnings of $0.40 per diluted common share (non-GAAP) on an operating basis, excluding $2.1 million (pre-tax) of merger-related significant items. The results for the second quarter of 2023 reflect revenue of $409.6 million, an increase of $73.7 million, or 21.9%. Additionally, the provision for credit losses was $18.5 million compared to $6.4 million primarily to support loan growth and a specific reserve for a single commercial and industrial loan that was downgraded to nonperforming status in the second quarter of 2023. Our non-performing loan coverage position remains strong at 289%. Non-interest income declined $1.8 million, or 2.2%, reflecting increased wealth management revenues, offset by reduced capital markets income, mortgage banking operations income, bank-owned life insurance and service charges income. Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2023 increased $19.2 million primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, outside services expense and FDIC insurance expense. The biggest driver of the non-interest expense increase was salaries and benefits with an increase of $10.1 million, or 9.7%, primarily from production-related commissions, the addition of the acquired Union expense base and normal annual merit increases.

(2) The interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

(3) Average loans and leases consist of average total loans, including non-accrual loans, less average unearned income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) increased $76.2 million, or 29.7%, to $332.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. Average earning assets of $39.5 billion increased $2.3 billion, or 6.1%, from 2022. In addition to the growth in average earning assets, net interest income benefited from the repricing impact of the higher interest rate environment on earning asset yields, which was partially offset by the higher cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts given customers' preferences migrating toward time deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities of $26.8 billion increased $2.7 billion, or 11.4%, from 2022, driven by an increase of $824.1 million in average interest-bearing deposits which included organic growth in new and existing customer relationships and an increase in average borrowings of $1.9 billion due to maintaining additional liquidity on the balance sheet following the banking industry disruption. Our net interest margin FTE (non-GAAP) increased 61 basis points to 3.37%, as the yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 189 basis points. The total cost of funds increased 134 basis points to 1.64% with a 169 basis-point increase in interest-bearing deposit costs, as well as an increase of 146 basis points in long-term debt cost partially due to the August 2022 issuance of $350 million of 5.150% fixed rate senior notes due in 2025. 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volumes and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022:

(1) The amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes. 

(2) Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $487.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, increased $204.0 million, or 72.0%, from the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to the impact of the 2022 and 2023 interest rate increases by the FOMC and an increase in average earning assets of $2.3 billion. The increase in earning assets was primarily driven by a $3.8 billion, or 14.0%, increase in average loans and leases and an increase in average securities, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 billion in average cash balances. Commercial loan growth of $2.0 billion, or 11.6%, was led by increases of $1.1 billion in commercial real estate and $854.9 million in commercial and industrial loans, primarily in the Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Charlotte markets. Average consumer loans increased $1.8 billion, or 18.3%, with a $1.4 billion increase in residential mortgages reflecting adjustable-rate mortgages which we retained on the balance sheet and the continued success of the Physicians First mortgage program, as well as a $231.9 million increase in indirect auto loans and a $88.7 million increase in direct installment loans driven by organic loan origination activity. The yield on average earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 189 basis points to 

4.94% for the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher yields on loans, investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks reflecting the higher interest rate environment. 

Interest expense of $155.0 million for the second quarter of 2023 increased $127.9 million, from the same quarter of 2022, due to an increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities and growth in average interest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $824.1 million, or 3.8% and average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $754.5 million, or 6.4%. The growth in average deposits reflected organic growth in new and existing customer relationships and inflows from the Union acquisition. Average short-term borrowings increased $918.9 million, or 64.6%, primarily reflecting increases of $954.5 million and $69.2 million in short-term FHLB advances and Federal Funds purchases, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $88.7 in repurchase agreements. Average long-term borrowings increased $991.4 million, or 139.2%, primarily reflecting increases of $911.0 million in long-term FHLB advances and $48.7 million in senior notes during the second quarter of 2023 as we have maintained additional liquidity following the banking industry disruption. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 187 basis points from 0.45% to 2.32% for the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to the market trends as a result of the interest rate actions taken by the FOMC, combined with the issuance of senior debt in August 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is determined based on management&#8217;s estimates of the appropriate level of ACL needed to absorb expected life-of-loan losses in the loan and lease portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The following table presents information regarding the provision for credit loss expense and net charge-offs: 

TABLE 6 

Three Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Provision for credit losses on loans and leases $ 18,026 &#160; $ 6,989 $ 11,037 157.9 %

Provision for credit losses was $18.5 million during the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $12.1 million, from the same period of 2022. The second quarter of 2023 is comprised of an $18.0 million provision for loans and leases outstanding and a $0.5 million provision for unfunded loan commitments. The net increase reflects loan growth and a specific reserve for a single commercial and industrial loan downgraded to nonperforming status in the second quarter of 2023. At quarter end, we reserved for approximately 40% of our exposure on the aforementioned loan. The second quarter of 2023 reflected net charge-offs of $8.7 million, or 0.11% annualized of total average loans, compared to net recoveries of $0.4 million, or 0.01% annualized, in the second quarter of 2022. While higher than the year-ago quarter, net charge-offs remain at historically low levels.

Non-Interest Income 

The breakdown of non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 7 

Three Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Service charges $ 34,056 &#160; $ 34,693 $ (637) (1.8) % Trust services 10,630 &#160; 9,713 917 9.4 Insurance commissions and fees 5,996 &#160; 6,352 (356) (5.6) Securities commissions and fees 7,021 &#160; 6,052 969 16.0 Capital markets income 5,884 &#160; 8,547 (2,663) (31.2) Mortgage banking operations 4,907 &#160; 6,120 (1,213) (19.8) Dividends on non-marketable equity securities 5,467 &#160; 2,770 2,697 97.4 Bank owned life insurance 2,995 &#160; 4,043 (1,048) (25.9) Net securities gains (losses) (6) 48 (54) (112.5) Other 3,359 &#160; 3,816 (457) (12.0) Total non-interest income $ 80,309 &#160; $ 82,154 $ (1,845) (2.2) % 

Total non-interest income decreased $1.8 million, or 2.2%, to $80.3 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $82.2 million for the second quarter of 2022. The variances in the individual non-interest income items are explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges of $34.1 million decreased $0.6 million, or 1.8%, with strong treasury management services and interchange fees, partially offsetting the impact of overdraft practice changes that we implemented in the first quarter of 2023. 

Wealth management revenues increased $1.9 million, or 12.0%, as securities commissions and fees and trust income increased 16.0% and 9.4%, respectively, through contributions across the geographic footprint and an increase in assets under management. 

Capital markets income decreased $2.7 million, or 31.2%, due to a decrease in swap fees consistent with lower commercial loan production in the current macroeconomic environment and international banking that was partially offset by solid contributions from syndications and debt capital markets income. 

Mortgage banking operations income decreased $1.2 million, or 19.8%, as secondary market revenue and mortgage held-for-sale pipelines declined from 2022 levels given the sharp increase in mortgage rates and the retention of adjustable-rate mortgage originations on the balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2023, we sold $228.7 million of residential mortgage loans, compared to $328.4 million for the same period of 2022, a decrease of 30.4%. 

Dividends on non-marketable equity securities increased $2.7 million, or 97.4%, reflecting higher FHLB dividends due to additional borrowings. 

Income from BOLI decreased $1.0 million, or 25.9%, primarily due to life insurance claims in the year-ago quarter. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The breakdown of non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 8 

Three Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Salaries and employee benefits $ 113,946 &#160; $ 103,870 $ 10,076 9.7 % Net occupancy 16,689 &#160; 15,768 921 5.8 Equipment 21,345 &#160; 18,687 2,658 14.2 Amortization of intangibles 5,044 &#160; 3,549 1,495 42.1 Outside services 20,539 &#160; 17,265 3,274 19.0 Marketing 3,943 &#160; 4,628 (685) (14.8) FDIC insurance 7,717 &#160; 5,295 2,422 45.7 Bank shares and franchise taxes 3,926 &#160; 3,905 21 0.5 Merger-related 163 &#160; 2,027 (1,864) (92.0) Other 18,643 &#160; 17,780 863 4.9 Total non-interest expense $ 211,955 &#160; $ 192,774 $ 19,181 9.9 % 

Total non-interest expense of $212.0 million for the second quarter of 2023 increased $19.2 million, or 9.9%, from the same period of 2022. Non-interest expense increased $21.0 million, or 11.0%, when excluding merger-related significant items of $0.2 million and $2.0 million in the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The variances in the individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits of $113.9 million increased $10.1 million, or 9.7%, primarily from production-related commissions, the addition of the acquired Union expense base, and normal annual merit increases. 

Net occupancy and equipment of $38.0 million increased $3.6 million, or 10.4%, largely from the acquired Union expense base, as well as continued technology-related investments. 

Amortization of intangibles of $5.0 million increased $1.5 million, or 42.1%, primarily due to core deposit intangibles added as a result of the Union acquisition. 

Outside services of $20.5 million increased $3.3 million, or 19.0%, with higher volume-related technology and third-party costs, as well as the Union expense base. 

FDIC insurance of $7.7 million increased $2.4 million, or 45.7%, reflecting the previously announced FDIC assessment rate increase which was effective in the first quarter of 2023 as well as loan growth and balance sheet mix changes. 

The following table presents non-interest expense excluding significant items for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:

Income Taxes 

The following table presents information regarding income tax expense and certain tax rates: 

TABLE 10

Both periods&#8217; tax rates are lower than the statutory tax rate due to tax benefits primarily resulting from tax-exempt income on investments and loans, tax credits and income from BOLI. Income tax expense and the effective tax rate increased due to higher pre-tax income compared to the year-ago quarter. 

Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 

Net income available to common stockholders for the first six months of 2023 was $284.9 million or $0.78 per diluted common share, compared to $158.1 million or $0.45 per diluted common share for the first six months of 2022. On an operating basis (non-GAAP), net income available to common stockholders for the first six months of 2023 was $286.6 million, or $0.79 per diluted common share, compared to $200.7 million or $0.57 per diluted common share for the first six months of 2022. Net interest income totaled $665.9 million, an increase of $178.1 million, or 36.5%, compared to $487.8 million, as total average earning assets increased $2.2 billion, or 5.9%, including a $4.0 billion increase in average loans and leases from organic origination activity and acquired Union loans, as well as a $193.5 million increase in average investment securities. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) increased 77 basis points to 3.46%, as the yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 187 basis points to 4.81%, primarily due to higher yields on variable-rate loans, investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks reflecting the higher interest rate environment. The total cost of funds increased 115 basis points to 1.41% with a 152 basis point increase in interest-bearing deposit costs to 1.73%. Between June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2023, the FOMC raised the target Federal Funds interest rate by 350 basis points. The provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2023 totaled $32.6 million, compared to $24.4 million including $19.1 million of initial provision for non-PCD loans associated with the Howard acquisition in the year-ago period. The increase in provision for credit losses was driven primarily by loan growth, charge-off activity, and a specific reserve for a single commercial and industrial loan downgraded to non-performing status during the second quarter of 2023. Excluding this one credit, non-performing assets would have decreased 2 basis points. Non-interest income totaled $159.7 million, essentially flat with the year-ago period reflecting increased contributions from wealth management, dividends on non-marketable equity securities and service charges, partially offset by reduced contributions from mortgage banking due to the sharp increase in interest rates in 2022, capital markets income and other non-interest income. Non-interest expense totaled $431.9 million, increasing $11.7 million, or 2.8%. On an operating basis (non-GAAP), non-interest expense totaled $429.7 million, an increase of $44.3 million, or 11.5%, compared to the first six months of 2022. Salaries and benefits increased $18.1 million, or 8.4%, due to annual merit increases, reduced salary deferrals given lower loan origination volumes and the addition of the acquired Union expense base.

(2) The interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

(3) Average loans and leases consist of average total loans, including non-accrual loans, less average unearned income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) totaled $672.4 million, increasing $179.4 million, or 36.4%, as the higher interest rate environment benefited earning asset yields given the asset sensitive positioning of the balance sheet and the higher yields on new loan originations, which was partially offset by the higher cost of interest-bearing deposits given customers' preferences migrating toward time deposits and the current competitive interest rate environment. Average earning assets grew $2.2 billion, or 5.9%, primarily driven by organic loan origination activity and acquired Union loans and an increase in average investment securities offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) increased 77 basis points to 3.46%, primarily reflecting higher yields on loans, investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks due to the impact of the higher interest rate environment. 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volumes and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022:

(2) Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $934.2 million for the first six months of 2023, increased $394.6 million, or 73.1%, from the same period of 2022, resulting from the interest rate increases by the FOMC and a $2.2 billion increase in earning assets. The increase in earning assets was primarily driven by a $4.0 billion, or 14.9%, increase in average loans and an increase in average investment securities of $193.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 64.8%, in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. Growth in total average commercial loans included $1.0 billion, or 15.3%, in commercial and industrial loans and $1.0 billion, or 9.8%, in commercial real estate driven by a combination of organic loan origination activity led by the Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Charlotte markets, as well as adding the Union loans to portfolio balances. Average consumer loans increased $1.9 billion, or 20.5%, with an increase in residential mortgage loans of $1.4 billion, or 33.9%, reflecting adjustable-rate mortgages held in portfolio on the balance sheet and the continued success of the Physicians First mortgage program, which is a program that provides a bundled suite of specialized products to meet the personal and professional needs of physicians, dentists, veterinarians and other healthcare professionals. Additionally, indirect installment loans increased $278.5 million, or 22.2%, and direct home equity installment loans increased $185.5 million, or 7.2%, driven by strong organic loan origination activity throughout 2022. Additionally, the net increase in securities interest income was a result of replacing maturing securities with higher yielding securities, as the average securities yield increased 54 basis points. For the first six months of 2023, the yield on average earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 187 basis points to 4.81%, compared to the 

first six months of 2022, primarily due to higher yields on variable-rate loans, investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks reflecting the higher interest rate environment. 

Interest expense of $261.8 million for the first six months of 2023 increased $215.2 million, or 461.9%, from the same period of 2022, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in average interest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $943.1 million, or 4.3%, which reflects the benefit of solid organic growth in customer relationships and the addition of the Union acquisition. Average time deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 55.3%, as customer preferences shifted given interest rate increases. Average long-term borrowings increased $683.5 million, or 96.1%, primarily due to an increase of $138.1 million in senior debt resulting from the issuance of $350 million in 5.150% fixed-rate senior notes during August 2022, partially offset by the maturity of $300 million in 2.20% fixed-rate senior notes in February 2023. Additionally, long-term FHLB borrowings increased $508.3 million as we have maintained additional liquidity following the banking industry disruption. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 163 basis points to 2.02% for the first six months of 2023, compared to the first six months of 2022, as the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 152 basis points from 0.21% to 1.73%. These increases were primarily due to the market trends as a result of the interest rate actions taken by the FOMC, combined with the issuance of senior debt in August 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The following table presents information regarding the provision for credit loss expense and net charge-offs: 

TABLE 15 

Six Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Provision for credit losses on loans and leases $ 32,917 &#160; $ 25,225 $ 7,692 30.5 % Provision for unfunded loan commitments (434) (919) 485 52.8 Total provision for credit losses on loans and leases 32,483 &#160; 24,306 8,177 33.6 Provision for securities 95 &#160; 75 20 26.7 Total provision for credit losses $ 32,578 &#160; $ 24,381 $ 8,197 33.6 % Net loan charge-offs $ 21,897 &#160; $ 1,507 $ 20,390 1,353.0 % Net loan charge-offs (annualized) / total average loans and leases 0.14 &#160; % 0.01 % 

The provision for credit losses was $32.6 million, compared to $24.4 million in the first six months of 2022. The provision for credit losses in the first six months of 2022 included $19.1 million of initial provision for non-PCD loans associated with the Howard acquisition. The provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2023 was primarily due to loan growth, charge-off activity and a $13 million specific reserve established for a single $32 million commercial and industrial loan downgraded to non-performing status during the second quarter of 2023. Our non-performing loan coverage position remains strong at 289%. Excluding this one credit, non-performing assets would have decreased 2 basis points. The six months of 2023 reflected net charge-offs of $21.9 million, or 0.14% annualized of total average loans, compared to $1.5 million, or 0.01% annualized, in the first six months of 2022. While elevated from the year-ago quarter, net charge-offs remain at historically low levels. The ACL was $412.7 million, an increase of $34.7 million, with the ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases decreasing 3 basis points to 1.32%, reflecting the strong loan growth and the $11.2 million acquisition-related ACL increase from the December 2022 Union acquisition. 

Non-Interest Income 

The breakdown of non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 16 

Six Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Service charges $ 66,696 &#160; $ 66,208 $ 488 0.7 % Trust services 21,241 &#160; 20,062 1,179 5.9 Insurance commissions and fees 13,783 &#160; 13,957 (174) (1.2) Securities commissions and fees 14,403 &#160; 11,743 2,660 22.7 Capital markets income 12,677 &#160; 15,674 (2,997) (19.1) Mortgage banking operations 9,762 &#160; 12,787 (3,025) (23.7) Dividends on non-marketable equity securities 9,575 &#160; 4,920 4,655 94.6 Bank owned life insurance 5,820 &#160; 6,685 (865) (12.9) Net securities gains (losses) (23) 48 (71) (147.9) Other 5,764 &#160; 8,392 (2,628) (31.3) Total non-interest income $ 159,698 &#160; $ 160,476 $ (778) (0.5) % 

Total non-interest income decreased $0.8 million, or 0.5%. The variances in significant individual non-interest income items are explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges increased $0.5 million, or 0.7%, with strong treasury management services, interchange fees and higher customer activity offsetting the impact of overdraft practice changes that FNB implemented in the first quarter of 2023. 

Wealth management revenues increased $3.8 million, or 12.1%, as securities commissions and fees and trust income increased 22.7% and 5.9%, respectively, through contributions across the geographic footprint and an increase in assets under management. 

Capital markets income decreased $3.0 million, or 19.1%, as swap activity declined consistent with lower commercial loan production in the current macroeconomic environment, and was partially offset by an increase in syndications revenue, debt capital markets and international banking. 

Mortgage banking operations income of $9.8 million decreased $3.0 million, or 23.7%, as secondary market revenue and mortgage held-for-sale pipelines declined from 2022 due to the sharp increase in interest rates throughout 2022 and the gain on sale margins moderating to historical levels. During the first six months of 2023, we sold $438.3 million of residential mortgage loans, a 37.0% decrease compared to $695.4 million for the same period of 2022. 

Dividends on non-marketable equity securities of $9.6 million increased $4.7 million, or 94.6%, reflecting higher FHLB dividends due to additional borrowings. 

Other non-interest income was $5.8 million and $8.4 million for the first six months of 2023 and 2022, respectively, as SBA premium income declined from elevated levels due to the higher interest rate environment, reduced market premiums and correspondingly lower sold loan volumes. Additionally, Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) funds income decreased, which fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying portfolio companies. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The breakdown of non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 17 

Six Months Ended June 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Salaries and employee benefits $ 234,193 &#160; $ 216,059 $ 18,134 8.4 % Net occupancy 34,059 &#160; 33,957 102 0.3 Equipment 43,417 &#160; 36,692 6,725 18.3 Amortization of intangibles 10,163 &#160; 6,776 3,387 50.0 Outside services 39,937 &#160; 34,298 5,639 16.4 Marketing 7,644 &#160; 7,884 (240) (3.0) FDIC insurance 14,836 &#160; 9,869 4,967 50.3 Bank shares and franchise taxes 8,098 &#160; 7,932 166 2.1 Merger-related 2,215 &#160; 30,656 (28,441) (92.8) Other 37,310 &#160; 36,077 1,233 3.4 Total non-interest expense $ 431,872 &#160; $ 420,200 $ 11,672 2.8 % 

Total non-interest expense of $431.9 million for the first six months of 2023 increased $11.7 million, a 2.8% increase from the same period of 2022. On an operating basis, non-interest expense (non-GAAP) increased $44.3 million, or 11.5%, when excluding significant items of $2.2 million in merger-related costs in the first six months of 2023 and $30.7 million in merger-related costs and $4.2 million in branch consolidation costs in the first six months of 2022. The variances in the individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits increased $18.1 million, or 8.4%, related to annual merit increases, reduced salary deferrals given lower loan origination volumes and the addition of the acquired Union expense base. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense of $77.5 million increased $6.8 million, or 9.7%, primarily from continued technology-related investments and the acquired Union expense base. 

Amortization of intangibles increased $3.4 million, or 50.0%, primarily related to the Union core deposit intangible. 

Outside services increased $5.6 million, or 16.4%, with higher volume-related technology and third-party costs, as well as the addition of the Union expense base. 

FDIC insurance increased $5.0 million, or 50.3%, primarily due to the previously announced FDIC assessment rate increase which was effective in the first quarter of 2023 as well as loan growth and balance sheet mix changes. 

We recorded $2.2 million in merger-related costs in the first six months of 2023 related to the Union acquisition completed in December 2022, compared to $30.7 million in the first six months of 2022 related to the Union acquisition and Howard acquisition completed in January 2022.

Income tax expense was higher in 2023 due to higher pre-tax earnings, as we had merger-related expense from the Union and Howard acquisitions in 2022. However, the effective tax rate was slightly lower in 2023 primarily as a result of higher deduction levels from employee stock compensation vesting.

Lending Activity 

The loan and lease portfolio consists principally of loans and leases to individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses within our primary markets in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Washington, D.C.; Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. 

Following is a summary of loans and leases: 

TABLE 21 

June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ Change % Change (in millions) Commercial real estate $ 11,689 &#160; $ 11,526 $ 163 1.4 % Commercial and industrial 7,248 &#160; 7,131 117 1.6 Commercial leases 618 &#160; 519 99 19.1 Other 121 &#160; 114 7 6.1 Total commercial loans and leases 19,676 &#160; 19,290 386 2.0 Direct installment 2,747 &#160; 2,784 (37) (1.3) Residential mortgages 6,089 &#160; 5,297 792 15.0 Indirect installment 1,539 &#160; 1,553 (14) (0.9) Consumer lines of credit 1,303 &#160; 1,331 (28) (2.1) Total consumer loans 11,678 &#160; 10,965 713 6.5 Total loans and leases $ 31,354 &#160; $ 30,255 $ 1,099 3.6 % 

The commercial and industrial growth was led by activity in the Pittsburgh, Cleveland and North Carolina markets while the growth in residential mortgages reflected growth in adjustable-rate mortgages retained on the balance sheet and the continued success of our Physicians First mortgage program. Our commercial real estate portfolio included $8.2 billion of non-owner occupied loans of which 22% represented office space. Our top 25 non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans averaged approximately $30 million per exposure although the office space was primarily made up of mid-sized offices located outside of metropolitan business districts with 41% of the office portfolio averaging less than $5 million per exposure. 

Non-Performing Assets 

Following is a summary of non-performing assets: 

TABLE 22

Non-performing assets increased $28.3 million, from $119.5 million at December 31, 2022 to $147.8 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a single commercial and industrial loan downgraded to non-performing status during the quarter. This reflects an increase of $29.2 million in non-performing loans and leases and a decrease of $0.9 million in OREO. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The model used to calculate the ACL is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality, as well as historical experience, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates. Specifically, the following considerations are incorporated into the ACL calculation: 

&#8226; a third-party macroeconomic forecast scenario; 

&#8226; a 24-month R&#38;S forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period; and 

&#8226; the historical through-the-cycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period. 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we utilized a third-party consensus macroeconomic forecast reflecting the current and projected macroeconomic environment. For our ACL calculation at June 30, 2023, the macroeconomic variables that we utilized included, but were not limited to: (i) the purchase only Housing Price Index, which declines 5.4% over our R&#38;S forecast period, (ii) a Commercial Real Estate Price Index, which declines 8.9% over our R&#38;S forecast period, (iii) S&#38;P Volatility, which decreases 33.2% in 2023 and 21.0% in 2024 and (iv) bankruptcies, which increase steadily over the R&#38;S forecast period but average below historical through the cycle period. Macroeconomic variables that we utilized for our ACL calculation as of December 31, 2022 included, but were not limited to: (i) the purchase only Housing Price Index, which declines 3.7% over our R&#38;S forecast period, (ii) a Commercial Real Estate Price Index, which declines 0.9% over our R&#38;S forecast period, (iii) S&#38;P Volatility, which decreases 41.0% in 2023 and 8.1% in 2024 and (iv) bankruptcies, which increase steadily over the R&#38;S forecast period but average below historical levels. 

Following is a summary of certain data related to the ACL and loans and leases:

The ACL on loans and leases of $412.7 million at June 30, 2023 increased $11.0 million, or 2.7%, from December 31, 2022. Our ending ACL coverage ratio at June 30, 2023 was stable at 1.32%, compared to 1.33% at December 31, 2022. Total provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $32.6 million, compared to $24.4 million for the same period in 2022 with the year-ago quarter reflecting $19.1 million of initial provision for non-PCD loans associated with the Howard acquisition. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by loan growth, charge-off activity and a specific reserve for a single commercial and industrial loan downgraded to non-performing status during the second quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs were $21.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $1.5 million for the first six months of 2022. While elevated from the year-ago quarter, net charge-offs remain at historically low levels. The ACL as a percentage of non-performing loans for the total portfolio was 289% as of June 30, 2023 compared to 354% as of December 31, 2022. 

Deposits 

Our primary source of funds is deposits. Our diversified and granular deposit base are provided by business, consumer and municipal customers who we serve within our footprint. 

Following is a summary of deposits: 

TABLE 24 

(in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ Change % Change Non-interest-bearing demand $ 10,914 &#160; $ 11,916 $ (1,002) (8.4) % Interest-bearing demand 13,818 &#160; 15,100 (1,282) (8.5) Savings 3,758 &#160; 4,142 (384) (9.3) Certificates and other time deposits 5,335 &#160; 3,612 1,723 47.7 Total deposits $ 33,825 &#160; $ 34,770 $ (945) (2.7) % 

Total deposits decreased $945.1 million, or 2.7%, from December 31, 2022, primarily due to normal seasonal declines in public funds deposit balances, outflows from seasonal income tax payments and inflationary pressures on customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 77% of all deposits insured by the FDIC or collateralized. We continue to offer reciprocal deposit products to our customers but had less than $260 million in outstanding reciprocal deposit balances at June 30, 2023. Additionally, customer preferences have shifted to certificates of deposits as interest rates increased. 

Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters 

The access to, and cost of, funding for new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. 

The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance and sustainability, changing competitive conditions, regulatory changes or actions, and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence. 

We have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Pursuant to this registration statement, we may, from time to time, issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts or units. On August 25, 2022, we completed an offering of $350 million of 5.150% fixed-rate senior notes due in 2025 under this registration statement. The net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $347.4 million. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the $300 million in 2.200% senior notes that matured in February 2023, investments at the holding company level, capital to support the growth of FNBPA and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness. 

On April 18, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an additional $150 million for the repurchase of our common stock through our existing share repurchase program bringing the total authorization to $300 million. Since inception, we repurchased 14.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $11.39 for $160.9 million under this repurchase program, with $139.1 million remaining for repurchase. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases beginning January 1, 2023. 

Capital management is a continuous process, with capital plans and stress testing for FNB and FNBPA updated at least annually. These capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of 2-3 years beyond the current year. From time to time, we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans. We may issue additional preferred or common stock to maintain our well-capitalized status. 

FNB and FNBPA are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies (see discussion under &#8220;Enhanced Regulatory Capital Standards&#8221;). Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require FNB and FNBPA to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, tier 1 and CET1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of leverage ratio (as defined). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions, by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, dividends and future business and corporate strategies. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, FNB and FNBPA must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. FNB&#8217;s and FNBPA&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

At June 30, 2023, the capital levels of both FNB and FNBPA exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. 

In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing bank holding companies (BHCs) and banks, including FNB, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL over a three-year period. In March 2020, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that became effective on March 31, 2020, and provides BHCs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the impact of CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology for the ACL, on regulatory capital. We have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. As a result, under the final rule, we delayed recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extended through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we were required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Under the final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire day-one impact at adoption plus 25% of the subsequent change in the ACL during the two-year deferral period. As of 

June 30, 2023, the total deferred impact on CET1 capital related to our adoption of CECL was approximately $34.4 million, or 10 basis points, which will continue to be reduced by approximately $17.2 million annually. 

In this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment, we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations, including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like the current conditions. Under these scenarios, the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels, demonstrating our expected ability to continue to support our constituencies under stressful financial conditions. 

Following are the capital amounts and related ratios for FNB and FNBPA:

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) 

The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight, creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Supervision and Regulation&#8221; included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY 

Our primary liquidity management goal is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of FNB with cost-effective funding. Our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with long-term goals, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk, a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; Balance Sheet and appropriate levels of liquidity. Our Board of Directors has also established Liquidity and Contingency Funding Policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify, measure, monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions. These policies designate our ALCO as the body responsible for meeting these objectives. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect Balance Sheet or cash flow positions. Liquidity is centrally managed daily by our Treasury Department. Liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments, as well as the ability to securitize, pledge or sell loans, investment securities and other assets. Liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of FNBPA in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements. FNB also has access to reliable and cost-effective wholesale sources of liquidity. Short- and long-term funds are available for use to help fund normal business operations, and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if faced with a liquidity crisis. 

The principal sources of the parent company&#8217;s liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends and interest it receives from its subsidiaries. These dividends may be impacted by the parent&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; capital needs, statutory laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions, profitability and other factors. In addition, through one of our subsidiaries, we regularly issue subordinated notes, which are guaranteed by FNB. The parent company's cash position at June 30, 2023 was $355.2 million, down $299.1 million from year-end, primarily due to the scheduled repayment of $300 million in Senior Notes due in February 2023. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed a Senior Debt offering for $347.7 million in net proceeds. A portion of these proceeds were used to retire debt maturing in February of 2023 (for additional information, see Note 10, "Borrowings" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report). Management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parent's funding needs. In May, we purchased and retired $15 million par value of the 7.625% Subordinated Notes due August 12, 2023. 

Two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent company&#8217;s cash position are the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Months of Cash on Hand (MCH). The LCR is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next 12 months divided by projected cash outflows over the next 12 months. The MCH is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the existing cash on hand. 

The LCR and MCH ratios are presented in the following table: 

TABLE 26 

June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Internal Limit Liquidity coverage ratio 2.7 times 1.7 times &#62; 1 time Months of cash on hand 16.7 months 13.6 months &#62; 12 months 

Management has concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment. 

Over time, our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationship-based accounts. Organic growth in low-cost transaction deposits was complemented by management&#8217;s continued strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers, in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities. Consistent with industry trends, we have experienced a noticeable shift in deposits from non-interest bearing deposits, checking and money markets into certificates of deposits (CDs). The March 2023 banking disruption caused an acceleration of this shift. Total deposits decreased $945.1 million, or 2.7%, from 

December 31, 2022, primarily due to normal seasonal declines in public funds and other corporate deposit balances as well as outflows from seasonal income tax payments and inflationary pressures on customers. From March 8, 2023 to June 30, 2023, total deposit balances decreased by $592 million, or 1.7%, largely due to normal wholesale and retail customer activity. We ended the quarter with approximately 76% of deposits insured by the FDIC or collateralized, an improvement from approximately 74% at December 31, 2022. Non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts decreased $1.0 billion, or 8.4%. Interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $1.3 billion, or 8.5% and savings account balances decreased $384.1 million, or 9.3%, while time deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 47.7%, as customers' preferences have shifted back to CDs as interest rates have increased substantially. In an abundance of caution related to the banking industry disruption, we added cash on the balance sheet by utilizing wholesale borrowings including advances from the FHLB and overnight borrowings in the Fed Funds market, which also, in part, supported loan growth and covered the deposit decline. Our cash balances held at the FRB increased $105.8 million from December 31, 2022 to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2023. Management will continue to evaluate appropriate levels of liquidity based on expected loan and deposit growth and other balance sheet activity. 

We continue to have ample unused borrowing capacity that could cover 1.9 times of the uninsured deposit and non-collateralized deposit balances as of June 30, 2023. A portion of this capacity includes the FRB's Discount Window and their newly created BTFP. We have no borrowings under either facility. Additional sources of unused wholesale credit availability for FNBPA include the ability to borrow from the FHLB, correspondent bank lines, and access to other channels. In addition to credit availability, FNBPA also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs. We currently have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements. At June 30, 2023, we have $2.2 billion of cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities representing 4.9% of total assets. This compares to a policy minimum of 3.0%. 

The following table presents certain information relating to FNBPA&#8217;s credit availability and salable unpledged securities: 

TABLE 27 

(dollars in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Unused wholesale credit availability $ 15,279 &#160; $ 15,669 Unused wholesale credit availability as a % of FNBPA assets 34.4 &#160; % 35.9 % Salable unpledged government and agency securities $ 957 &#160; $ 592 Salable unpledged government and agency securities as a % of FNBPA assets 2.2 &#160; % 1.4 % Cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities as a % of FNBPA assets 4.9 &#160; % 3.9 % 

Another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis. The following liquidity gap analysis as of June 30, 2023 compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over future time intervals. Management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations. A reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis. A positive gap position means that more assets are expected to mature over the next 12 months than liabilities. The twelve-month cumulative gap to total assets ratio was (0.5)% as of June 30, 2023, compared to 3.8% as of December 31, 2022. The change in the twelve-month cumulative gap to total assets was primarily related to the active management of deposit pricing across the deposit product maturity tenors which reduced our asset sensitivity. Management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed regularly by ALCO. 

TABLE 28 

(dollars in millions) Within 1 Month 2-3 Months 4-6 Months 7-12 Months Total 1 Year Assets Loans $ 767 $ 1,442 $ 1,934 $ 3,429 $ 7,572 Investments 1,341 172 287 474 2,274 2,108 1,614 2,221 3,903 9,846 Liabilities Non-maturity deposits 289 577 866 1,732 3,464 Time deposits 654 659 1,056 2,115 4,484 Borrowings 1,332 126 118 546 2,122 2,275 1,362 2,040 4,393 10,070 Period Gap (Assets - Liabilities) $ (167) $ 252 $ 181 $ (490) $ (224) Cumulative Gap $ (167) $ 85 $ 266 $ (224) Cumulative Gap to Total Assets (0.4) % 0.2 % 0.6 % (0.5) % 

In addition, the ALCO regularly monitors various liquidity ratios, stress scenarios of our liquidity position and assumptions considering market disruptions, lending demand, deposit behavior, and funding availability. The stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions. Management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit-taking activities as a financial intermediary. To succeed in this capacity, we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers. These products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another. For example, depositors may want short-term deposits, while borrowers may desire long-term loans. 

Changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments, cash flows and net interest income. Subject to its ongoing oversight, the Board of Directors has given ALCO the responsibility for market risk management, which involves devising policy guidelines, risk measures and limits, and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. We use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. 

Interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios. Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices, which do not always change by the same amount. Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered. Options risk arises from &#8220;embedded options&#8221; within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans, which may be with or without penalty, when rates change, while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early, which may be with or without penalty, when rates change. 

We use an asset/liability model to measure our interest rate risk. Interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation, EVE and gap analysis. Gap analysis and EVE are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business. Gap analysis, while a helpful diagnostic tool, displays cash flows for only a single rate environment. EVE&#8217;s long-term horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longer-term positions. However, EVE&#8217;s liquidation perspective does not translate into the earnings-based measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern. Net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest. In these simulations, our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios. The ALCO regularly reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios. Reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile, which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies. 

The following repricing gap analysis as of June 30, 2023 compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time. Management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and EVE risk measures.

The twelve-month cumulative repricing gap to total assets was 16.4% and 8.4% as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interest-bearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months. The change in the cumulative repricing gap at June 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, is primarily related to customers moving into higher yielding deposit products and shorter-term time deposits. 

The allocation of non-maturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the one-month maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates. For example, if a product&#8217;s rate is estimated to increase by 50% as much as the market rates, then 50% of the account balance was placed in this category. 

Using a static Balance Sheet structure and utilizing net interest income simulations, the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion. The variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and EVE calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and EVE that was calculated assuming market rates as of June 30, 2023. The measures do not reflect management's potential actions. 

The following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and EVE to changes in interest rates using rate shocks:

We also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months (Rate Ramps) and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve. The comparative percentages are based on the projected base net interest income at the respective measurement dates. Assuming a static Balance Sheet, a +100 basis point Rate Ramp increases net interest income (12 months) by 2.4% at June 30, 2023 and 0.5% at December 31, 2022. For a +200 basis point Rate Ramp, net interest income (12 months) increases by 4.8% at June 30, 2023 and 2.0% at December 31, 2022. The corresponding metrics for a minus 100 basis point Rate Ramp are 0.7% and 0.6% at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These results use historical long-term deposit rate beta assumptions that are regularly analyzed and adjusted as necessary for both rising and falling rate scenarios. The drivers of the positive change in net interest income in the down rate scenarios include a June 30, 2023 starting point for deposit rates that is higher than comparable historical periods, the recent mix shift into higher beta deposit products and the increased level of shorter-term borrowings. Management's intention is to manage to a more neutral position given the current market expectations for future rates. 

The FOMC increased the Federal Funds rate 425 basis points in 2022 and 75 basis points in the first six months of 2023. Forty-seven percent of our net loans and leases are indexed to short-term LIBOR, SOFR, Prime and other indices that will benefit from higher rates as they reprice within the next three months. Our cash position has also been a significant factor in our asset sensitivity metrics. Projected base net interest income has decreased from year-end as deposit rates have increased faster than asset repricing indices. 

There are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income. These include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve, the competitive landscape and expectations regarding future interest rates, as well as internal factors regarding product offerings, product mix and pricing of loans and deposits. 

Management continues to be proactive in managing our interest rate risk (IRR) position with the intention to manage to a more neutral position given the current market expectations for future rates. During 2023, management has adjusted the IRR position by managing cash balances, originating higher yielding loans, strategically meeting our customer preferences for higher yielding deposit products, in particular, shorter term time deposits, and utilizing borrowings of varying maturities. We also utilize derivatives to manage the IRR position. We continue to make use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers (commercial swaps) to manage our IRR position as the commercial swaps effectively increase our level of adjustable-rate loans. Total variable and adjustable-rate loans were 60.6% of total net loans and leases as of June 30, 2023 and 60.2% as of December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the commercial swaps totaled $5.4 billion of notional principal, with $467 million in original notional swap principal originated during the first six months of 2023, up from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we regularly sell long-term fixed-rate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with short-term repricing characteristics. For additional information regarding interest rate swaps, see Note 11, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. 

We recognize that all asset/liability models have some inherent shortcomings. Asset/liability models require certain assumptions to be made, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and repricing impact on non-maturity deposits, which may differ from actual experience. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans, economic and market trends and available industry data. While management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable, there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved. Furthermore, the metrics are based upon the Balance Sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

As a financial institution, we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision, transaction and activity. Our Board of Directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk and strategic risk. In its oversight role of our risk management function, the Board of Directors focuses on the strategies, analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying, understanding and managing risks to optimize total shareholder value, while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations. 

The Board of Directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns. As such, the board monitors a series of KRIs, or Key Risk Indicators, for various business lines, operational units, and risk categories, providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite. These results are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement, and where appropriate, adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks. Modifications to the risk appetite statement are also reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our overall business strategy and stated risk tolerances. 

We support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our Board of Directors and senior management. The joint Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the FNBPA Board of Directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances. The Risk Committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following: 

&#8226; identification, measurement, assessment and monitoring of enterprise-wide risk; 

&#8226; development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies; 

&#8226; review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory and operating risk (including technology, operational, compliance and fiduciary risks); and 

&#8226; identification and implementation of risk management best practices. 

The Risk Committee serves as the primary point of contact between our Board of Directors and the Risk Management Council, which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management. Risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our Board Risk Committee and Risk Management Council. We use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance tactics, while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Our top-down risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risk-taking for bottom-up planning from our various business functions. Our Board Risk Committee, in collaboration with our Risk Management Council, approves our risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently, as needed to reflect changes in the risk, regulatory, economic and strategic plan environments, with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations, regulatory environment and our shareholders' expectations. Reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans, and our ongoing monitoring thereof, are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our Board Risk Committee. 

As noted above, we have a Risk Management Council comprised of senior management. The purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. Management has also established an Operational Risk Committee that is responsible for identifying, evaluating and monitoring operational risks across FNB, evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the Risk Management Council. The Risk Management Council reports on a 

regular basis to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors regarding our enterprise-wide risk profile and other significant risk management issues. Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas, including the following departments, which all report to the Chief Risk Officer to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a day-to-day basis: 

&#8226; Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Department - conducts risk and control assessments across all our business and operational areas to ensure the appropriate risk identification, risk management and reporting of risks enterprise wide. 

&#8226; Fraud Risk Department - monitors for internal and external fraud risk across all our business and operational units. 

&#8226; Loan Review Department - conducts independent testing of our loan risk ratings to ensure their accuracy, which is instrumental to calculating our ACL. 

&#8226; Model Risk Management Department - oversees validation and testing of all models used in managing risk across our company. 

&#8226; Third-Party Risk Management Department - ensures effective risk management and oversight of third-party relationships throughout the vendor life cycle. 

&#8226; Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act Department - monitors for compliance with money laundering risk and associated regulatory compliance requirements. 

&#8226; Appraisal Review Department - facilitates independent ordering and review of real estate appraisals obtained for determining the value of real estate pledged as collateral for loans to customers. 

&#8226; Compliance Department - develops policies and procedures and monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations which govern our business operations. 

&#8226; Information and Cyber Security Department - maintains a risk assessment of our information and cybersecurity risks and ensures appropriate controls are in place to manage and control such risks, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework for improving critical infrastructure by measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of information and cybersecurity controls. This department also oversees our disaster recovery planning and testing efforts to allow us to be capable and ready for business resumption in the event of a disaster. 

We have in place various business and emergency continuity plans to respond to different crises and circumstances which include rapid deployment of our Crisis Management Team, Incident Management Team and Business Continuity Coordinators to activate our plans for various types of emergency circumstances. Further, our audit function performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our Audit Committee. Each of the Risk, Audit, Credit Risk and CRA Committees of our Board of Directors regularly report on risk-related matters to the full Board of Directors. In addition, both the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and our Risk Management Council regularly assess our enterprise-wide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues. 

The Board of Directors believes that our enterprise-wide risk management process is effective and enables the Board of Directors to: 

&#8226; assess the quality of the information they receive; 

&#8226; understand the businesses, investments and financial, accounting, legal, regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that FNB faces; 

&#8226; oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk; and 

&#8226; assess appropriately the quality of our enterprise-wide risk management processes. 

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO GAAP 

Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures and key performance indicators discussed in this Report to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the following tables.

The table above shows how operating net income available to common stockholders (non-GAAP) is derived from amounts reported in our financial statements. We believe certain charges, such as merger expenses, initial provision for non-PCD loans acquired and branch consolidation costs are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. The merger expenses and branch consolidation costs principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction, and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction.
