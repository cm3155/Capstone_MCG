 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 

OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 8 of this Report. Results of operations for the periods included in this review are not necessarily indicative of results to be obtained during any future period. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

We make statements in this Report and may from time-to-time make other statements regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset quality levels, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations. These statements can be considered as &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward&#8209;looking statements involve various assumptions, risks and uncertainties which can change over time. Actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and may not align with historical performance and events. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "plan," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "will," "should," "project," "goal," and other similar words and expressions. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws. 

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Our business, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) developments with respect to the U.S. and global financial markets; (ii) actions by the FRB, UST, OCC and other governmental agencies, especially those that impact money supply, market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry; (iii) a slowing or reversal of current U.S. economic environment; and (iv) the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the U.S. or its global trading partners. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, and on credit spreads, deposit gathering and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and continue to respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, significant political events, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally, or on us or our counterparties specifically. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Legal, regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and the ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include: 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Changes resulting from a change in the U.S. presidential administration or legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to FNB. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates, assumptions and judgments of management and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 

The most significant accounting policies followed by FNB are presented in Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, provide information on how we value significant assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements, how we determine those values and how we record transactions in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management currently views the determination of the allowance for credit losses, accounting for loans acquired in a business combination, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and deferred tax assets and litigation reserves to be critical accounting policies. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses addresses credit losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit at the balance sheet date and is presented as a reserve against loans and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Management&#8217;s assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses considers individual impaired loans, pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics and other risk factors concerning the economic environment. These analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific impaired loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows, current fair value of the underlying collateral and other qualitative risk factors that may affect the loan, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. 

Loans with similar risk characteristics are categorized into pools based on loan type and by internal risk rating for commercial loans, or payment performance and credit score for consumer loans. There is judgment involved in setting internal commercial risk ratings, including an evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s current financial condition and ability to repay the loan. Transition matrices are generated on a monthly basis to determine probabilities of default, while historical loss experience is used to generate loss given default results for the pools. Inherent but undetected losses may arise due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower&#8217;s financial condition, the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors. Uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss. The historical loss experience used in the transition matrices and historical loss experience analysis may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio. 

Management evaluates the impact of various qualitative factors which pose additional risks that may not be adequately addressed in the analyses described above. Expected loss rates for each loan category may be adjusted for levels of and trends in loan volumes, net charge-offs, delinquency and non-performing loans. In addition, management takes into consideration the impact of changes to lending policies; the experience and depth of lending management and staff; the results of internal loan reviews; concentrations of credit; competition, legal and regulatory risk; market uncertainty and collateral illiquidity; national and local economic trends; or any other common risk factor that might affect loss experience across one or more components of 

the portfolio. Economic factors influencing management&#8217;s estimate of allowance for credit losses include, but are not limited to, uncertainty of the labor markets, industrial presence, commercial real estate activity and residential real estate values. The determination of this qualitative component of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and is particularly dependent on the judgment of management. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provisions for credit losses could be required that may affect our earnings or financial position in future periods. 

The Provision for Credit Losses section in the Results of Operations includes a discussion of the factors affecting changes in the allowance for credit losses during the current period. See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 5, &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the allowance for credit losses. 

Accounting for Loans Acquired in a Business Combination 

All loans acquired in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of loans acquired in a business combination is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, default rates, loss severity, collateral values, discount rates, prepayment speeds, prepayment risk and liquidity risk. The measurement of fair value on loans acquired in a business combination prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses at acquisition date. 

Loans acquired in a business combination are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable at time of acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected. The present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for credit losses. 

For acquired non-impaired loans, including revolving loans (lines of credit and credit card loans) and leases that are excluded from acquired impaired loan accounting, the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the contractual amounts due at the acquisition date represents the fair value adjustment. Fair value adjustments may be discounts (or premiums) to a loan&#8217;s cost basis and are accreted (or amortized) to interest income over the loan&#8217;s remaining life using the level yield method. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, we record a provision for credit losses only when the required allowance exceeds the remaining fair value adjustment. 

These estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, the outcome may affect our earnings or financial position in future periods. 

See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 5, &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of accounting for loans acquired in a business combination. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures. Additionally, from time to time we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a non-recurring basis, such as loans held for sale, certain impaired loans, OREO and certain other assets. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements includes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Judgment is required to determine which level of the three-level hierarchy certain assets or liabilities measured at fair value are classified. 

Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use significant and complex estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Where available, fair value and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets or liabilities is based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists. When such third-party information is not available, we may estimate fair value by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Our assumptions about what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability is developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the fair value estimates over the life of the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. 

See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 24, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of accounting for financial instruments. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

As a result of acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. Our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our Community Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance segments. 

The value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality, cost-effective services in the face of competition. As such, these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value, which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods. 

Goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which must be conducted at least annually. We perform impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts, as necessary. 

Determining fair values of each reporting unit, of its individual assets and liabilities, and also of other identifiable intangible assets requires considering market information that is publicly available, as well as the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Inputs used in determining fair values where significant estimates and assumptions are necessary include discounted cash flow calculations, market comparisons and recent transactions, projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, long-term growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables. 

See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 9, &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

We are subject to the income tax laws of federal, state and other taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business. The laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities. In determining the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex tax statutes, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing our tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities or based on management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law. 

We determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net DTA or DTL is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and recognizes the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. That effect would be included in income in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change. See the Results of Operations, Income Taxes section later in this MD&#38;A for further tax-related discussion. 

On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on management&#8217;s current best estimate of pretax earnings and the applicable taxes for the full year. DTAs and DTLs are assessed on an annual basis, or sooner, if business events or circumstances warrant. Deferred income taxes represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. 

We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a benefit from our DTAs, or when future deductibility is uncertain. Periodically, the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on management&#8217;s assessments of realizable DTAs. 

See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 18, &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of accounting for income taxes. 

Litigation Reserves 

The Corporation is involved in various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. These claims result from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. Although the ultimate outcome for any asserted claim cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the Corporation has valid defenses for all asserted claims. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we, in conjunction with internal and outside counsel handling the matter, record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. We continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has previously been established. 

Litigation expense represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and factors outside of our control. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our financial liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate. See our policy on establishing accruals for litigation in Note 15, "Commitments, Credit Risk and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments 

Note 2, &#8220;New Accounting Standards&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report, discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by us in 2019 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 

To supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating earnings per diluted common share, return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, efficiency ratio and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. When non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed, the SEC's Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included later in this report under the heading &#8220;Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators to GAAP&#8221;. 

Management believes charges such as merger expenses, branch consolidation costs, certain service charge refunds and special one-time 401(k) contributions related to tax reform are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. These charges are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities. The merger expenses and branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. Similarly, gains derived from the sale of a business are not organic to our operations. 

To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio, we use net interest income on a taxable- equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets (loans and investments) to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments (this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP). Taxable-equivalent amounts for the 2019 and 2018 periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21% provided under the TCJA (effective January 1, 2018). Amounts for the 2017 periods were calculated using the previously applicable statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 

For 2019 , net income available to common stockholders was a record $379.2 million or $1.16 per diluted common share, compared to $364.8 million or $1.12 per diluted common share for 2018 . We also achieved record non-interest income with significant contributions across our fee businesses of capital markets, mortgage banking, trust and insurance. Despite a challenging interest rate environment where the FOMC lowered the target Fed Funds rate by 75 basis points in 2019, we achieved record revenue of $1.2 billion , an increase of 0.3% from 2018 . During 2019 , $4.5 million of branch consolidation costs and $4.3 million of service charge refunds impacted pretax earnings. In 2019 , we continued to focus on expense management, while investing in technology, infrastructure and our people. During 2018, the $5.1 million gain from the sale of Regency, branch consolidation costs of $6.6 million and a $0.9 million discretionary 401(k) contribution following tax reform impacted pretax earnings. 

We delivered solid loan and deposit growth, while maintaining our risk profile. Credit quality trends remained positive and we ended a successful 2019 in a more favorable capital position. Tangible book value (non-GAAP) increased 13% , while we returned nearly $160 million in dividends to our shareholders. T he ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP) increased 53 basis points to 7.58% .

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

The average balances and yields earned on securities are based on historical cost. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

The interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) 

Average balances include non-accrual loans. Loans and leases consist of average total loans less average unearned income. 

##TABLE_END 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $931.4 million for 2019 decreased $14.4 million , or 1.5% , from $945.8 million for 2018 . Average interest-earning assets increased $1.4 billion , or 5.1% , and average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.0 billion , or 4.9% , from 2018 , due to organic growth in loans and deposits and benefits from our expanded banking footprint in our southeastern markets. Our net interest margin FTE (non-GAAP) was 3.17% for 2019 , compared to 3.39% for 2018 , reflecting the sale of Regency in the third quarter of 2018, a lower level of cash recoveries on acquired loans, higher interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities and impact from the lower interest rate environment. During 2019, we recognized $7.7 million of higher incremental purchase accounting accretion and $10.3 million of lower cash recoveries compared to 2018. Incremental purchase accounting accretion refers to the difference between total accretion and the estimated coupon interest income on loans acquired in a business combination. Additionally, Regency contributed $22.5 million or 0.08% to net interest margin in 2018. The FOMC lowered the target Fed Funds rate by 75 basis points in 2019 . 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volume and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated:

The amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35.0% in 2017. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

##TABLE_END Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $1.3 billion for 2019 , increased $77.7 million or 6.6% from 2018 , primarily due to increased interest-earning assets and higher average interest rates. This was partially offset by lower cash recoveries on acquired loans and the lower rate environment in the second half of 2019. During 2019 and 2018 , we recognized $35.9 million and $38.4 million , respectively, in incremental purchase accounting accretion and cash recoveries on loans acquired in business combinations, which included $7.7 million of higher incremental purchase accounting accretion and $10.3 million of lower cash recoveries. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily driven by a $1.2 billion , or 5.5% , increase in average loans and leases, due to solid origination activity across our footprint and successful sales management. Additionally, average securities increased $0.2 billion , or 2.6% , primarily as a result of increases in collateralized mortgage obligations of $466.1 million and states of the U.S. and political subdivisions of $112.3 million, partially offset by a decrease of $393.1 million in mortgage-backed securities. The yield on average interest-earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 6 basis points from 2018 to 4.29% for 2019 . The 6 basis point increase in earning asset yields was driven by an increase in average yields on both investments and loans including higher purchase accounting accretion and lower cash recoveries on loans acquired in business 

combinations. During the second quarter of 2018, we sold underperforming acquired and originated small business loans with a carrying value of $42.5 million, which benefited our overall credit quality, and sold a non-strategic pool of acquired serviced-by-others mortgages with a carrying value of $38.2 million. We recognized approximately $9.4 million in incremental purchase accounting accretion in the second quarter of 2018 related to the serviced-by-others mortgage loan sale. 

Interest expense of $329.8 million for 2019 increased $92.1 million , or 38.7% , from 2018 due to higher average market rates and a change in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities, combined with growth in average interest-bearing liabilities, as interest-bearing deposits and borrowings increased over the same period of 2018 . Average interest-bearing deposits increased $0.9 billion , or 5.6% , reflecting organic growth in personal and commercial relationships. Average short-term borrowings decreased $0.4 billion , or 9.4% , primarily as a result of decreases of $202.2 million in federal funds purchased, $134.6 million in short-term FHLB borrowings, $16.9 million in short-term subordinated notes and $13.0 million in customer repurchase agreements. Average long-term borrowings increased $0.5 billion or 72.8% , which reflects increases of $418.1 million in long-term FHLB borrowings and $80.8 million in subordinated debt, partially offset by a decrease of $32.5 million in junior subordinated debt. The funding of both fixed and adjustable longer-term borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth. During the first quarter of 2019 , we issued $120.0 million of 4.95% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2029. We used part of the proceeds from this issuance to redeem higher-rate debt including $44.0 million in junior subordinated debt and $25.0 million in other subordinated debt. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 36 basis points to 1.46% for 2019 , due primarily to higher average market interest rates. The lower interest rate environment in the second half of 2019 had a favorable impact on average interest-bearing deposit rates in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is determined based on management&#8217;s estimates of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses needed to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The following table presents information regarding the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs for the years 2017 through 2019 :

##TABLE_END

The provision for credit losses of $44.6 million during 2019 decreased $16.7 million from 2018 , primarily due to a decrease of $18.0 million in the provision for the originated portfolio, which was primarily attributable to a lower level of non-performing loans and lower net charge-offs, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in the provision for the acquired portfolio. Net loan charge-offs of $28.3 million for 2019 decreased $27.6 million from 2018 , primarily due to continued strong credit quality results in 2019 and the sale of Regency in the third quarter of 2018.

##TABLE_END

Total non-interest income of $294.3 million for 2019 increased $18.6 million , or 6.8% , from $275.7 million in 2018 . On an operating basis, non-interest income increased $26.1 million , or 9.5% . The variances in significant individual non-interest income items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges on loans and deposits of $124.3 million for 2019 decreased slightly by $1.2 million , or 0.9% , from $125.5 million in 2018 . The decrease was due to a significant item impacting earnings of $4.3 million of service charge refunds offset by organic growth in loan and deposit accounts. 

Trust services of $27.9 million for 2019 increased $2.1 million , or 8.0% , from the same period of 2018 , primarily driven by strong organic revenue production. The market value of assets under management increased $1.0 billion , or 19.7% , to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2019 , reflecting continued strong organic growth in accounts and services in our footprint combined with strong market appreciation. 

Insurance commissions and fees of $20.5 million for 2019 increased $2.2 million , or 11.7% , from $18.3 million in 2018 , primarily due to the benefit of new business in the Mid-Atlantic and Carolina regions of our footprint, as well as organic growth in commercial lines. 

Capital markets income of $33.2 million for 2019 increased $11.9 million , or 55.5% , from $21.4 million for 2018 , reflecting strong customer-related interest rate derivative activity. The significant increase was primarily due to strong derivatives sales activity to commercial customers across our footprint, several new syndication transactions in our Washington D.C. and southeastern markets and continued contributions from our international banking business. 

Mortgage banking operations income of $31.7 million for 2019 increased $9.7 million , or 44.4% , from $21.9 million for 2018 , as higher sold volumes were partially offset by higher MSRs impairment and amortization. During 2019 , we sold $1.7 billion of residential mortgage loans, compared to $1.2 billion for 2018 . Sold loan margins for our originated-for-sale portfolio have increased by 4 basis points from 1.60% in 2018 to 1.64% in 2019 due to mix and higher retail gain on sale margins. In 2019 , retail volume was 44.1% of the total sold volume, compared to 43.7% in 2018 , and we benefited from an expansion in our retail margin of 13 basis points, while correspondent margins have faced competitive pressure and declined 5 basis points in 2019 . During 2019, we recognized $1.1 million in net negative interest-rate related valuation adjustments on MSRs, compared to $0.5 million for 2018. 

Dividends on non-marketable equity securities of $18.6 million for 2019 increased $3.1 million , or 19.9% , from $15.6 million for 2018 , primarily due to an increase in the FHLB dividend rate. 

Income from BOLI of $11.8 million for 2019 decreased $1.7 million , or 12.6% , from $13.5 million in 2018 , primarily due to a large death claim payout during the third quarter of 2018, which resulted in additional income of $1.4 million. 

Other non-interest income was $9.1 million and $16.1 million for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The biggest driver of lower other non-interest income was the $5.1 million gain on the sale of Regency in 2018. We recorded losses on fixed assets related to the branch consolidations of $1.7 million and $3.7 million during 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Additionally, we recognized $3.1 million more in gains on the sale of OREO and $3.8 million less in gains on equity investments, compared to 2018 .

Total non-interest expense of $696.1 million for 2019 increased $1.6 million , or 0.2% , from $694.5 million in 2018 . On an operating basis, non-interest expense increased $2.6 million , or 0.4% . The variances in significant individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits of $375.1 million for 2019 increased $5.5 million , or 1.5% , from $369.6 million in 2018 . The increase was primarily related to higher production-related commissions and normal merit increases, as well as the initiative to increase FNB's minimum wage to $15 per hour. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was partially offset by the impact of the sale of Regency, which was included in the first eight months of 2018. Our total full-time equivalent employees were 4,066 and 4,266 at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense of $120.3 million for 2019 increased $5.2 million , or 4.5% , from $115.1 million in 2018 , primarily due to branch consolidation costs of $2.2 million for 2019 and $1.6 million in 2018, and our continued 

investment in new technology. The increased technology costs included upgrades to meet customer needs via the utilization of electronic delivery channels, such as online and mobile banking, investment in infrastructure to support our larger company and expenditures deemed necessary by management to maintain proficiency and compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Amortization of intangibles expense of $14.2 million for 2019 decreased $1.5 million , or 9.5% , from $15.7 million in 2018 , due to the completion of amortization for a core deposit intangible from a prior acquisition. 

Outside services expense of $64.0 million for 2019 decreased $1.7 million , or 2.6% , from $65.7 million in 2018 , primarily due to decreases of $2.3 million in legal expense and $1.3 million in consulting fees, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million in data processing and information technology services. The legal and consulting fees are primarily lower due to our focus on efficiency and expense control, combined with the sale of Regency, which was included in the first eight months of 2018. 

Bank shares and franchise taxes expense of $12.5 million for 2019 increased $0.6 million , or 4.7% , from $11.9 million in 2018 , primarily due to the increase in our capital level. 

FDIC insurance of $23.3 million for 2019 decreased $9.7 million , or 29.3% , from 2018 , primarily due to the elimination of the FDIC's large bank surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

Other non-interest expense was $86.8 million and $83.6 million for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. During 2019 , loan-related expense and telephone expense increased by $4.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, while OREO expense and insurance benefit expense decreased by $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Additionally, in 2019, there was an impairment charge of $3.2 million from a renewable energy investment tax credit transaction. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized as a benefit to income taxes.

##TABLE_END

Our income tax expense for 2019 increased $4.0 million or 5.1% from 2018 . The effective tax rate was 17.7% for 2019 , compared to 17.6% for 2018 . Both periods' tax rates are lower than the 21.0% federal statutory rate due to the tax benefits resulting from renewable energy investment and historic tax credits, tax-exempt income on investments and loans and income from BOLI. The effective rate for 2017 was significantly higher at 44.1% than the 35% pre-TCJA statutory federal tax rate 

largely due to $54.0 million of income tax expense recorded from the revaluation of net deferred tax assets in connection with the TCJA in 2017. 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill, the TCJA, which provided significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as the reduction of the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA also included other provisions such as the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017. 

On the same date, the SEC issued SAB No. 118, which provided guidance regarding the recognition of the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA for the reporting period in which the TCJA was enacted. SAB No. 118 expresses the view that a company must first reflect the income tax effect of the TCJA in the period of enactment on items for which the accounting is complete (these completed amounts would not be provisional) and also report provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the TCJA for which reasonable estimates can be determined. We recorded a provisional amount of $54.0 million at December 31, 2017 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. Upon final analysis of available information and refinement of our calculations during 2018, we decreased our provisional amount by $1.9 million which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. We consider the TCJA remeasurement of our deferred taxes to be complete. 

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Refer to the MD&#38;A in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019 for a comparison of the years ended 2018 versus 2017 .

##TABLE_END Additional information relating to originated loans and loans acquired in a business combination is provided in Note 5, &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. 

Total loans and leases increased $1.1 billion , or 5.1% , to $23.3 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $22.2 billion at December 31, 2018 , led by strong commercial loan activity, combined with increases in the residential mortgage and indirect installment portfolios. 

Total loans and leases increased $1.2 billion , or 5.5% , to $22.2 billion at December 31, 2018 , compared to $21.0 billion at December 31, 2017 , led by strong commercial loan activity and continued growth in the equipment finance and asset-based lending businesses. Additionally, we experienced strong growth in our residential mortgage and indirect installment portfolios. 

As of December 31, 2019 , 30.6% of the commercial real estate loans were owner-occupied, while the remaining 69.4% were non-owner-occupied, compared to 35.1% and 64.9% , respectively, as of December 31, 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had commercial construction loans of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively, representing 5.5% and 5.2% of total loans and leases, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had residential construction loans of $297.3 million and $273.4 million , respectively, representing 1.3% and 1.2% of total loans and leases, respectively. 

Within our primary lending footprint, certain industries are more predominant given the geographic location of these lending markets. We strive to maintain a diverse commercial loan portfolio by avoiding undue concentrations or exposures to any particular sector, and we actively monitor our commercial loan portfolio to ensure that our industry mix is consistent with our risk appetite and within targeted thresholds. Several factors are taken into consideration when determining these thresholds, including recent economic and market trends. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , there were no concentrations of loans relating to any industry in excess of 10% of total loans.

For additional information relating to lending activity, see Note 5, &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. 

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and non-performing TDRs. Past due loans are reviewed on a monthly basis to identify loans for non-accrual status. We place a loan on non-accrual status and discontinue interest accruals on originated loans generally when principal or interest is due and has remained unpaid for a certain number of days, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans are placed on non-accrual at 90 days, installment loans are placed 

on non-accrual at 120 days and residential mortgages and consumer lines of credit are generally placed on non-accrual at 180 days. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Non-accrual loans may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest have been paid and the ultimate ability to collect the remaining principal and interest is reasonably assured. TDRs are loans in which the borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms due to financial distress. 

During 2019 , non-performing assets decreased $6.9 million . This reflects an increase of $2.2 million in non-accrual loans and decreases of $0.3 million in TDRs and $9.4 million in OREO. The increase in non-accrual loans is attributable to the migration of three commercial credit relationships to non-accrual during 2019. The decrease in OREO reflects sales activity of the remaining Florida land projects totaling $13.2 million. 

During 2018 , non-performing assets decreased $3.2 million. This reflects an increase of $4.5 million in non-accrual loans and decreases of $2.2 million in TDRs and $5.6 million in OREO. The increase in non-accrual loans is attributable to the migration of a few commercial loans, partially offset by the commercial note sale that occurred during the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in TDRs is related to the sale of Regency, which resulted in a decrease of $2.7 million in TDRs. The decrease in OREO was primarily attributable to the sale of two commercial properties totaling $2.4 million during 2018.

##TABLE_END

TDRs are loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs typically result from loss mitigation activities and could include the extension of a maturity date, 

interest rate reduction, principal forgiveness, deferral or decrease in payments for a period of time and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. 

TDRs that are accruing and performing include loans for which we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of the expected cash flows on such loans and for which we expect to fully collect the new carrying value of the loans. TDRs that are accruing and non-performing are comprised of loans that have not demonstrated a consistent repayment pattern on the modified terms for more than six months, however it is expected that we will collect all future principal and interest payments. TDRs that are on non-accrual are not placed on accruing status until all delinquent principal and interest have been paid and the ultimate ability to collect the remaining principal and interest is reasonably assured. Some loan modifications classified as TDRs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest, as modified, and may result in incremental losses which are factored into the allowance for credit losses estimate. Additional information related to our TDRs is included in Note 5, &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. 

Following is a summary of performing, non-performing and non-accrual originated TDRs, by class:

The increase in loans and leases 90 days or more past due and accruing in 2017 was primarily the result of the YDKN acquisition. Loans acquired in a business combination that are 90 days or more past due are considered to be accruing since we can reasonably estimate future cash flows and we expect to fully collect the carrying value of these loans. The loans acquired in a business combination were discounted and marked to fair value with interest income recognized via accretion in accordance with GAAP. 

Following is a table showing the amounts of contractual interest income and actual interest income related to non-accrual loans and non-performing TDRs:

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at a specific point in time. This estimate includes losses associated with specifically identified loans, as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. Additions are made to the allowance for credit losses through both periodic provisions charged to income and recoveries of losses previously recorded. Reductions to the allowance for credit losses occur as loans are charged off. Additional information related to our policy for our allowance for credit losses is included in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of this financial review and in Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report.

##TABLE_END

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 increased $16.2 million or 9.0% from December 31, 2018, in response to growth in originated loans and some migration in the commercial and indirect portfolios. The provision for credit losses during 2019 was $44.6 million , which covered net charge-offs and supported organic loan growth. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2018 increased $4.3 million or 2.4% from December 31, 2017, in response to growth in originated loans and leases and a small increase in originated criticized commercial loans. The provision for credit losses during 2018 was $61.2 million, which covered net charge-offs and supported organic loan growth. The amount of provision expense that resulted from the small increase in originated criticized commercial loans was offset by a provision benefit received through a decline in the overall delinquency and non-performing loan level in 2018. Net charge-offs were $56.0 million, or 0.26% of average loans, compared to $43.8 million, or 0.22% of average loans, in 2017, with the increase primarily due to $13.4 million, or 6 basis points, relating to the sale of a small portfolio of non-performing loans in the second quarter of 2018 and the sale of Regency in the third quarter of 2018. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2017 increased $17.3 million or 11.0% from December 31, 2016, primarily in support of organic loan growth and to a lesser extent, moderate credit migration in commercial and industrial. The provision for credit losses for 2017 was $61.1 million, compared to $55.8 million in 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $43.8 million, or 0.22% of average loans, compared to $39.7 million, or 0.28% of average loans, in 2016. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2016 increased $16.1 million, or 11.3%, from December 31, 2015, primarily in support of organic loan growth and credit migration. The provision for credit losses for 2016 was $55.8 million, due to organic loan growth and net charge-offs of $39.7 million, which included a $4.0 million charge-off from a single commercial relationship involving a borrower alleged to have falsified documents and financial information over an extended period of time, and credit migration. 

The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2015 increased $16.1 million, or 12.8%, from December 31, 2014, as the provision for credit losses for 2015 of $40.4 million exceeded net charge-offs of $24.4 million, with the remainder supporting loan growth in the originated portfolio and some credit migration within the commercial and industrial and indirect installment portfolios. 

Following is a summary of the allocation of the allowance for credit losses and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans:

##TABLE_END

During 2019, the allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans increased to support organic loan growth and $2.6 million of additional specific reserves, and indirect installment increased due to an increase in early stage delinquency. Additionally, the increases in residential mortgages and commercial leases support organic loan growth. 

During 2018, the allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, commercial leases, residential mortgages and indirect installment loans all increased to support organic loan growth. The allowance for credit losses allocated to direct installment loans decreased as a result of the sale of Regency. The allowance for credit losses allocated to other loans acquired in a business combination decreased due to improved credit quality. 

During 2017, the allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial real estate, residential mortgages and indirect loans all increased to support organic loan growth. The allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial and industrial increased to support organic growth and moderate credit migration. 

During 2016, the allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial loans increased to support organic loan growth, as well as migration within the commercial and industrial portfolio, which was impacted by the continued softness in the commodity 

industries, that adversely impacted certain borrowers operating in this area. The allowance for credit losses allocated to residential mortgages increased during 2016 largely due to organic growth within that portfolio. 

During 2015, the allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans increased to support organic loan growth, while a portion of the allocated commercial and industrial and indirect installment allowance for credit losses also supported some limited credit migration within those portfolios. The allowance for credit losses allocated to residential mortgages decreased slightly during this same period, which was the result of growth-related reserves being more than offset by general improvements in asset quality within that portfolio. The allowance for credit losses allocated to loans acquired in a business combination decreased during the year as a result of favorable quarterly cash flow re-estimation results and problem credit resolution, with the PVF Capital Corp., ANNB, and Comm Bancorp, Inc. portfolios driving the decrease. 

Investment Activity 

Investment activities serve to enhance net interest income while supporting interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions. Securities purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are categorized as securities HTM and carried at amortized cost. All other securities are categorized as securities AFS and are recorded at fair value. Securities, like loans, are subject to similar interest rate and credit risk. In addition, by their nature, securities classified as AFS are also subject to fair value risks that could negatively affect the level of liquidity available to us, as well as stockholders&#8217; equity. A change in the value of securities HTM could also negatively affect the level of stockholders&#8217; equity if there was a decline in the underlying creditworthiness of the issuers and an OTTI is deemed to have occurred or if there was a change in our intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. 

As of December 31, 2019 , debt securities classified as AFS and HTM each totaled $3.3 billion . During 2019 , debt securities AFS decreased by $52.4 million and debt securities HTM increased by $21.4 million from December 31, 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we did not hold any trading securities.

Total deposits increased during 2019 , primarily as a result of growth in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand balances that were partially offset by a decrease in certificates and other time deposits, resulting from a managed decline in brokered certificate balances. Generating growth in relationship-based transaction deposits remains a key focus for us and will help us manage to lower levels of short-term borrowings.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term. Short-term borrowings, made up of customer repurchase agreements (also referred to as securities sold under repurchase agreements), FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and subordinated notes, decreased to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019 from $4.1 billion at December 31, 2018 , primarily due to a decrease of $1.0 billion in federal funds purchased.

Capital Resources 

The access to, and cost of, funding for new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. 

The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions, regulatory changes or actions and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence. 

We have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Pursuant to this registration statement, we may, from time to time, issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts or units. On February 14, 2019, we completed an offering of $120.0 million of 4.95% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2029 under this registration statement. The subordinated notes are treated as tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $118.2 million. We have used the net proceeds from the sale of the subordinated notes to redeem higher-rate long-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes. 

On February 24, 2020, we completed an offering of $300.0 million of 2.20% fixed rate senior notes due in 2023 under this registration statement. The net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately $297.9 million. We will use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, which may include investments at the holding company level, capital to support the growth of FNBPA, repurchase of our common shares and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness. 

On September 23, 2019 we announced that the Board of Directors had approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $150 million of our common stock. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. The repurchase program is expected to continue through the end of 2020. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time. 

Capital management is a continuous process with capital plans and stress testing for FNB and FNBPA updated at least annually. These capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of 2-3 years beyond the current year. Both FNB and FNBPA are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. For additional information, see Note 21, &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. From time to time, we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans. We may issue additional preferred or common stock in order to maintain our well-capitalized status.

##TABLE_END

Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements because while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. Additionally, a significant portion of these commitments can be terminated by FNB. For additional information relating to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, see Note 15, &#8220;Commitments, Credit Risk and Contingencies&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. 

LIQUIDITY 

Our goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of FNB with cost-effective funding. Our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with long-term goals, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk, a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; Balance Sheet and adequate levels of liquidity. Our Board of Directors has also established Liquidity and Contingency Funding Policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify, measure, monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions. These policies designate our Asset/Liability Committee as the body responsible for meeting these objectives. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect Balance Sheet or cash flow positions. Liquidity is centrally managed daily by our Treasury Department. 

The principal sources of the parent company&#8217;s liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. These dividends may be impacted by the parent&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; capital needs, statutory laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions, profitability and other factors. In addition, through one of our subsidiaries, we regularly issue subordinated notes, which are guaranteed by FNB. Management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parent's funding needs. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed a debt offering in which we issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.95% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2029, which is treated as tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. We used $69.0 million of the net proceeds of the debt offering to redeem, retire or call existing debt and TPS as noted below. We repurchased and retired $9.5 million and redeemed $15.5 million in higher interest rate subordinated debt assumed in the 2017 YDKN acquisition. We redeemed $10.0 million of TPS issued by American Community Capital Trust I also assumed in the 2017 YDKN acquisition. Additionally, we exercised the call options on $26.0 million of Omega Financial Capital Trust I and $8.0 million of Crescent Financial Capital Trust I with April settlements. Lastly, from the net debt issuance proceeds, we completed a capital infusion of $40.0 million to FNBPA in March. These transactions accomplished strategic objectives and were the primary factors resulting in an increase in our liquidity metrics as shown below. 

Management believes our cash levels are appropriate given the current environment. Two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent company&#8217;s cash position are the LCR and MCH. The LCR is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next 12 months divided by projected cash outflows over the next 12 months. The MCH is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand. 

The LCR and MCH ratios are presented in the following table:

##TABLE_END

FNBPA generates liquidity from its normal business operations. Liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments, as well as the ability to securitize, pledge or sell loans, investment securities and other assets. Liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of FNBPA in the form of deposits. FNB also has access to 

reliable and cost-effective wholesale sources of liquidity. Short- and long-term funds are used to help fund normal business operations, and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we are faced with a liquidity crisis. 

Our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationship-based accounts. Organic growth in low-cost transaction deposits was complemented by management&#8217;s strategy of heightened deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers, in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities. Total deposits were $24.8 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $1.3 billion , or 5.7% , from December 31, 2018 . Total non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts grew $384.0 million , or 6.4% , total interest-bearing demand deposit accounts grew $1.4 billion , or 14.4% , savings accounts grew $99.3 million , or 3.9% , and time deposits decreased $541.0 million , or 10.3% . 

FNBPA has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the FHLB, the FRB, correspondent bank lines, access to brokered deposits and multiple other channels. In addition to credit availability, FNBPA also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs. The ALCO Policy minimum guideline level for salable unpledged government and agency securities is 3.0%. 

The following table presents certain information relating to FNBPA's credit availability and salable unpledged securities:

##TABLE_END

Unused wholesale credit availability increased $1.5 billion due to additional collateral capacity provided by loan growth and reduced usage provided by deposit growth. Salable unpledged government and agency securities decreased $636.0 million primarily due to an increase in relationship deposits requiring collateralization. 

Another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis. The following liquidity gap analysis as of December 31, 2019 compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over future time intervals. Management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business. A reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis. The twelve-month cumulative gap to total assets ratio was (0.3)% and (7.1)% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by ALCO.

In addition, the ALCO regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position. The stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions. Management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit-taking activities as a financial intermediary. To succeed in this capacity, we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers. These products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product behaviors do not complement one another. For example, depositors may want short-term deposits, while borrowers may desire long-term loans. 

Changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments, cash flows and net interest income. Subject to its ongoing oversight, the Board of Directors has given ALCO the responsibility for market risk management, which involves devising policy guidelines, risk measures and limits, and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. We use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. 

Interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios. Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indexes, which do not always change by the same amount. Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered. Options risk arises from &#8220;embedded options&#8221; within asset and liability products. For example, certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans, which may be with or without penalty, when rates fall, while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early, which may be with or without penalty, when rates rise. 

We use an asset/liability model to measure our interest rate risk. Interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation, EVE and gap analysis. Gap analysis and EVE are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business. Gap analysis, while a helpful diagnostic tool, displays cash flows for only a single rate environment. EVE&#8217;s long-term horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longer-term positions. However, EVE&#8217;s liquidation perspective does not translate into the earnings-based measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern. Net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest. In these simulations, our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios. The ALCO reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a regular basis. Reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile, which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies. 

The following repricing gap analysis as of December 31, 2019 compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time. Management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and EVE risk measures.

##TABLE_END

The twelve-month cumulative repricing gap to total assets was 7.0% and 3.2% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interest-bearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months. If interest rates increase as modeled, net interest income will increase and, conversely, if interest rates decrease as modeled, net interest income will decrease. The change in the cumulative repricing gap at December 31, 2019 , compared to December 31, 2018 , is primarily related to growth and changes in the mix of loans, deposits and borrowings. Strong commercial and industrial loan growth, a portion of which was swapped to adjustable rates, the sale of long-term fixed rate mortgage loans, and the increased cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios, were partially offset by growth in and repricing of interest-bearing non-maturity deposit balances and the funding of long-term FHLB advances. The funding of both fixed and adjustable longer-term borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth. 

The allocation of non-maturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the one-month maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates. For example, if a product&#8217;s rate is estimated to increase by 50% as much as the market rates, then 50% of the account balance was placed in this category. 

Utilizing net interest income simulations, the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion. The variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and EVE calculated under the particular rate scenario versus the net interest income and EVE that was calculated assuming market rates as of December 31, 2019 . Using a static Balance Sheet structure, the measures do not reflect all of management's potential counteractions. 

The following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and EVE to changes in interest rates using rate shocks:

We also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months (Rate Ramps) and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve. Assuming a static Balance Sheet, a +100 basis point Rate Ramp increases net interest income (12 months) by 1.5% and 1.0% at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The corresponding metrics for a -100 basis point Rate Ramp are (2.0)% and (1.6)% at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Our strategy is generally to manage to a neutral interest rate risk position. Consistent with prior years, we desired to remain slightly asset-sensitive during 2019. There are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact Net Interest Income. These include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates, as well as internal factors regarding product offerings, product mix and pricing of loans and deposits. At year-end 2018, the market consensus was expecting the FOMC to increase interest rates due to a strengthening economy. However, citing a softening economy, the FOMC actually moved to lower rates twice during the third quarter and once in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk (IRR) position. In response to the change in interest rates, management was proactive in addressing our IRR position. As mentioned earlier, we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest rate-sensitive than short-term time deposits and wholesale borrowings. Also, we were able to lower rates on certain deposit products and shorten the term of the certificates of deposit. This continues to be the focus of management. On the lending side, we regularly sell long-term fixed-rate residential mortgages to the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with short-term repricing characteristics. In particular, we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers (commercial swaps) to manage our IRR position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustable-rate loans. Total variable and adjustable-rate loans were 59.1% and 57.4% of total loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , 78.8% of these loans, or 46.5% of total loans, are tied to the Prime or one-month LIBOR rates. As of December 31, 2019 , the commercial swaps totaled $3.6 billion of notional principal, with $1.2 billion in notional swap principal originated during 2019 . For additional information regarding interest rate swaps, see Note 14, &#8220;Derivative and Hedging Activities&#8221; to the financial statements in this Report. The investment portfolio is also used, in part, to manage our IRR position. These purchases are fixed rate in nature in which we seek to minimize prepayment risk. 

We recognize that all asset/liability models have some inherent shortcomings. Asset/liability models require certain assumptions to be made, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and repricing impact on non-maturity deposits, which may differ from actual experience. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans, economic and market trends and available industry data. While management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable, there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved. Furthermore, the metrics are based upon the Balance Sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

As a financial institution, we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision, transaction and activity. Our Board of Directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk and strategic risk. In its oversight role of our risk management function, the Board of Directors focuses on the strategies, analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying, understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total stockholder value, while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations. 

The Board of Directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns. As such, the board monitors a series of Key Risk Indicators, for various business lines, operational units, and risk categories, providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite. These results are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement, and where appropriate, adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks. 

We support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our Board of Directors and senior management. The joint Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the FNBPA Board of Directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances. The Risk Committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

identification, measurement, assessment and monitoring of enterprise-wide risk; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory and operating risk (including technology, operational, compliance and fiduciary risks); and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

identification and implementation of risk management best practices. 

##TABLE_END The Risk Committee serves as the primary point of contact between our Board of Directors and the Risk Management Council, which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management. Risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our Board Risk Committee and Risk Management Council. We use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance tactics, while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Our top-down risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risk-taking for bottom-up planning from our various business functions. Our Board Risk Committee, in collaboration with our Risk Management Council, approves our risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently, as needed to reflect changes in the risk, regulatory, economic and strategic plan environments, with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations, regulatory environment and our shareholders' expectations. Reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans, and our ongoing monitoring thereof, are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our Board Risk Committee. 

As noted above, we have a Risk Management Council comprised of senior management. The purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. Management has also established an Operational Risk Committee that is responsible for identifying, evaluating and monitoring operational risks across FNB, evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the Risk Management Council. The Risk Management Council reports on a regular basis to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors regarding our enterprise-wide risk profile and other significant risk management issues. Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas, including the following departments: Enterprise-Wide Risk Management, Fraud Risk, Loan Review, Model Risk Management, Third-Party Risk Management, Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act, CRA, Appraisal Review, Compliance and Information and Cyber Security. All second line of defense departments report to the Chief Risk Officer to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a day-to-day basis. 

Our Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Department monitors the following risk and control assessments across various business and operational areas to ensure the appropriate risk identification, risk management and reporting of risks:

##TABLE_END

The table above shows how operating net income available to common stockholders (non-GAAP) is derived from amounts reported in our financial statements. We believe certain charges such as merger expenses, branch consolidation costs, service charge refunds and special one-time employee 401(k) contributions related to tax reform are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. The merger expenses and branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. Similarly, gains derived from the sale of a business are not organic to our operations.
