 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Management on F.N.B. Corporation&#8217;s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

February 27, 2020 

F.N.B. Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process effected by the Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. An entity&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Ernst &#38; Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as stated in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

F.N.B. Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of F.N.B. Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Description of the Matter 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s net loan and lease portfolio was $23.1 billion with an associated allowance for credit losses (ALLL) of $196 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the ALLL is based on management&#8217;s evaluation of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio, which includes an assessment of past loss experience, current economic conditions, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, the estimated value of underlying collateral and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The ALLL may also be adjusted for management&#8217;s assessment of qualitative factors, including among others: changes to lending policies; the experience and depth of lending management and staff; concentrations of credit; competition, legal and regulatory risk; national and local economic trends; or the historical imprecision of the model to estimate losses. 

Auditing the ALLL involves a high degree of subjectivity due to the qualitative factor adjustments included in the ALLL. Management&#8217;s identification and measurement of the qualitative factor adjustments is highly judgmental and could have a significant effect on the ALLL. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

&#160; 

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s controls over the ALLL process, which include, among others, management&#8217;s review and approval controls designed to assess the need for and level of qualitative factor adjustments to the ALLL and the reliability of the data utilized to support management&#8217;s assessment. 

To test the qualitative factor adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management&#8217;s methodology and assessed the basis for the adjustments and whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALLL. Regarding the measurement of the qualitative factors, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying internal and external market data utilized in management&#8217;s estimate and considered the existence of new or contrary information; for example, we compared economic data used in management&#8217;s determination of national and local economic trends with third party macro-economic reports. We evaluated the overall ALLL, inclusive of the qualitative factor adjustments, and whether the amount appropriately reflects losses incurred in the loan portfolio by comparing the overall ALLL to those established by peer banking institutions.

F.N.B. Corporation 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited F.N.B. Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, F.N.B. Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on F.N.B. Corporation&#8217;s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

F.N.B. CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The terms &#8220;FNB,&#8221; &#8220;the Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; throughout this Report mean F.N.B. Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates that we refer only to the parent company, F.N.B. Corporation. When we refer to "FNBPA" in this Report, we mean our bank subsidiary, First National Bank of Pennsylvania, and its subsidiaries. 

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

F.N.B. Corporation, headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a diversified financial services company operating in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. As of December 31, 2019 , we had 369 banking offices throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. 

We provide a full range of commercial banking, consumer banking, and wealth management solutions through our subsidiary network which is led by our largest affiliate, FNBPA, founded in 1864. Commercial banking solutions include corporate banking, small business banking, investment real estate financing, government banking, business credit, capital markets and lease financing. Consumer banking provides a full line of consumer banking products and services including deposit products, mortgage lending, consumer lending and a complete suite of mobile and online banking services. Wealth management services include asset management, private banking and insurance. 

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

Our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. We own and operate FNBPA, FNTC, First National Investment Services Company, LLC, FNBIA, FNIA, Bank Capital Services, LLC, and F.N.B. Capital Corporation, LLC, and include results for each of these entities in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Companies in which we hold more than a 50% voting equity interest, or a controlling financial interest, or are a variable interest entity (VIE) in which we have the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant to the VIE are consolidated. VIEs in which we do not hold the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance or does not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant to the VIE are not consolidated. Investments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when we have the ability to exert significant influence. Investments in private investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are included in other assets and our proportional interest in the equity investments&#8217; earnings are included in other non-interest income. Investment interests accounted for under the cost and equity methods are periodically evaluated for impairment. 

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments that are necessary, in the opinion of management, to fairly reflect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with GAAP. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on our net income and stockholders&#8217; equity. Events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2019 have been evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the filing of the Consolidated Financial Statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Use of Estimates 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes include the allowance for credit losses, accounting for loans acquired in a business combination, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and other intangible assets, litigation, income taxes and deferred tax assets. 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

We earn certain revenues from contracts with customers. These revenues are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to the customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in an exchange for those services. 

In determining the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts with customers, we consider whether the contract has commercial substance and is approved by both parties with identifiable contractual rights, payment terms, and the collectability of consideration is probable. Generally, we satisfy our performance obligations upon the completion of services at the amount to which we have the right to invoice or charge under contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. We apply this guidance on a portfolio basis to contracts with similar characteristics and for which we believe the results would not differ materially from applying this guidance to individual contracts. 

Our services provided under contracts with customers are transferred at the point in time when the services are rendered. Generally, we do not defer incremental direct costs to obtain contracts with customers that would be amortized in one year or less under the practical expedient. These costs are recognized as expense, primarily salary and benefit expense, in the period incurred. 

Deposit Services . We recognize revenue on deposit services based on published fees for services provided. Demand and savings deposit customers have the right to cancel their depository arrangements and withdraw their deposited funds at any time without prior notice. When services involve deposited funds that can be retrieved by customers without penalties, we consider the service contract term to be day-to-day, where each day represents the renewal of the contract. The contract does not extend beyond the services performed and revenue is recognized at the end of the contract term (daily) as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

No deposit services fees exist for long-term deposit products beyond early withdrawal penalties, which are earned on these products at the time of early termination. 

Revenue from deposit services fees are reduced where we have a history of waived or reduced fees by customer request or due to a customer service issue, by historical experience, or another acceptable method in the same period as the related revenues. Revenues from deposit services are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income as service charges and in the Community Banking segment as non-interest income. 

Wealth Management Services. Wealth advisory and trust services are provided on a month-to-month basis and invoiced as services are rendered. Fees are based on a fixed amount or a scale based on the level of services provided or assets under management. The customer has the right to terminate their services agreement at any time. We determine the value of services performed based on the fee schedule in effect at the time the services are performed. Revenues from wealth advisory and trust services are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income as trust services and securities commissions and fees, and in the Wealth segment as non-interest income. 

Insurance Services. Insurance services include full-service insurance brokerage services offering numerous lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers to businesses and individuals within our geographic markets. We recognize revenue on insurance contracts in effect based on contractually specified commission payments on premiums that are paid by the customer to the insurance carrier. Contracts are cancellable at any time and we have no performance obligation to the customers beyond the time the insurance is placed into effect. Revenues from insurance services are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income as insurance commissions and fees, and in the Insurance segment as non-interest income. 

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method . Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values as of that date, and are recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in transit and amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank and other depository institutions (including interest-bearing deposits). 

Debt Securities 

Debt securities comprise a significant portion of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such securities can be classified as trading, HTM or AFS. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we did not hold any trading debt securities. 

Debt securities HTM are the securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold until their maturity. Such securities are carried at cost, adjusted for related amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts through interest income from securities, and subject to evaluation for OTTI. 

Debt securities that are not classified as trading or HTM are classified as AFS. Such securities are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses deemed to be temporary and OTTI attributable to non-credit factors reported separately as a component of OCI, net of tax. 

We evaluate our debt securities in a loss position for OTTI on a quarterly basis at the individual security level based on our intent to sell. 

If we intend to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI must be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments&#8217; amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI must be separated into the amount representing credit loss and the amount related to all other market factors. The amount related to credit loss will be recognized in earnings. The amount related to other market factors will be recognized in OCI, net of tax. 

We perform our OTTI evaluation process in a consistent and systematic manner and include an evaluation of all available evidence. This process considers factors such as length of time and anticipated recovery period of the impairment, recent events specific to the issuer and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. Securities, generally U.S. government and federal agency securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. The fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third party is continually monitored and additional collateral is obtained or is requested to be returned to us as deemed appropriate. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

From time to time, we may enter into derivative transactions principally to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and liabilities and on future cash flows. Foreign exchange derivatives are entered into to accommodate the needs of customers. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability. Accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative is dependent upon whether it has been designated in a formal, qualifying hedging relationship. For derivatives in qualifying hedging relationships, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the items hedged. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU 2017-12 which provides targeted improvements to the hedge accounting model that more closely aligns the accounting and reporting for hedging relationships with risk management activities. In addition, ASU 2017-12 provides administrative relief by easing documentation requirements, simplifying the application of hedge accounting by expanding the application of the shortcut method, eliminating the separate measurement and reporting of hedge ineffectiveness and generally requiring the entire effect of the hedging instrument and the hedged item to be presented in the same income statement line item. We believe these changes will provide users with more useful information about the effect of our risk management activities on the financial statements. 

Changes in fair value of a derivative instrument that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including any ineffectiveness, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the consolidated statements of income in the same line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item in the period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Prior to 2019, the ineffective portion, if any, was reported in earnings immediately. 

At the hedge&#8217;s inception, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future. At each reporting period thereafter, a statistical regression or qualitative analysis is performed to evaluate hedge effectiveness. If it is determined a derivative instrument has not been or will not continue to be highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. 

We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to meet the interest rate risk management needs of qualifying commercial loan customers. These agreements provide the customer the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. We then enter into positions with a derivative counterparty in order to offset our exposure on the fixed components of the customer agreements. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies and monitoring. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into transactions with only high-quality institutions and using collateral agreements and other contract provisions. These arrangements meet the definition of derivatives, but are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships. The interest rate swap agreement with the loan customer and with the counterparty are reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings as other income. 

Loans Held for Sale and Loan Commitments 

Certain of our residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased for sale in the secondary mortgage loan market. We make an automatic election to account for all originated or purchased residential mortgage loans held for sale under the FVO. The FVO election is intended to better reflect the underlying economics and better facilitate the economic hedging of the loans. The FVO is applied on an instrument by instrument basis and is an irrevocable election. Additionally, with the election of the FVO, fees and costs associated with the origination and acquisition of residential mortgage loans held for sale are expensed as incurred, rather than deferred. Changes in fair value under the FVO are recorded in mortgage banking operations non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income. Fair value is determined on the basis of rates obtained in the respective secondary market for the type of loan held for sale. Gain or loss on the sale of loans is recorded in mortgage banking operations non-interest income. Interest income on loans held for sale is recorded in interest income. 

We routinely issue interest rate lock commitments for residential mortgage loans that we intend to sell. These interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives. We also enter into loan sale commitments to sell these loans when funded to mitigate the risk that the market value of residential mortgage loans may decline between the time the rate commitment is issued to the customer and the time we sell the loan. These loan sale commitments are also derivatives. Both types of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking operations non-interest income. 

We also originate loans guaranteed by the SBA for the purchase of businesses, business startups, business expansion, equipment, and working capital. All SBA loans are underwritten and documented as prescribed by the SBA. SBA loans originated with the intention to sell on the secondary market are classified as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. At the time of the sale, we allocate the carrying value of the entire loan between the guaranteed portion sold and the unguaranteed portion retained based on their relative fair value which results in a discount recorded on the retained portion of the loan. The guaranteed portion is typically sold at a premium and the gain is recognized in other income for any net premium received in excess of the relative fair value of the portion of the loan transferred. The net carrying value of the retained portion of the loans is included in the appropriate commercial loan classification for disclosure purposes. 

Loans (Excluding Loans Acquired in a Business Combination) 

Loans we intend to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances, net of any unearned income, deferred origination fees or costs, or premium or discounts on purchased loans. Interest income on loans is computed over the term of the loans using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees or costs and premiums or discounts are deferred and amortized over the term of the loan or loan commitment period as an adjustment to the related loan yield. 

Non-performing Loans 

Interest is not accrued on loans where collectability is uncertain. We discontinue interest accruals on loans generally when principal or interest is due and has remained unpaid for a certain number of days unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans are placed on non-accrual at 90 days, installment loans are placed on non-accrual at 120 days and residential mortgages and consumer lines of credit are generally placed on non-accrual at 180 days. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. 

When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid interest is reversed against interest income and the amortization of deferred fees and costs is suspended. Payments subsequently received are generally applied to either principal or interest or both, depending on management&#8217;s evaluation of collectability. A loan is returned to accrual status when principal and interest are no longer past due and collectability is probable. This generally requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments. 

Loans are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectible or when they reach a predetermined number of days past due depending upon loan product, terms, and other factors. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance for credit losses. 

We consider a loan impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. The impairment loss is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the loan&#8217;s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, if the loan is collateral dependent. Purchased credit impaired loans are not classified as non-performing assets as the loans are considered to be performing. 

Restructured loans are those in which concessions of terms have been made as a result of deterioration in a borrower&#8217;s financial condition. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a TDR if we for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider under current market conditions. Debt restructurings or loan modifications for a borrower occur in the normal course of business and do not necessarily constitute TDRs. To designate a loan as a TDR, the presence of both borrower financial distress and a concession of terms must exist. Additionally, a loan designated as a TDR does not necessarily result in the automatic placement of the loan on non-accrual status. When the full collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured on a loan designated as a TDR and the borrower does not otherwise meet the criteria for non-accrual status, we will continue to accrue interest on the loan. A restructured acquired loan that is accounted for as a component of a pool is not considered a TDR. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Allowances for impaired commercial loans over $ 1.0 million are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. All other impaired loans are evaluated in the aggregate based on loan segment loss given default. Changes in the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for credit losses. 

The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level that, in management&#8217;s judgment, is believed appropriate to absorb probable losses associated with specifically identified loans, as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. The appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is based on management&#8217;s evaluation of potential loan losses in the loan portfolio, which includes an assessment of past experience, current economic conditions in specific industries and geographic areas, general economic conditions, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, the estimated value of underlying collateral and residuals and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. Determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on transition matrices with predefined loss emergence and lookback periods, and consideration of qualitative factors, all of which are susceptible to significant change. 

Loans Acquired in a Business Combination 

Loans acquired in a business combination (impaired and non-impaired) are initially recorded at their acquisition-date fair values. Fair values are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, default rates, loss severity, collateral values, discount rates, payment speeds, prepayment risk, and liquidity risk. 

The carryover of allowance for credit losses related to loans acquired in a business combination is prohibited as any credit losses in the loans are included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date. The allowance for credit losses on loans acquired in a business combination reflects only those losses incurred after acquisition and represents the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition that is no longer expected to be collected. 

At acquisition, we consider the following factors as indicators that an acquired loan has evidence of deterioration in credit quality and is therefore impaired and in the scope of ASC 310-30: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

loans that were 90 days or more past due; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

loans that had an internal risk rating of substandard or worse. Substandard is consistent with regulatory definitions and is defined as having a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes liquidation of the loan; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

loans that were classified as non-accrual by the acquired bank at the time of acquisition; or 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

loans that had been previously modified in a TDR. 

##TABLE_END Any loans acquired in a business combination that were not individually in the scope of ASC 310-30 because they didn&#8217;t meet the criteria above were pooled into groups of similar loans based on various factors including borrower type, loan purpose, and collateral type. For these pools, we used certain loan information, including outstanding principal balance, estimated expected losses, weighted average maturity, weighted average margin, and weighted average interest rate along with estimated prepayment rates, probability of default and loss given default to estimate the expected cash flow for each loan pool. We believe analogizing to ASC 310-30 is the more appropriate option to follow in accounting for discount accretion on non-impaired loans acquired in a business combination other than revolving loans and therefore account for such loans in accordance with ASC 310-30. ASC 310-30 guidance does not apply to revolving loans. Consequently, discount accretion on revolving loans acquired is accounted for using the ASC 310-20 approach. 

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition over recorded fair value is referred to as the accretable yield. The accretable yield is recognized into income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, using an effective yield method, if the timing and/or amount of cash flows expected to be collected can be reasonably estimated (the accretion model). The difference between the loan&#8217;s total scheduled principal and interest payments over all cash flows expected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. The non-accretable difference represents contractually required principal and interest payments which we do not expect to collect. 

Over the life of the acquired loan, we continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected. Decreases in expected cash flows, other than from prepayments or rate adjustments, are recognized as impairments through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent improvements in cash flows result in first, reversal of existing valuation allowances recognized subsequent to acquisition, if any, and next, an increase in the amount of accretable yield to be subsequently recognized on a prospective basis over the loan&#8217;s remaining life. 

Loans acquired in a business combination that met the criteria for non-accrual of interest prior to acquisition are considered performing upon acquisition, regardless of whether the customer is contractually delinquent, if we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of expected cash flows on such loans. Accordingly, we do not consider contractually delinquent purchased credit impaired loans to be non-accrual or non-performing and continue to recognize interest income on these loans using the accretion model. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are expensed over the lesser of the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life or the term of the lease including renewal periods when reasonably assured. Useful lives are dependent upon the nature and condition of the asset and range from 3 to 39 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while major improvements are capitalized and amortized to expense over the identified useful life. 

Premises and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

Cloud Computing Arrangements 

W e evaluate fees paid for cloud computing arrangements to determine if those arrangements include the purchase of or license to use software that should be accounted for separately as internal-use software. If a contract includes the purchase or license to use software that should be accounted for separately as internal-use software, the contract is amortized over the software&#8217;s identified useful life in amortization of intangibles. For contracts that do not include a software license, the contract is accounted for as a service contract with fees paid recorded in other non-interest expense. 

In the third quarter of 2018, we early adopted, on a prospective basis, ASU 2018-15 which allows for implementation costs for activities performed in cloud computing arrangements that are a service contract to be accounted for under the internal-use software guidance which allows for certain implementation costs to be capitalized depending on the nature of the costs and the project stage. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-15 all implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements that were a service contract were expensed as incurred. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

OREO is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. OREO acquired in settlement of indebtedness is included in other assets initially at the lower of estimated fair value of the asset less estimated selling costs or the carrying amount of the loan. Changes to the value subsequent to transfer are recorded in non-interest expense along with direct operating expenses. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from sales of OREO are recognized in non-interest income on the date of sale. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles and renewal lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing. Core deposit intangibles are primarily amortized over ten years using accelerated methods. Customer renewal lists are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from eight to thirteen years . 

Goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which must be conducted at least annually. We perform impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts, as necessary. 

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the goodwill impairment test is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the market rate of return, projected growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables. However, future events could cause us to conclude that goodwill or other intangibles have become impaired, which would result in recording an impairment loss. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Loan Servicing Rights 

We have two primary classes of servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing and SBA-guaranteed loan servicing. We recognize the right to service residential mortgage loans and SBA-guaranteed loans for others as an asset whether we purchase the servicing rights or as a result from a sale of loans that we originated or purchased when the servicing is contractually separated from the underlying loan and retained by us. 

We initially record servicing rights at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequently, servicing rights are measured at the lower of cost or fair value. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income in mortgage banking operations non-interest income for residential mortgage loans and other non-interest income for SBA-guaranteed loans. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. 

MSRs are separated into pools based on common risk characteristics of the underlying loans and evaluated for impairment at least quarterly. SBA-guaranteed servicing rights are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly on an aggregate basis. 

Impairment, if any, is recognized when carrying value exceeds the fair value as determined by calculating the present value of expected net future cash flows. If impairment exists at the pool level for residential mortgage loans or on an aggregate basis for SBA-guaranteed loans, the servicing right is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage banking operations non-interest income or other non-interest income, respectively. 

Bank Owned Life Insurance 

We have purchased life insurance policies on certain current and former directors, officers and employees for which the Corporation is the owner and beneficiary. These policies are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their cash surrender value, or the amount that could be realized by surrendering the policies. Tax-exempt income from death benefits and changes in the net cash surrender value are recorded in bank owned life insurance non-interest income. 

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

We invest in various affordable housing projects that qualify for LIHTCs. The net investments are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments generate a return through the realization of federal tax credits. We use the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of our investments in these entities. LIHTCs that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are recognized using the equity method. Our net investment in LIHTCs was $ 59.6 million and $ 43.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our unfunded commitments in LIHTCs were $ 60.1 million and $ 57.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Leases 

We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception of the contract. As a lessee, we consider a contract to be, or contain, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. We recognize in our Consolidated Balance Sheets the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For an operating lease, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment, and other liabilities. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, instead we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases that commenced before January 1, 2019, we have applied the modified retrospective transition method which resulted in comparative information not being restated. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#8216;package of practical expedients&#8217;, which permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. 

Right-of-use assets and liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets are adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement, lease incentives, and accrued rent. If the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, we discount the lease using our incremental borrowing rate which is derived by reference to FNB's secured borrowing rate. Our leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such an option, the lease term includes those periods. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method. Certain of our lease agreements include variable rental payments based on a percentage of transactions and others include variable rental payments that periodically adjust to rates and charges stated in the agreements. Variable costs, such as maintenance expenses, property taxes, property insurance, transaction-based lease payments and index-based rate increases, are expensed as incurred. Right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For operating leases, if deemed impaired, the right-of-use asset is written down and the remaining balance is subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis. 

We have real estate lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. 

As a lessor, when a lease meets certain criteria indicating that we effectively have transferred control of the underlying asset to the customer, the lease is classified as a sales-type lease. When a lease does not meet the criteria for a sales-type lease but meets the criteria of a direct financing lease, the lease is classified as a direct financing lease. When none of the required criteria for sales-type lease or direct-financing lease are met, the lease is classified as an operating lease. 

Both sales-type leases and direct financing leases are recognized as a net investment in the lease on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net investment comprises the lease receivable including any residual value of the underlying asset that is 

guaranteed by the customer or any other third party unrelated to us and the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying asset. Operating lease income is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. We do not evaluate whether sales taxes and similar taxes imposed by a governmental authority on lease transactions and collected by us are our primary obligation as owner of the underlying leased asset and exclude from lease income all taxes collected. 

Income Taxes 

We file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for federal and state income taxes is based on income reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements, rather than the amounts reported on the respective income tax returns. DTAs and DTLs are computed using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. The effect on DTAs and DTLs resulting from a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the change in tax rates is enacted. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, we made an accounting policy election to reclassify the stranded tax effects that relate to a change in the federal tax rate from AOCI to retained earnings in accordance with newly adopted accounting guidance. We believe this change in accounting policy reduces the cost and complexity of accounting for stranded tax effects due to a change in federal tax rates. 

We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 

We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our DTAs. If recovery is not likely, we will increase our valuation allowance against the DTAs that are unlikely to be recovered by recording a provision for income taxes. We believe that we will ultimately recover the DTAs recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

We periodically review the tax positions we take on our tax return and apply a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax positions that are uncertain. The amount recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. 

Marketing Costs 

Marketing costs are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing expense totaled $ 13.1 million , $ 12.8 million and $ 11.5 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

Per Share Amounts 

Earnings per common share is computed using net income available to common stockholders, which is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends. 

Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, net of unvested shares of restricted stock. 

Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, adjusted for the dilutive effect of potential common shares issuable for stock options, warrants and restricted shares, as calculated using the treasury stock method. Adjustments to net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments dilute earnings per common share. 

The assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing diluted earnings per share excludes the amount of excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in accumulated paid-in capital. 

Retirement Plans 

We sponsor retirement plans for our employees. The calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. The plans utilize assumptions and methods including reflecting trust assets at their fair value for the qualified pension plans and recognizing the overfunded and underfunded status of the 

plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses, prior service costs and credits are recognized in AOCI, net of tax, until they are amortized, or immediately upon curtailment. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

Our stock-based compensation awards require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, made to employees and stock awards made to directors. Generally, these restricted stock unit awards to employees vest over a three -year service period and the stock awards made to directors vest immediately. 

We are required to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. For time-based awards, the value of the award is recognized as expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the shorter of requisite service periods or the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire. 

Prior to 2018, we granted restricted stock unit awards that had market conditions. Compensation cost for awards with market-based performance targets is recognized based on the award&#8217;s grant date fair value. 

Beginning in 2018, we granted restricted stock unit awards with multiple-conditions, both performance and market conditions. These awards were accounted for by considering the market condition in the grant date fair value and recognizing compensation expense over the service period based on the grant date fair value and the probability that the performance condition will be met. 

We account for forfeitures as they occur.

&#160; 

These Updates &#160; require lessees to put most leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets but recognize expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income similar to current accounting. In addition, the Update changes the guidance for sales-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease executory costs for most entities. All entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease related revenue and expense. 

&#160; 

We adopted these Updates in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective transition method. In addition, the new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#8216;package of practical expedients,&#8217; which permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. 

Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of $116 million in right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $126 million for operating leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The standard did not materially impact our consolidated net earnings and had no impact on cash flows. 

These Updates were effective as of January 1, 2019.

ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 

&#160; 

These Updates replace the current long-standing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses (commonly referred to as CECL) for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including loans, HTM debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining life of the financial asset at the time the asset is originated or acquired, considering historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In addition, the Update will require the use of a modified AFS debt security impairment model and eliminate the current accounting for PCI loans and debt securities. 

&#160; 

These Updates are to be applied using a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. While these Updates change the measurement of the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL), it does not change the credit risk of our lending portfolios or the ultimate losses in those portfolios. However, the CECL ACL methodology will produce higher volatility in the quarterly provision for credit losses than our current reserve process. 

We created a cross-functional management steering group to govern implementation and the Audit and Risk Committees and the Board of Directors received regular updates. For loans measured at amortized cost we have implemented a new modeling platform and integrated other auxiliary models to support a calculation of expected credit losses under CECL. We have made decisions on segmentation, a reasonable and supportable forecast period, a reversion method and period and a historical loss forecast covering the remaining contractual life, adjusted for prepayments as well as other criteria necessary. 

Based on our portfolio composition and forecasts of relatively stable macroeconomic conditions over the next two years, we currently estimate that our CECL ACL on the originated portfolio will increase approximately 30%, primarily driven by our consumer portfolios. The overall ACL including the "gross-up" for PCI loans of approximately $50 million is approximately $300-$310 million. There is no capital impact related to the PCI loans at adoption. The impact for the adoption of CECL is a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $52 million. 

The impact of this Update is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality, as well as historical experience, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates at the time of adoption. 

The impact to our AFS and HTM debt securities is immaterial. 

Model development, as well as the development of policies and procedures and, internal controls are complete. 

This Update is effective as of January 1, 2020.

We do not intend to sell the debt securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment 

We evaluate our investment securities portfolio for OTTI on a quarterly basis. Impairment is assessed at the individual security level. We consider an investment security impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost basis. We did not recognize any OTTI losses on securities for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

States of the U.S. and Political Subdivisions 

Our municipal bond portfolio with a carrying amount of $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 is highly rated with an average rating of AA and 100 % of the portfolio rated A or better, while 99 % have stand-alone ratings of A or better. All of the securities in the municipal portfolio are general obligation bonds. Geographically, municipal bonds support our primary footprint as 66 % of the securities are from municipalities located in the primary states within which we conduct business. The average holding size of the securities in the municipal bond portfolio is $ 3.4 million . In addition to the strong stand-alone ratings, 63 % of the municipalities have some formal credit enhancement insurance that strengthens the creditworthiness of their issue. Management reviews the credit profile of each issuer on a quarterly basis.

We are a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh and the FRB of Cleveland. Both institutions require members to purchase and hold a specified minimum level of stock based upon their membership, level of borrowings, collateral balances or participation in other programs. The FHLB and FRB stock is restricted in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions. These non-marketable equity securities are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investments are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment periodically based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. We determined there was no impairment at December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Additionally, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had residential construction loans of $ 297.3 million and $ 273.4 million , representing 1.3 % and 1.2 % of total loans and leases, respectively. 

We have extended credit to certain directors and executive officers and their related interests. These related-party loans were made in the ordinary course of business under normal credit terms and do not involve more than a normal risk of collection. Following is a summary of the activity for these loans to related parties during 2019 :

Loans Acquired in a Business Combination 

All loans acquired in a business combination were initially recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Refer to the Loans Acquired in a Business Combination section in Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; for a discussion of ASC 310-20 and ASC 310-30 loans. The outstanding balance and the carrying amount of loans acquired in a business combination included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:

The outstanding balance is the undiscounted sum of all amounts owed under the loan, including amounts deemed principal, interest, fees, penalties and other, whether or not currently due and whether or not any such amounts have been charged-off. 

The carrying amount of PCI loans included in the table above totaled $ 1.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 1.7 million at December 31, 2018 , representing 0.05 % and 0.04 % , respectively, of the carrying amount of total loans acquired in a business combination as of each date. 

The following table provides changes in accretable yield for all loans acquired in business combinations that are accounted for under ASC 310-30. Loans accounted for under ASC 310-20 are not included in this table.

##TABLE_END

Cash flows expected to be collected on loans acquired in business combinations are estimated quarterly by incorporating several key assumptions similar to the initial estimate of fair value. These key assumptions include probability of default and the amount of actual prepayments after the acquisition date. Prepayments affect the estimated life of the loans and could change the amount of interest income. In reforecasting future estimated cash flows, credit loss expectations are adjusted as necessary. Improved cash flow expectations for loans or pools are recorded first as a reversal of previously recorded impairment, if any, and then as an increase in prospective yield when all previously recorded impairment has been recaptured. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a charge to the provision for credit losses and credit to the allowance for credit losses. 

During 2019 , there was an overall improvement in cash flow expectations which resulted in a net reclassification of $ 97.0 million from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield primarily driven by overall improvement in the primary credit quality indicators of the majority of the acquired loan pools. This reclassification was $ 266.5 million for 2018 . The reclassification from the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield results in prospective yield adjustments on the loan pools. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Credit Quality 

Management monitors the credit quality of our loan portfolio using several performance measures based on payment activity and borrower performance. 

Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and non-performing TDRs. We place loans on non-accrual status and discontinue interest accruals on loans generally when principal or interest is due and has remained unpaid for a certain number of days, or when the full amount of principal and interest is due and has remained unpaid for a certain number of days, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans and leases are placed on non-accrual at 90 days, installment loans are placed on non-accrual at 120 days and residential mortgages and consumer lines of credit are placed on non-accrual at 180 days, though we may place a loan on non-accrual prior to these past due thresholds as warranted. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Non-accrual loans may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest have been paid and the ultimate ability to collect the remaining principal and interest is reasonably assured. The majority of TDRs are loans in which we have granted a concession on the original repayment terms due to the borrower&#8217;s financial distress. 

Following is a summary of non-performing assets:

The carrying value of residential-secured consumer OREO held as a result of obtaining physical possession upon completion of a foreclosure or through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure amounted to $ 3.3 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 6.3 million at December 31, 2018 . The recorded investment of residential-secured consumer OREO for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 totaled $ 9.2 million and $ 8.9 million , respectively.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Past due information for loans acquired in a business combination is based on the contractual balance outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Loans acquired in a business combination are considered performing upon acquisition, regardless of whether the customer is contractually delinquent, if we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of expected cash flows on such loans. In these instances, we do not consider acquired contractually delinquent loans to be non-accrual or non-performing and continue to recognize interest income on these loans using the accretion method. Loans acquired in a business combination are considered non-accrual or non-performing when, due to credit deterioration or other factors, we determine we are no longer able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of expected cash flows on such loans. We do not recognize interest income on loans acquired in a business combination considered non-accrual or non-performing.

##TABLE_END

The use of these internally assigned credit quality categories within the commercial loan and lease portfolio permits management&#8217;s use of transition matrices to estimate a quantitative portion of credit risk. Our internal credit risk grading system is based on past experiences with similarly graded loans and leases and conforms with regulatory categories. In general, loan and lease risk ratings within each category are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to our policy for each class of loans and leases. Each quarter, management analyzes the resulting ratings, as well as other external statistics and factors such as delinquency, to track the migration performance of the commercial loan and lease portfolio. Loans and leases within the Pass credit category or that migrate toward the Pass credit category generally have a lower risk of loss compared to loans and leases that migrate toward the Substandard or Doubtful credit categories. Accordingly, management applies higher risk factors to Substandard and Doubtful credit categories. 

The following tables present a summary of our commercial loans and leases by credit quality category segregated by loans and leases originated and loans acquired:

##TABLE_END

Credit quality information for loans acquired in a business combination is based on the contractual balance outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

We use delinquency transition matrices within the consumer and other loan classes to enable management to estimate a quantitative portion of credit risk. Each month, management analyzes payment and volume activity, FICO scores and other external factors such as unemployment, to determine how consumer loans are performing.

##TABLE_END

Loans are designated as impaired when, in the opinion of management, based on current information and events, the collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan and lease contract is doubtful. Typically, we do not consider loans for impairment unless a sustained period of delinquency (i.e., 90 -plus days) is noted or there are subsequent events that impact repayment probability (i.e., negative financial trends, bankruptcy filings, imminent foreclosure proceedings, etc.). Impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for consumer installment loans, residential mortgages, consumer lines of credit and commercial loan relationships less than $ 1.0 million based on loan segment loss given default. For commercial loan relationships greater than or equal to $ 1.0 million , a specific valuation allowance is allocated, if necessary, so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using a market interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Consistent with our existing method of income recognition for loans, interest income on impaired loans, except those classified as non-accrual, is recognized using the accrual method. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. 

Following is a summary of information pertaining to loans and leases considered to be impaired, by class of loan and lease:

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs typically result from loss mitigation activities and could include the extension of a maturity date, interest rate reduction, principal forgiveness, deferral or decrease in payments for a period of time and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. 

Following is a summary of the composition of total TDRs:

TDRs that are accruing and performing include loans that met the criteria for non-accrual of interest prior to restructuring for which we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of the expected cash flows on such loans and for which we expect to fully collect the new carrying value of the loans. During 2019 , we returned to performing status $ 4.4 million in restructured residential mortgage loans that have consistently met their modified obligations for more than six months. TDRs that are accruing and non-performing are comprised of consumer loans that have not demonstrated a consistent repayment pattern on the modified terms for more than six months, however it is expected that we will collect all future principal and interest payments. TDRs that are on non-accrual are not placed on accruing status until all delinquent principal and interest have been paid and the ultimate collectability of the remaining principal and interest is reasonably assured. Some loan modifications 

classified as TDRs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest, as modified, and may result in potential incremental losses which are factored into the allowance for credit losses. 

Excluding purchased credit impaired loans, commercial loans over $ 1.0 million whose terms have been modified in a TDR are generally placed on non-accrual, individually analyzed and measured for estimated impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Our allowance for credit losses included specific reserves for commercial TDRs and pooled reserves for individually impaired loans under $ 1.0 million based on loan segment loss given default. Our allowance for loan losses includes specific reserves for commercial TDRs of less than $0.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and pooled reserves for individual loans of $ 0.8 million and $ 0.5 million for those same respective periods, based on loan segment loss given default. Upon default, the amount of the recorded investment in the TDR in excess of the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, is generally considered a confirmed loss and is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

All other classes of loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR are pooled and measured for estimated impairment based on the expected net present value of the estimated future cash flows of the pool. Our allowance for credit losses included pooled reserves for these classes of loans of $ 4.1 million and $ 4.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Upon default of an individual loan, our charge-off policy is followed for that class of loan.

##TABLE_END

The fair value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset&#8217;s future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third-party valuations. Changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of MSRs. Generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of MSRs and as interest rates increase, mortgage loan prepayments decline, which results in an increase in the fair value of MSRs. Measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time. 

Following is a summary of the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs to changes in key assumptions: &#160;

##TABLE_END

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumptions, while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changing another, which may magnify or contract the effect of the change. We had a $ 1.5 million valuation allowance for MSRs as of December 31, 2019 , compared to $ 0.5 million at December 31, 2018 . 

SBA-Guaranteed Loan Servicing 

We retain the servicing rights on SBA-guaranteed loans sold to investors. The standard sale structure under the SBA Secondary Participation Guaranty Agreement provides for us to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the SBA guaranteed portion of the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. The unpaid principal balance of SBA-guaranteed loans serviced for investors, as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , was as follows:

The fair value of the SBA servicing rights is compared to the amortized basis. If the amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against other non-interest income. We had a $ 1.2 million valuation allowance for SBA servicing rights as of December 31, 2019 , compared to $ 0.8 million at December 31, 2018 .

(1) Other represents Consumer Finance which was a reportable segment prior to December 31, 2018. The deduction of goodwill for the Consumer Finance segment in 2018 was the result of the sale of Regency to Mariner Finance, LLC on August 31, 2018, as part of our strategy to enhance the overall positioning of our consumer banking operations. 

The addition of goodwill for the Insurance segment in 2018 and 2019 was the result of the FNIA acquisitions of a Maryland-based insurance agency on December 17, 2018 and a North Carolina-based insurance agency on June 17, 2019. We recorded goodwill in the Community Banking segment during 2018 as a result of the purchase accounting adjustments relating to the YDKN acquisition described in Note 27, &#8220;Mergers and Acquisitions.&#8221;

Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We completed this test in 2019 and 2018 and determined that our intangible assets are not impaired. 

NOTE 10. OPERATING LEASES 

We have operating leases primarily for certain branches, office space, land, and office equipment. Our operating leases expire at various dates through the year 2046 and generally include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. As of December 31, 2019 , we had operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $ 121.4 million and $ 128.2 million , respectively. 

Our operating lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 

As of December 31, 2019 , we have certain operating lease agreements, primarily for administrative office space, that have not yet commenced. At commencement, it is expected that these leases will add approximately $ 29.0 million in right-of-use assets and other liabilities. These operating leases will commence in 2020 with lease terms of 6 years to 15 years.

Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are comprised of customer repurchase agreements, which are sweep accounts with next-day maturities utilized by larger commercial customers to earn interest on their funds. Securities are pledged to these customers in an amount at least equal to the outstanding balance. Of the total short-term FHLB advances, there were no overnight maturities as of December 31, 2019 . Of the total short-term FHLB advances as of December 31, 2018 , 57.2 % had overnight maturities. At December 31, 2019 , $ 1.5 billion , or 64.5 % , of the short-term FHLB advances were swapped to a fixed rate with maturities in 2020. This compares to $ 1.0 billion , or 42.8 % , as of December 31, 2018 .

Federal Home Loan Bank advances 

Our banking affiliate has available credit with the FHLB of $ 7.9 billion , of which $ 3.2 billion was utilized as of December 31, 2019 . These advances are secured by loans collateralized by residential mortgages, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate and FHLB stock and are scheduled to mature in various amounts periodically through the year 2022 . Effective interest rates paid on the long-term advances ranged from 1.62 % to 2.71 % for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 1.39 % to 4.19 % for the year ended December 31, 2018 . 

Subordinated notes 

Subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated to our other indebtedness. The subordinated notes mature in various amounts periodically through the year 2029. At December 31, 2019 , all of the subordinated notes are redeemable by the holders prior to maturity at a discount equal to three to 12 months of interest, depending on the term of the note. We may require the holder to give 30 days prior written notice. No sinking fund is required and none has been established to retire the notes.

Junior subordinated debt 

The junior subordinated debt is comprised of the debt securities issued by FNB in relation to our three unconsolidated subsidiary trusts (collectively, the Trusts), which are unconsolidated variable interest entities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in long-term borrowings. One hundred percent of the common equity of each Trust is owned by FNB. The Trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing FNB-obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities, or TPS to third-party investors. The proceeds from the sale of TPS and the issuance of common equity by the Trusts were invested in junior subordinated debt securities issued by FNB, which are the sole assets of each Trust. Since third-party investors are the primary beneficiaries, the Trusts are not consolidated in our Financial Statements. The Trusts pay dividends on the TPS at the same rate as the distributions paid by us on the junior subordinated debt held by the Trusts. F.N.B. Statutory Trust II was formed by us, and the other two statutory trusts were assumed through acquisitions. The acquired statutory trusts were adjusted to fair value in conjunction with the various acquisitions. 

We record the distributions on the junior subordinated debt issued to the Trusts as interest expense. The TPS are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debt. The TPS are eligible for redemption, at any time, at our discretion. Under capital guidelines, the junior subordinated debt, net of our investments in the Trusts, is included in tier 2 capital. We have entered into agreements which, when taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee the obligations under the TPS subject to the terms of each of the guarantees.

NOTE 14. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate risk, primarily by managing the amount, source, and duration of our assets and liabilities, and through the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income and cash flows. We also use derivative instruments to facilitate transactions on behalf of our customers. 

All derivatives are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and do not take into account the effects of master netting arrangements we have with other financial institutions. Credit risk is included in the determination of the estimated fair value of derivatives. Derivative assets are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and derivative liabilities are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other liabilities. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings except for certain changes related to derivative instruments designated as part of a cash flow hedging relationship. 

The following table presents notional amounts and gross fair values of our derivative assets and derivative liabilities which are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

##TABLE_END

Certain derivative exchanges have enacted a rule change which in effect results in the legal characterization of variation margin payments for certain derivative contracts as settlement of the derivatives mark-to-market exposure and not collateral. Accordingly, we have changed our reporting of certain derivatives to record variation margin on trades cleared through these exchanges as settled. The daily settlement of the derivative exposure does not change or reset the contractual terms of the instrument. 

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments under GAAP 

Interest Rate Contracts. We entered into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of certain commercial loans and certain of our FHLB advances from variable rate to fixed rate in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. These agreements are designated as cash flow hedges, hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. The derivative&#8217;s gain or loss, including any ineffectiveness, is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Prior to 2019, any ineffective portion of the gain or loss was reported in earnings immediately. 

The following table shows amounts reclassified from AOCI:

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , the maximum length of time over which forecasted interest cash flows are hedged is 4.9 years. In the twelve months that follow December 31, 2019 , we expect to reclassify from the amount currently reported in AOCI net derivative gains of $ 4.5 million ( $ 3.5 million net of tax), in association with interest on the hedged loans and FHLB advances. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2019 . 

There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to these cash flow hedges. Also, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transactions would not occur. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments under GAAP 

Interest Rate Swaps. We enter into interest rate swap agreements to meet the financing, interest rate and equity risk management needs of qualifying commercial loan customers. These agreements provide the customer the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies and monitoring. Swap derivative transactions with customers are not subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and are generally secured by rights to non-financial collateral, such as real and personal property. 

We enter into positions with a derivative counterparty in order to offset our exposure on the fixed components of the customer interest rate swap agreements. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into transactions only with high-quality financial dealer institutions. 

The interest rate swap agreement with the loan customer and with the counterparty is reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings as other income or other expense. 

Interest Rate Lock Commitments . Interest rate lock commitments represent an agreement to extend credit to a mortgage loan borrower, or an agreement to purchase a loan from a third-party originator, whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding. We are bound to fund the loan at a specified rate, regardless of whether interest rates have changed between the commitment date and the loan funding date, subject to the loan approval process. The borrower is not obligated to perform under the commitment. As such, outstanding IRLCs subject us to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the commitment to the borrower through the loan funding date, or commitment expiration. The IRLCs generally range between 30 to 270 days. The IRLCs are reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings as mortgage banking operations income. 

Forward Delivery Commitments . Forward delivery commitments on mortgage-backed securities are used to manage the interest rate and price risk of our IRLCs and mortgage loan held for sale inventory by fixing the forward sale price that will be realized upon sale of the mortgage loans into the secondary market. Historical commitment-to-closing ratios are considered to estimate the quantity of mortgage loans that will fund within the terms of the IRLCs. The forward delivery contracts are reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings as mortgage banking operations income. 

Credit Risk Contracts. We purchase and sell credit protection under risk participation agreements to share with other counterparties some of the credit exposure related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. We will make/receive payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on their obligation to perform under certain derivative swap contracts. 

Risk participation agreements sold with notional amounts totaling $ 201.5 million as of December 31, 2019 have remaining terms ranging from two months to nine years . Under these agreements, our maximum exposure assuming a customer defaults on their obligation to perform under certain derivative swap contracts with third parties would be $ 0.3 million and $ 0.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The fair values of risk participation agreements purchased and sold were $ 0.1 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively, at December 31, 2019 and $ 0.05 million and $ 0.11 million , respectively, at December 31, 2018 .

Counterparty Credit Risk 

We are party to master netting arrangements with most of our swap derivative dealer counterparties. Collateral, usually marketable securities and/or cash, is exchanged between FNB and our counterparties, and is generally subject to thresholds and transfer minimums. For swap transactions that require central clearing, we post cash to our clearing agency. Collateral positions are settled or valued daily, and adjustments to amounts received and pledged by us are made as appropriate to maintain proper collateralization for these transactions. 

Certain master netting agreements contain provisions that, if violated, could cause the counterparties to request immediate settlement or demand full collateralization under the derivative instrument. If we had breached our agreements with our derivative counterparties we would be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would be required to pay an additional $ 0.1 million and $ 0.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparty. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the net amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the net amounts that would result in the event of offset:

NOTE 15. COMMITMENTS, CREDIT RISK AND CONTINGENCIES 

We have commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that involve certain elements of credit risk in excess of the amount stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the customer is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and leases to customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. 

Following is a summary of off-balance sheet credit risk information: 

TABLE 15.1

&#160;

&#160; 

$ 

7,378 

Standby letters of credit 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2019 , funding of 74.2 % of the commitments to extend credit was dependent on the financial condition of the customer. We have the ability to withdraw such commitments at our discretion. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the customer, collateral may be deemed necessary. Collateral requirements vary and may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us that may require payment at a future date. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is actively monitored through review of the historical performance of our portfolios. 

In addition to the above commitments, subordinated notes issued by FNB Financial Services, LP, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FNB. These subordinated notes are included in the summaries of short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings in Notes 12 and 13. 

Other Legal Proceedings 

In the ordinary course of business, we may assert claims in legal proceedings against another party or parties, and we are routinely named as defendants in, or made parties to, pending and potential legal actions. Also, as regulated entities, we are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, and may be subject to investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal). Such threatened claims, litigation, investigations, regulatory and administrative proceedings typically entail matters that are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. Claims for significant monetary damages may be asserted in many of these types of legal actions, while claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in regulatory matters. In these instances, if we determine that we have meritorious defenses, we will engage in an aggressive defense. However, if management determines, in consultation with counsel, that settlement of a matter is in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders, we may do so. It is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters given their complexity and the particular facts and circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However, on the basis of current knowledge and understanding, and advice of counsel, we do not believe that judgments, sanctions, settlements or orders, if any, that may arise from these matters (either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity, although they could have a material effect on net income in a given period. 

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in litigation and governmental and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the damages sought are indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as a matter of course, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and governmental and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss, fine, penalty, business or adverse reputational impact, if any, associated with each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and governmental and regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. We will continue to monitor such matters for developments that could affect the amount of the accrual, and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency in question is not both probable and 

reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and the matter will continue to be monitored for any developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not material to our consolidated financial position, although future accruals could have a material effect on net income in a given period. 

NOTE 16. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS 

Restricted Stock 

We issue restricted stock awards to key employees under our Incentive Compensation Plan (Plan). We issue time-based awards and performance-based awards under this Plan, both of which are based on a three -year vesting period. The grant date fair value of the time-based awards is equal to the price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of the performance-based awards is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation of our common stock as of the grant date. The assumptions used for this valuation include stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. We issued 353,656 and 283,037 performance-based restricted stock units in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , we had available up to 1,620,243 shares of common stock to issue under this Plan. 

The following table details our issuance of restricted stock units and the aggregate weighted average grant date fair values under these plans for the years indicated:

Warrants 

As of December 31, 2019 , there were no longer any outstanding warrants. The following paragraphs summarize the warrants that were previously issued that have been exercised or expired in 2018 and 2019. 

In conjunction with our participation in the UST&#8217;s CPP, we issued to the UST a warrant to purchase up to 1,302,083 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to Section 13(H) of the Warrant to Purchase Common Stock, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced in half to 651,042 shares on June 16, 2009, the date we completed a public offering. The warrant, which expired in January 2019 without being exercised, was sold at auction by the UST and had an exercise price of $ 11.52 per share. 

In conjunction with the ANNB acquisition on April 6, 2013, the warrant issued by ANNB to the UST under the CPP has been converted into a warrant to purchase up to 342,564 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.57 per share. Subsequent adjustments related to actual dividends paid by us have increased the share amount of these warrants to 405,489 , with a resulting lower exercise price of $ 3.02 per share as of March 31, 2018, prior to being exercised in May 2018. 

In conjunction with the YDKN acquisition on March 11, 2017, the warrant issued by YDKN to the UST under the CPP has been converted into a warrant to purchase up to 207,320 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $ 9.63 per share. Subsequent adjustments related to actual dividends paid by us have increased the share amount of these warrants to 225,439 , with a resulting lower exercise price of $ 8.86 per share as of June 30, 2019. The warrant, which was recorded at its fair value on March 11, 2017, was sold at auction by the UST and was exercised prior to expiring in July 2019. 

NOTE 17. RETIREMENT PLANS 

We sponsor the Retirement Income Plan (RIP), a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that has been frozen. The RIP covered employees who satisfied minimum age and length of service requirements. Although not required, during 2019 , we made a $ 5.0 million contribution to the RIP. 

We also sponsor two supplemental non-qualified retirement plans that have been frozen. The ERISA Excess Retirement Plan provides retirement benefits equal to the difference, if any, between the maximum benefit allowable under the Internal Revenue Code and the amount that would be provided under the RIP, if no limits were applied. The Basic Retirement Plan (BRP) is applicable to certain officers whom the Board of Directors designates. Officers participating in the BRP receive a benefit based on a target benefit percentage based on years of service at retirement and a designated tier as determined by the Board of Directors. When a participant retires, the benefit under the BRP is a monthly benefit equal to the participant's aggregate target benefit percentage multiplied by the participant&#8217;s highest average monthly cash compensation, including bonuses, during five consecutive calendar years within the last ten calendar years of employment before 2009. This monthly benefit is reduced by the monthly benefit the participant receives from the Social Security Administration, the RIP, the ERISA Excess Retirement Plan and the annuity equivalent of the automatic contributions paid to participants under the qualified 401(k) defined contribution plan and the ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan. 

The following tables provide information relating to the accumulated benefit obligation, change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, the plans&#8217; funded status and the amount included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the qualified and non-qualified plans described above (collectively, the Plans):

##TABLE_END

The unrecognized actuarial loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation are required to be recognized into earnings over the average remaining participant life due to the freezing of the RIP, which may, on a net basis reduce future earnings. 

Actuarial assumptions used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation in the Plans are as follows:

##TABLE_END

The discount rate assumption at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was determined using a yield-curve based approach. A yield curve was produced for a universe containing the majority of U.S.-issued Aa-graded corporate bonds, all of which were non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions), and after excluding the 10% of the bonds with the highest and lowest yields. The discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. 

The net periodic pension cost and other comprehensive income for the Plans included the following components:

##TABLE_END

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets has been established by considering historical and anticipated expected returns on the asset classes invested in by the pension trust and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. 

The change in plan assets reflects benefits paid from the qualified pension plans of $ 10.0 million and $ 10.1 million for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As stated above, we made a $ 5.0 million contribution to the RIP during 2019 . We made a $ 4.0 million contribution to the RIP during 2018. For the non-qualified pension plans, the change in plan assets reflects benefits paid from and contributions made to the plans in the same amount. This amount represents the actual benefit payments paid from general assets of $ 1.5 million for 2019 and $ 1.4 million for 2018 . 

The following table provides information regarding estimated future cash flows relating to the Plans at December 31, 2019 :

##TABLE_END

The qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into a trust and the qualified benefit payments are made from trust assets. For the non-qualified plans, the contributions and the benefit payments are the same and reflect expected benefit amounts, which we pay from general assets. 

Our subsidiaries participate in a qualified 401(k) defined contribution plan under which employees may contribute a percentage of their salary. Employees are eligible to participate upon their first day of employment. Under this plan, we match 100 % of the first 6 % that the employee defers. During the second quarter of 2018, we made a one-time discretionary contribution of $ 0.9 million to the vast majority of our employees following the tax reform that was enacted in December 2017. Additionally, we may provide a performance-based company contribution of up to 3 % if we exceed annual financial goals. Our contribution expense is presented in the following table:

We also sponsor an ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan for certain officers. This plan provides retirement benefits equal to the difference, if any, between the maximum benefit allowable under the Internal Revenue Code and the amount that would have been provided under the qualified 401(k) defined contribution plan, if no limits were applied. 

Pension Plan Investment Policy and Strategy 

Our investment strategy for the RIP is to diversify plan assets between a wide mix of securities within the equity and debt markets to allow the account the opportunity to meet the expected long-term rate of return requirements while minimizing short-term volatility. In this regard, the plan has targeted allocations within the equity securities category for domestic large cap, domestic mid cap, domestic small cap, real estate investment trusts, emerging market and international securities. Within the debt securities category, the plan has targeted allocation levels for U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, domestic investment-grade bonds, high-yield bonds, inflation-protected securities and international bonds. 

The following table presents asset allocations for our pension plans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the target allocation for 2020 , by asset category:

NOTE 18. INCOME TAXES 

The TCJA included several changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% , which became effective January 1, 2018. We recognized the initial income tax effects of the TCJA in our 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SAB No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC 740, Income Taxes , in the reporting period in which the TCJA was signed into law. We recorded a provisional amount of $ 54.0 million at December 31, 2017 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. Upon final analysis of available information and refinement of our calculations during 2018, we decreased our provisional amount by $ 1.9 million which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. We consider the TCJA remeasurement of our deferred taxes to be complete. 

The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax balances are applicable even in situations in which the related income tax effects of such items were originally recognized in other comprehensive income. This results in stranded tax effects for items that were recorded in AOCI rather than in income from continuing operations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we elected to change our accounting policy to reclassify the income tax effects related to the TCJA of approximately $ 14.7 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This change in accounting policy results in the appropriate tax rate being recognized in AOCI for debt and equity investments, certain derivative transactions, and pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

The effective tax rates of 17.7 % and 17.6 % in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, were lower than the 21% TCJA statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits resulting from renewable energy investment and historic tax credits, tax-exempt income on investments and loans and income from BOLI. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized net investment tax credits of $ 7.9 million and $ 6.5 million , respectively.

Deferred Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes. DTAs and DTLs are measured based on the enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. 

The following table presents the tax effects of significant temporary differences that give rise to federal and state DTAs and DTLs:

##TABLE_END

We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefit of the DTAs or when future deductibility is uncertain. Periodically, the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on management&#8217;s assessment of realizable DTAs. As of December 31, 2019 , the valuation allowance of $ 28 million primarily relates to unused federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expiring from 2020 to 2039 . We anticipate that neither the state net operating loss carryforwards nor the other net DTAs at certain of our subsidiaries will be utilized and, as such, have recorded a valuation allowance against the DTAs related to these items. 

As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $ 27.4 million of federal net operating loss and built-in loss carryforwards, $ 2.0 million of federal tax credit carryforwards, and $ 5.7 million of state tax credit carryforwards to which we succeeded as a result of the YDKN acquisition. The utilization of these tax attributes is subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or a similar state-level statute, which will cause the utilization of these attributes to be deferred over a number of years, not to exceed beyond 2036 . We have determined that we will likely have sufficient taxable income in the years during which these tax attributes are available to be utilized and, consequently, have determined that no additional valuation allowance against the recorded DTA is warranted. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

We account for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we have approximately $ 1.6 million and $ 0.9 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2019 , $ 1.4 million of these tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. To the extent interest is not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. 

We file numerous income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in several state jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2016 . With limited exception, we are no longer subject to state income tax examinations for years prior to 2016 . We anticipate that a reduction in the unrecognized tax benefit of up to $ 0.06 million may occur in the next twelve months from the expiration of statutes of limitations which would result in a reduction in income taxes.

NOTE 21. REGULATORY MATTERS 

FNB and FNBPA are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require FNB and FNBPA to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, tier 1 and common equity tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of leverage ratio (as defined). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, dividends and future business and corporate strategies. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, FNB and FNBPA must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. FNB&#8217;s and FNBPA&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the most recent notification from the federal banking agencies categorized FNB and FNBPA as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the respective regulatory frameworks. There are no conditions or events since the notification which management believes have changed this categorization.

(1) Reflects the well-capitalized standard under Regulation Y for F.N.B. Corporation and the prompt corrective action framework for FNBPA. 

In accordance with Basel III standards, the implementation of capital requirements is transitional and was phased-in from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. The minimum capital requirements plus capital conservation buffer, which are presented for each period above based on the phase-in schedule, represent the minimum requirements needed to avoid limitations on distributions of dividends and certain discretionary bonus payments. 

Due to usable vault cash, the aggregate cash reserves FNBPA was required to maintain with the FRB amounted to less than $1 million at December 31, 2019 . We also maintain deposits for various services such as check clearing. Certain limitations exist under applicable law and regulations by regulatory agencies regarding dividend distributions to a parent by our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019 , our subsidiaries had $ 527.3 million of retained earnings available for distribution to us without prior regulatory approval. 

Under current FRB regulations, FNBPA is limited in the amount it may lend to non-bank affiliates, including FNB. Such loans must be secured by specified collateral. In addition, any such loans to a non-bank affiliate may not exceed 10% of FNBPA&#8217;s capital and surplus and the aggregate of loans to all such affiliates may not exceed 20% of FNBPA&#8217;s capital and surplus. The maximum amount that may be borrowed by FNB affiliates under these provisions was $ 598.3 million at December 31, 2019 .

NOTE 23. BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

We operate in three reportable segments: Community Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Community Banking segment provides commercial and consumer banking services. Commercial banking solutions include corporate banking, small business banking, investment real estate financing, business credit, capital markets and lease financing. Consumer banking products and services include deposit products, mortgage lending, consumer lending and a complete suite of mobile and online banking services. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Wealth Management segment provides a broad range of personal and corporate fiduciary services including the administration of decedent and trust estates. In addition, it offers various alternative products, including securities brokerage and investment advisory services, mutual funds and annuities. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Insurance segment includes a full-service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers. The Insurance segment also includes a reinsurer. 

##TABLE_END We also previously operated a Consumer Finance segment, which is no longer a reportable segment. This segment primarily made installment loans to individuals and purchased installment sales finance contracts from retail merchants. On August 31, 2018, as part of our strategy to enhance the overall positioning of our consumer banking operations, we sold 100 percent of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Regency to Mariner Finance, LLC. This transaction was completed to accomplish several strategic objectives, including enhancing the credit risk profile of the consumer loan portfolio, offering additional liquidity and selling a non-strategic business segment that no longer fits with our core business. Regency's financial information is included in the Consumer Finance segment in the 2018 and 2017 tables that follow. 

The following tables provide financial information for these segments of FNB. The information provided under the caption &#8220;Parent and Other&#8221; represents operations not considered to be reportable segments and/or general operating expenses of FNB, and includes the parent company, other non-bank subsidiaries and eliminations and adjustments to reconcile to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 24. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities AFS, mortgage loans held for sale accounted for under FVO and derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans, OREO and certain other assets. 

Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are not adjusted for transaction costs. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity-specific measure. 

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including market, income and cost approaches. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, which are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, which are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: 

TABLE 24.1 

##TABLE_START Measurement 

Category 

&#160; 

Definition 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Level 1 

&#160; 

valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Level 2 

&#160; 

valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, 

quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active 

and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in 

the market or can be corroborated by market data. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Level 3 

&#160; 

valuation is derived from other valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow models 

and similar techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These 

unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would 

use in determining fair value. 

##TABLE_END

A financial instrument&#8217;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies we use for financial instruments recorded at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis: 

Securities Available For Sale 

These securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2019 , 100.0 % of AFS securities used valuation methodologies involving market-based or market-derived information, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to measure fair value. 

We closely monitor market conditions involving assets that have become less actively traded. If the fair value measurement is based upon recent observable market activity of such assets or comparable assets (other than forced or distressed transactions) that occur in sufficient volume, and do not require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs, those assets are classified as Level 1 or Level 2; if not, they are classified as Level 3. Making this assessment requires significant judgment. 

We use prices from independent pricing services and, to a lesser extent, indicative (non-binding) quotes from independent brokers, to measure the fair value of AFS securities. We validate prices received from pricing services or brokers using a 

variety of methods, including, but not limited to, comparison to secondary pricing services, corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent market data such as secondary broker quotes and relevant benchmark indices, and review of pricing information by corporate personnel familiar with market liquidity and other market-related conditions. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

We determine fair value for derivatives using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity and uses observable market based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. 

We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. 

Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives and IRLCs utilize Level 3 inputs. Credit valuation estimates of current credit spreads are used to evaluate the likelihood of our default and the default of our counterparties. However, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our non-IRLC derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of IRLCs is based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, including the expected cash flows related to MSRs and the estimated percentage of IRLCs that will result in a closed mortgage loan, and is classified as Level 3. 

Loans Held For Sale 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the FVO. Fair value for residential mortgage loans held for sale, when recorded, is based on independent quoted market prices and is classified as Level 2. 

SBA loans held for sale are carried under lower of cost or fair value, for which, periodically, it may be necessary to record non-recurring fair value adjustments. Fair value for SBA loans held for sale, when recorded, is based on independent quoted market prices and is classified as Level 2. 

Impaired Loans 

We reserve for commercial loan relationships greater than or equal to $ 1.0 million that we consider impaired as defined in ASC 310 at the time we identify the loan as impaired based upon the present value of expected future cash flows available to pay the loan, or based upon the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs where a loan is collateral dependent. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. 

We determine the fair value of real estate based on appraisals by licensed or certified appraisers. The value of business assets is generally based on amounts reported on the business&#8217; financial statements. Management must rely on the financial statements prepared and certified by the borrower or their accountants in determining the value of these business assets on an ongoing basis, which may be subject to significant change over time. Based on the quality of information or statements provided, management may require the use of business asset appraisals and site-inspections to better value these assets. We may discount appraised and reported values based on management&#8217;s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation or management&#8217;s knowledge of the borrower and the borrower&#8217;s business. Since not all valuation inputs are observable, we classify these non-recurring fair value determinations as Level 2 or Level 3 based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

We review and evaluate impaired loans no less frequently than quarterly for additional impairment based on the same factors identified above. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

OREO is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. OREO acquired in settlement of indebtedness is recorded at the lower of carrying amount of the loan or fair value less costs to sell. Subsequently, these assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Accordingly, it may be necessary to record non-recurring fair value adjustments. Fair value is generally based upon appraisals by licensed or certified appraisers and other market information and is classified as Level 3. 

Other Assets - MSRs and SBA Servicing Assets 

We carry MSRs at the lower of cost or fair value, and therefore, they are subject to fair value measurements on a non-recurring basis. Since sales of MSRs tend to occur in private transactions and the precise terms and conditions of the sales are typically not readily available, there is a limited market to refer to in determining the fair value of MSRs. As such we rely primarily on a discounted cash flow model, incorporating assumptions about loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors, to estimate the fair value of our MSRs. We utilize a third-party vendor to perform the modeling to estimate the fair value of our MSRs. Since the valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs, we classify MSRs within Level 3. 

We retain the servicing rights on SBA-guaranteed loans sold to investors. The standard sale structure under the SBA Secondary Participation Guaranty Agreement provides for us to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the SBA guaranteed portion of the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. We utilize a third-party vendor to perform the modeling to estimate the fair value of our SBA servicing asset. Since the valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs, we classify SBA servicing assets within Level 3. 

The following table presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

##TABLE_END

We review fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out of Level 3 at fair value at the beginning of the period in which the changes occur. See the &#8220;Securities Available for Sale&#8221; discussion within 

this footnote for information relating to determining Level 3 fair values. There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between the hierarchy levels during 2019 or 2018 . 

For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recorded in earnings $ 0.6 million of unrealized gains relating to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 and market value adjustments on marketable equity securities. These unrealized gains included in earnings are in the other non-interest income line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

From time to time, we measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of the lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Valuation methodologies used to measure these fair value adjustments were previously described. For assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis still held at the Balance Sheet date, the following table provides the hierarchy level and the fair value of the related assets or portfolios:

##TABLE_END

Substantially all of the fair value amounts in the table above were estimated at a date during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Consequently, the fair value information presented is not necessarily as of the period&#8217;s end. MSRs measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis of $ 31.4 million had a valuation allowance of $ 1.5 million , bringing the December 31, 2019 carrying value to $ 29.9 million . The valuation allowance includes a provision expense included in 2019 earnings of $ 1.0 million . 

Impaired loans measured or re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2019 had a carrying amount of $ 4.8 million which includes an allocated allowance for credit losses of $ 3.7 million . The allowance for credit losses includes a provision applicable to the current period fair value measurements of $ 6.2 million , which was included in the provision for credit losses for 2019 . 

OREO with a carrying amount of $ 3.6 million was written down to $ 2.2 million , resulting in a loss of $ 1.4 million , which was included in earnings for 2019 . 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each financial instrument: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accrued Interest Receivable and Accrued Interest Payable. For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Securities. For both securities AFS and securities HTM, fair value equals the quoted market price from an active market, if available, and is classified within Level 1. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities or pricing models, and is classified as Level 2. Where there is limited market activity or significant valuation inputs are unobservable, securities are classified within Level 3. Under current market conditions, assumptions used to determine the fair value of Level 3 securities have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market transactions. 

Loans and Leases. The fair value of fixed rate loans and leases is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans and leases would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities less an illiquidity discount, as the fair value measurement represents an exit price from a market 

participants' viewpoint. The fair value of variable and adjustable rate loans and leases approximates the carrying amount. Due to the significant judgment involved in evaluating credit quality, loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Loan Servicing Rights . For both MSRs and SBA servicing rights, both classified as Level 3 assets, fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation method. These models use significant unobservable inputs including discount rates, prepayment rates and cost to service which have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market transactions. 

Derivative Assets and Liabilities. See the &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; discussion included within this footnote . 

Deposits. The estimated fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date because of the customers&#8217; ability to withdraw funds immediately. The fair value of fixed-maturity deposits is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Short-Term Borrowings. The carrying amounts for short-term borrowings approximate fair value for amounts that mature in 90 days or less. The fair value of subordinated notes is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently offered. 

Long-Term Borrowings. The fair value of long-term borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows based on the market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. 

Loan Commitments and Standby Letters of Credit. Estimates of the fair value of these off-balance sheet items were not made because of the short-term nature of these arrangements and the credit standing of the counterparties. Also, unfunded loan commitments relate principally to variable rate commercial loans, typically are non-binding, and fees are not normally assessed on these balances. 

Nature of Estimates . Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly, the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates may not be comparable to other financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made. Further, because the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the Balance Sheet date, the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various financial instruments could be significantly different. 

The fair values of our financial instruments are as follows:

NOTE 27. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS 

Yadkin Financial Corporation 

On March 11, 2017, we completed our acquisition of YDKN, a bank holding company based in Raleigh, North Carolina. YDKN&#8217;s banking affiliate, Yadkin Bank, was also merged into FNBPA on March 11, 2017. YDKN&#8217;s results of operations have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Income since that date. The acquisition enabled us to enter several southeastern markets, including Raleigh, Charlotte and the Piedmont Triad, which is comprised of Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point. We also completed the core systems conversion activities during the first quarter of 2017. 

On the acquisition date, the fair values of YDKN included $ 6.8 billion in assets, of which there was $ 5.1 billion in loans and $ 5.2 billion in deposits. The acquisition was valued at $ 1.8 billion based on the acquisition-date FNB common stock closing price of $ 15.97 and resulted in FNB issuing 111,619,622 shares of our common stock in exchange for 51,677,565 shares of YDKN common stock. Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of YDKN received 2.16 shares of FNB common stock for each share of YDKN common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. YDKN&#8217;s fully vested and outstanding stock options were converted into options to purchase and receive FNB common stock. In conjunction with the acquisition, we assumed a warrant that was issued by YDKN to the UST under the CPP. Based on the exchange ratio, this warrant was converted into a warrant to purchase up to 207,320 shares of FNB common stock with an exercise price of $ 9.63 . The warrant was exercised in 2019. 

The acquisition of YDKN constituted a business combination and has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. The determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about 

discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and may require adjustments, which can be updated for up to a year following the acquisition. Any adjustments to fair values and related adjustments to goodwill were recorded within the 12-month period. Based on the purchase price allocation, we recorded $ 1.2 billion in goodwill and $ 70.0 million in core deposit intangibles as a result of the acquisition. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes as the acquisition is accounted for as a tax-free exchange for tax purposes.

In connection with the YDKN acquisition, we incurred expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into FNB. These merger-related expenses, that were expensed as incurred, amounted to $ 56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Contract terminations and severance costs comprised 30.9 % and 24.3 % , respectively, of the merger-related expenses, with the remainder consisting of other non-interest expenses, including professional services, marketing and advertising, technology and communications, occupancy and equipment, and charitable contributions. We also incurred issuance costs of $ 0.6 million which were charged to additional paid-in capital.
