 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations at and for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained herein and our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020. Our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full year. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

We make statements in this Report and may from time-to-time make other statements regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset quality levels, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations. These statements can be considered &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve various assumptions, risks and uncertainties which can change over time. Actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and may not align with historical performance and events. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "plan," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "will," "should," "project," "goal," and other similar words and expressions. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws. 

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: 

&#8226; Our business, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) developments with respect to the U.S. and global financial markets; (ii) actions by the FRB, UST, OCC and other governmental agencies, especially those that impact money supply, market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry; (iii) a slowing of the U.S. economic environment; and (iv) the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the U.S. or its global trading partners. 

&#8226; Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 

&#8226; Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, and on credit spreads, deposit gathering and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and continue to respond to technological changes and COVID-19 challenges can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. 

&#8226; Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, significant political events, cyber-attacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally, or on us or our counterparties specifically. 

&#8226; Legal, regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and the ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include: 

&#9702; Changes resulting from a U.S. presidential administration or legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, regulatory obligations or restrictions, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. 

&#9702; Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards. 

&#9702; Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to FNB. 

&#9702; Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies. 

&#9702; The impact on our financial condition, results of operations, financial disclosures and future business strategies related to the implementation of the new FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses commonly referred to as the &#8220;current expected credit loss&#8221; standard, or CECL. 

&#9702; A failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or campaigns. 

&#8226; The COVID-19 pandemic and the regulatory and governmental actions implemented in response to COVID-19 have resulted in significant deterioration and disruption in financial markets, national and local economic conditions and record levels of unemployment and could have a material impact on, among other things, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, or on our management, employees, customers and critical vendors and suppliers. In view of the many unknowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our forward-looking statements continue to be subject to various conditions that may be substantially different than what we are currently expecting, including, but not limited to, a weakened U.S. economic recovery, prolonged economic recovery, deterioration of commercial and consumer customer fundamentals and sentiments, and impairment of the recovery of the U.S. labor market. As a result, the COVID-19 outbreaks and its consequences, including responsive measures to manage it and the uncertainty regarding its duration, may possibly have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial performance. 

The risks identified here are not exclusive. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors and other uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors and Risk Management sections of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the MD&#38;A section), our subsequent 2020 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including the risk factors and risk management discussions) and our other subsequent filings with the SEC, which are available on our corporate website at https://www.fnb-online.com/about-us/investor-relations-shareholder-services. More specifically, our forward-looking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its macro-economic impact and the resulting governmental, business and societal responses to it. We have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only. Information on our website is not part of this Report. 

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

A description of our critical accounting policies is included in the MD&#38;A section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020 under the heading &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221;. On January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL. Under the CECL methodology, the ACL represents the expected lifetime credit losses on loans and leases that we don't expect to collect. Additionally, see our critical accounting policy on goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases resulting in the net amount expected to be collected. We charge off loans against the ACL in accordance with our policies or if a loss confirming event occurs. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of the amounts previously charged off and expected to be charged off. 

The model used to calculate the ACL is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality, as well as historical experience, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates. Specifically, the following considerations are incorporated into the ACL calculation: a third-party macroeconomic forecast scenario; a 24-month R&#38;S forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period; and the historical through-the-cycle mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period. 

Adjustments to historical loss information, where applicable, are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in lending policies and procedures, underwriting standards, experience and depth of relevant personnel, the quality of our credit review function, concentrations of credit, external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events such as natural disasters and other relevant factors. Such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect management's expectation of future conditions based on a R&#38;S forecast. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a R&#38;S forecast can be made, the model reverts over 12 months on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss over the remaining life of the loans. 

Determining the appropriateness of the ACL is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation, significant changes to the ACL level could occur in future periods. 

See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and the Financial Condition, Allowance for Credit Losses section later in this MD&#38;A for further allowance for credit losses information. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

As a result of acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. Our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our Community Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance segments. 

The value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high-quality, cost-effective services in the face of competition. As such, these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value, which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods. 

Goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which must be conducted at least annually. We perform impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts, as necessary. In connection with the preparation of the third quarter 2020 financial statements, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Community Banking reporting unit was below its carrying amount due to a sustained decline in bank stock valuations, which was primarily attributable to the systemic near-term uncertainty of COVID-19 and its full impact on the global economy which caused an unprecedented shock in interest rates and equity valuations. Therefore, we performed an interim quantitative assessment of our Community Banking reporting unit. The September 30, 2020 interim quantitative assessment for our Community Banking reporting unit, with $2.2 billion of allocated goodwill, resulted in an excess fair value over its carrying amount of less than 5%, which is stable from June 30, 2020. Based on the results of the interim quantitative impairment assessments, there were no impairments for the periods presented. Although not impaired, the fair value of our Community Banking reporting unit remains relatively close to carrying value. 

As margins for fair value over carrying amount decline, the risk of future impairment increases if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. We expect COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact during the remainder of 2020 resulting in lower revenue growth and compressed net interest margins. Given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic, and the impact across the financial services industry, we may be required to record impairment in the future. Any impairment charge would not affect our capital ratios, tangible common equity, tangible book value per share or liquidity position. Determining fair values of each reporting unit, of its individual assets and liabilities, and also of other identifiable intangible assets requires considering market information that is publicly available, as well as the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value include projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, long-term growth rates and an evaluation of market comparables and recent transactions. The annual test for impairment is performed in the fourth quarter each year and will include an update to our long-range forecast. 

See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 7, &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 

To supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating earnings per diluted common share, return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, allowance for credit losses to loans and leases, excluding PPP loans, pre-provision net revenue to average tangible common equity, efficiency ratio and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature, and not as a substitute for or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. When non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed, the SEC's Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included later in this report under the heading &#8220;Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators to GAAP&#8221;. 

Management believes charges such as branch consolidation costs, certain service charge refunds and COVID-19 expenses are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. These charges are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities. The branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction, and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. Similarly, gains derived from the sale of Visa class B stock and losses on FHLB debt extinguishment and related hedge terminations are not organic to our operations. The COVID-19 expenses represent special Company initiatives to support our front-line employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic. 

To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets (loans and investments) to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments (this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP). Taxable-equivalent amounts for the 2020 and 2019 periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. 

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 

Net income available to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $80.8 million or $0.25 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2019 of $100.7 million or $0.31 per diluted common share. On an operating basis, the third quarter of 2020 earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was $0.26, excluding $0.01 for significant items. 

We achieved positive third quarter financial results during this challenging economic environment prompted by the global pandemic. Our performance is directly attributable to our resilient business model, which is based upon the deployment of technology and expansion into attractive new markets. The financial results reflect continued average loan and deposit growth and record fee income levels. We also strengthened our capital ratios while sustaining our quarterly dividend. 

Income Statement Highlights (Third quarter of 2020 compared to third quarter of 2019, except as noted) 

&#8226; Total revenue of $307.1 million, compared to $309.8 million, down 0.9%, and up 0.5% compared to $305.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Net income available to common stockholders was $80.8 million, compared to $100.7 million, down 19.8% from the third quarter of 2019, and down slightly compared to $81.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Earnings per diluted common share were $0.25, compared to $0.31, down 19.4% in the third quarter of 2019, and flat compared to $0.25 in the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) declined 38 basis points to 2.79% from 3.17%, attributable to lower levels of interest rates as the quarterly average 1-month LIBOR rate decreased from 2.18% in the third quarter of 2019 to 0.16% in the third quarter of 2020. These decreases were largely offset by growth in average earning assets, reductions in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and strong growth in non-interest-bearing deposits. 

&#8226; Non-interest income was stable at $80.0 million, with an increase of $9.1 million, or 93.1%, in record levels of mortgage banking income offset by a decrease of $8.9 million, or 26.7%, in service charges, given significantly lower transaction volumes in the COVID-19 environment and service charge refunds of $3.8 million. 

&#8226; The termination of $415 million in higher-rate FHLB borrowings with an average rate of 2.59% resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment and related hedge termination costs of $13.3 million. 

&#8226; There was a $13.8 million gain on the sale of all of the Bank's holdings of Visa Class B shares. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses of $27.2 million exceeded net charge-offs of $19.3 million. The annualized net charge-offs to total average loans ratio was 0.29%, compared to 0.11%. 

&#8226; Income tax expense decreased $0.4 million, or 2.5%, and the effective tax rate was 17.0%, compared to 14.5%, primarily due to a greater benefit from renewable energy investment tax credits realized during the third quarter of 2019. 

&#8226; The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) equaled 55.26%, compared to 54.11%. 

&#8226; Return on average tangible common equity ratio (non-GAAP) was 13.34%, compared to 17.41%. 

Balance Sheet Highlights (period-end balances, September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, unless otherwise indicated) 

&#8226; Total assets were $37.4 billion, compared to $34.6 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 8.2%, primarily due to the origination of PPP loans, of which $2.5 billion was outstanding as of September 30, 2020. 

&#8226; Growth in total average loans compared to the third quarter of 2019 was $3.3 billion, or 14.7%, with average commercial loan growth of $3.3 billion, or 22.9%, and average consumer loan growth of $57.1 million, or 0.7%. Total loan growth included $2.6 billion of net PPP commercial loans originated in 2020. 

&#8226; Total average deposits grew $4.3 billion, or 17.8%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in average non-interest-bearing deposits of $2.5 billion, or 39.7%, and an increase in interest-bearing demand deposits of $2.6 billion, or 25.9%, partially offset by a managed decrease in average time deposits of $1.2 billion, or 22.4%. Growth in average deposits reflected inflows from the PPP and government stimulus activities, in addition to organic growth in new and existing customer relationships. 

&#8226; The ratio of loans to deposits was 89.1%, compared to 94.0%, as deposit growth outpaced loan growth and $508 million of indirect auto installment loans were transferred to loans held for sale in September 2020 in anticipation of a loan sale expected to close in the fourth quarter. 

&#8226; Additionally, the dividend payout ratio for the third quarter of 2020 was 48.7%, compared to 39.0%. 

&#8226; The ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases increased to 1.45% from 0.84% at December 31, 2019, representing the impact of the CECL adoption and COVID-19 related impacts on our ACL modeling results in the first nine months of 2020. Excluding PPP loans that do not carry an ACL due to a 100% government guarantee, the ACL to total loan and leases ratio (non-GAAP) equaled 1.61%, or an impact of 16 basis points. 

&#8226; Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) of $7.81 increased 7% from September 30, 2019. 

&#8226; The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP) decreased 25 basis points to 7.19%, due primarily to the PPP loan impact and the Day 1 CECL adoption impact compared to the year-ago quarter. The ratio increased 22 basis points compared to 6.97% at June 30, 2020 with net PPP loan balances negatively impacting the September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020 TCE ratios by 56 and 53 basis points, respectively.

Industry Developments 

COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immense human and economic impact on the global economy. On March 22, 2020, the UST announced that financial institution employees are part of the critical infrastructure workforce and stated that these employees have a &#8220;special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule.&#8221; As a result, financial institutions were confronted with the challenge of protecting the health and safety of their employees, while also ensuring that critical financial services such as providing consumer access to banking and lending services, maintaining core systems and the integrity and security of data, continuing the processing of payments and services, such as clearing and settlement services, wholesale funding, insurance services and capital markets activities, for the duration of the pandemic crisis period. 

Our crisis and risk management processes were critical to our preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic since we had the necessary plans in place and had conducted a pandemic emergency event scenario (involving key management and operations employees) in the fourth quarter of 2019 to test the efficacy of our pandemic response plans and to improve these plans. We are well positioned to continue providing critical financial services to our customers through multiple channels such as interactive teller machines, automated teller machines, our mobile application, and our interactive website. We adjusted our physical retail locations by focusing on &#8220;drive up&#8221; services and closed our lobbies, reverting to &#8220;by appointment only&#8221; practices, while maintaining appropriate health, sanitization, social distancing and other safety protocols consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state guidelines. Based on the available COVID-19 federal data, we began to re-open our branch lobbies to customers in July 2020 while adhering to CDC safety measures, including employee and customer safety (i.e., masks), social distancing and cleaning protocols, while continuing to regularly monitor and adjust branch hours based on local COVID-19 conditions and circumstances. 

We leveraged our information technology infrastructure by making accommodations to give employees the ability to work remotely where appropriate. Our executive and senior management worked rotating schedules or from remote offices or home in order to mitigate the risk of wide-spread occurrence of the COVID-19 contagion among this group. With respect to our other employees, approximately half of our workforce worked remotely. We will continue to actively monitor case levels and consider guidance from government agencies to determine when we activate further "return-to-the workplace" schedules. Our remote and rotational working arrangements and implementation of CDC health and safety protocols have not impaired our ability to continue to operate our business. We do rely on some third parties for certain services. At this time, we have not experienced a disruption in those services. 

To protect our customers and communities from economic disruption, we: 

&#8226; developed a formal loan deferral program and other measures to support customers who may be enduring financial hardships; and 

&#8226; actively participated in the SBA PPP, which authorized financial institutions to make federally guaranteed loans that are eligible to be forgiven to qualifying small businesses and nonprofits on the terms set forth in the CARES Act and related regulations. 

We continue to evaluate other COVID-19 related FRB and federal government relief and stimulus programs to determine their suitability for our customers and communities. 

COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the provision for credit losses during 2020 after the adoption of CECL. The uncertainty in the market, a significant increase in unemployment, and adverse economic forecasts all point to the volatility of the expected additional losses in the loan portfolio. We would expect inherent volatility in the COVID-19 impact on our provision for credit losses for the duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic environment and immediate periods following the mitigation of the pandemic crisis. 

The federal banking regulators have offered certain measures to assist financial institutions during this time. Some of these that impact us are as follows: 

&#8226; As part of Section 4013 of the CARES Act and in accordance with federal bank regulatory interagency guidance, financial institutions have been granted temporary relief from reporting TDRs caused by COVID-19. To be eligible for TDR relief, a loan modification must be due to impacts from COVID-19, not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the national emergency. Interagency guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of 

COVID-19, and will not criticize financial institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Loan modification programs are considered positive actions that can mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19. Institutions generally do not need to categorize COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs if the loan modifications are short-term in nature and are made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current at the time the modification program was implemented. For borrowers who were current prior to COVID-19 that have requested and been granted a concession while experiencing a hardship during the pandemic, we will not be including those modifications as past due or a TDR at the time of the concession. As of June 30, 2020, approximately $2.4 billion, or 10%, of our loan portfolio was approved during the initial deferment request window. Over 98% of the $2.4 billion of loans in deferment were current and in good standing at December 31, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, total deferrals decreased to $792 million or 3.4% of total loans and leases (excluding PPP loans) which includes second deferrals of $464 million, or 2.0% of total loans and leases (excluding PPP loans). The remaining loans in deferral were still in their first deferral period. Total deferrals decreased to 2.90% at October 15, 2020. 

&#8226; The regulatory agencies have agreed to allow an option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital by two years for those financial institutions that adopt in 2020. This delay will be followed by a three-year transition period of 75%, 50%, and 25% respectively. We adopted CECL in January 2020 and have elected this option. 

&#8226; The FRB initiated a facility to provide liquidity to financial institutions participating and funding loans for the PPP. The non-recourse loans are available to institutions eligible to make PPP loans, with the SBA-guaranteed loans pledged as collateral to the FRB. Financial institutions can also pledge PPP loans to the discount window. Each liquidity option is set at different rates and terms. PPP loans pledged to the PPPLF may be excluded from leverage ratio calculations. We have not utilized this facility, as we have ample liquidity. 

As we continue to manage through the COVID-19 challenges and meet the needs of our various constituents, our focus continues to be on our four key pillars. The pillars are: employee protection and assistance; operational response and preparedness; customer and community support; and risk management and actions taken to preserve shareholder value given the extreme challenges presented.

The United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who is the regulator of LIBOR, expects LIBOR to cease to exist by the end of 2021. The FRB of New York has created a working group called the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) that will help U.S. institutions transition away from using LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate. Similarly, we created an internal working group that is managing our transition away from LIBOR. This working group is a cross-functional team composed of representatives from the commercial, retail and mortgage banking lines of business, loan operations, information technology, legal, finance and other support functions. The committee has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition, identified contracts that contain LIBOR language, is in process of reviewing existing contract language, developed loan fallback language for when LIBOR ceases to exist and identified risks associated with the transition. The financial impact regarding pricing, valuation and operations of the transition is not yet known. Our transition team will work within the guidelines established by the FCA and ARRC to allow a smooth transition away from LIBOR. During the third quarter of 2020, we finalized the transition of new adjustable rate mortgages away from the LIBOR index to the Standard Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The effective date for this change is October 1, 2020. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 

Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $80.8 million or $0.25 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2019 of $100.7 million or $0.31 per diluted common share. The results for the third quarter of 2020 reflect a provision for credit losses of $27.2 million in a recessionary environment under the CECL requirements, compared to $11.9 million for the third quarter of 2019. Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2020 included record mortgage banking income of $18.8 million and the following significant items: a $13.8 million gain on the sale of all of the Bank's holdings of Visa class B shares, a loss on debt extinguishment and related hedge termination costs of $13.3 million and $3.8 million of service charge refunds. Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2020 included COVID-19 related expenses of $2.7 million.

(2) The interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

(3) Average balances include non-accrual loans. Loans and leases consist of average total loans less average unearned income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) decreased $3.2 million, or 1.4%, from $233.3 million for the third quarter of 2019 to $230.1 million for the third quarter of 2020. Average interest-earning assets of $32.9 billion increased $3.6 billion, or 12.2%, from 2019, due to solid origination activity across our footprint and benefits from PPP activity. Average interest-bearing liabilities of $23.5 billion increased $1.0 billion, or 4.5%, from 2019, driven by deposits for PPP funding and government stimulus activities, as well as solid organic growth in customer relationships, which was partially offset by reduced levels of borrowings. Our net interest margin FTE (non-GAAP) declined 38 basis points to 2.79%, as earning asset yields decreased 97 basis points primarily reflecting the impact on the variable rate loans of significant reductions in 1-month LIBOR and the Prime rate. Partially offsetting the lower earning asset yields, the total cost of funds improved 61 basis points to 0.56%, compared to 1.17%, due to a 70 basis point reduction in interest-bearing deposit costs and lower borrowing costs. 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volumes and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019:

(1) The amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes. 

(2) Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $275.4 million for the third quarter of 2020, decreased $42.5 million or 13.4% from the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to the repricing impact from lower interest rates, partially offset by increased interest-earning assets of $3.6 billion. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily driven by a $3.3 billion, or 14.7%, increase in average loans and leases, which included $2.6 billion of PPP commercial loans originated in 2020. Average commercial loan growth totaled $3.3 billion, or 22.9%. Excluding the PPP loans, commercial loan origination activity remained solid with organic growth in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cleveland, Ohio and Mid-Atlantic (Washington D.C., northern Virginia and Maryland markets) regions. Average consumer loan growth was $57.1 million, or 0.7%, with growth in residential mortgage loans of $338.0 million, or 10.6%, and direct installment loans of $202.6 million, or 11.5%, partially offset by declines in consumer lending heavily impacted by COVID-19 as indirect auto loans decreased $348.1 million, or 17.8%, and consumer lines of credit decreased $135.4 million, or 9.1%. During September 2020, $508 million of indirect auto installment loans were transferred to loans held for sale in anticipation of a loan sale expected to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, average securities decreased $279.1 million, or 4.4%, due to higher loan growth in 2020 and less attractive reinvestment yields. The yield on average interest-earning assets (non-GAAP) decreased 97 basis points from 4.31% for the third quarter of 2019 to 

3.34% for the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the impact on the variable rate loans of significant reductions in 1-month LIBOR and the Prime rate. 

Interest expense of $45.3 million for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $39.3 million, or 46.4%, from the same quarter of 2019, due to a decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities and growth in average non-interest-bearing deposits over the same quarter of 2019. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.8 billion, or 10.3%, and average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 39.7%. The growth in non-interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits was driven by deposits for PPP funding and government stimulus activities, as well as solid organic growth in customer relationships. Average short-term borrowings decreased $1.0 billion, or 31.4%, primarily as a result of a decrease of $1.2 billion in federal funds purchased, partially offset by increases of $78.0 million in short-term FHLB advances and $118.8 million in customer repurchase accounts. Average long-term borrowings increased $188.3 million, or 14.1%, primarily resulting from an increase of $298.2 million in senior debt, partially offset by a decrease of $106.1 million in long-term FHLB advances. The increase in senior debt is due to the February 2020 issuance of $300 million in fixed rate senior notes, while the decrease in long-term FHLB advances is due to the prepayment of higher rate borrowings during the third quarter of 2020. The funding of both fixed and adjustable borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 72 basis points from 1.49% to 0.77% for the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the interest rate actions made by the FOMC and our actions taken to reduce the cost of interest-bearing deposits. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is determined based on management&#8217;s estimates of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses needed to absorb probable life-of-loan losses in the loan and lease portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The following table presents information regarding the credit loss expense and net charge-offs: 

TABLE 6 

Three Months Ended September 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Change Change Provision for credit losses (on loans and leases) $ 27,233 &#160; $ 11,910 $ 15,323 128.7 % Net loan charge-offs 19,256 &#160; 6,430 12,826 199.5 Net loan charge-offs (annualized) / total average loans and leases 0.29 &#160; % 0.11 % 

Provision for credit losses of $27.2 million during the third quarter of 2020 increased 128.7% from the same period of 2019, as we built reserves against COVID-19 impacted businesses, specifically lodging and hotels, restaurants and retail investment real estate. Net loan charge-offs were $19.3 million, an increase of $12.8 million, with the increase primarily due to higher commercial charge-offs taken against credits that were somewhat impacted by COVID-19 during the third quarter. For additional information relating to the allowance and provision for credit losses, refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Non-Interest Income 

The breakdown of non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 7 

Three Months Ended September 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Change Change Service charges $ 24,296 &#160; $ 33,158 $ (8,862) (26.7) % Trust services 7,733 &#160; 6,932 801 11.6 Insurance commissions and fees 6,401 &#160; 6,141 260 4.2 Securities commissions and fees 4,494 &#160; 4,115 379 9.2 Capital markets income 8,202 &#160; 8,713 (511) (5.9) Mortgage banking operations 18,831 &#160; 9,754 9,077 93.1 Dividends on non-marketable equity securities 2,496 &#160; 4,565 (2,069) (45.3) Bank owned life insurance 3,867 &#160; 2,720 1,147 42.2 Net securities gains 112 &#160; 35 77 220.0 Other 3,606 &#160; 3,867 (261) (6.7) Total non-interest income $ 80,038 &#160; $ 80,000 $ 38 &#8212; % 

Total non-interest income was stable at $80.0 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. Excluding significant items, non-interest income increased $3.3 million, or 4.1%. The variances in the individual non-interest income items are explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges on loans and deposits of $24.3 million for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $8.9 million, or 26.7%, from the same period of 2019, partially due to $3.8 million of service charge refunds, combined with lower transaction volumes given COVID-19, although customer transaction volume has started to increase over the last few months. 

Trust services of $7.7 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased $0.8 million, or 11.6%, from the same period of 2019, primarily driven by strong organic revenue production and market valuation impacts. We continued to generate strong organic growth in accounts and services, while the market value of assets under management increased $405.7 million, or 6.7%, to $6.5 billion at September 30, 2020. 

Record mortgage banking operations income of $18.8 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased $9.1 million, or 93.1%, from the same period of 2019, primarily due to increased saleable volume and expanding margins. During the third quarter of 2020, we sold $478.3 million of residential mortgage loans, compared to $416.6 million for the same period of 2019, an increase of 14.8%, excluding the $151.8 million portfolio bulk sale for third quarter of 2019. Additionally, the mortgage banking results included a $0.5 million favorable interest rate-related valuation adjustment on MSRs in the third quarter of 2020 compared to an unfavorable $0.3 million valuation adjustment in the third quarter of 2019. We also recognized $2.8 million of higher MSR amortization due to higher prepayment speeds during the third quarter of 2020. 

Dividends on non-marketable equity securities of $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $2.1 million, or 45.3%, from the same period of 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the FHLB dividend rate and lower levels of FHLB borrowings given the strong growth in deposits. 

BOLI income of $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased $1.1 million, or 42.2%, from the same period of 2019, primarily due to life insurance claims. 

Other non-interest income was $3.6 million and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The third quarter of 2020 included a $13.8 million gain on the sale of Visa class B stock, partially offset by a $4.4 million loss on FHLB debt extinguishment and $8.9 million in related hedge termination costs. 

The following table presents non-interest income excluding significant items for the three months ended September 30, 2019:

Total non-interest expense of $180.2 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased $2.4 million, or 1.4%, from the same period of 2019. Non-interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.1%, when excluding $2.7 million of COVID-19 expenses in the third quarter of 2020. The variances in the individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits of $100.3 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased $6.7 million, or 7.1%, from the same period of 2019, primarily due to higher production-related commissions and the normal impact from annual merit increases. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense of $30.8 million for the third quarter of 2020 increased $2.0 million, or 7.0%, from $28.8 million from the same period of 2019, reflecting expansion in key regions such as the Mid-Atlantic (Washington D.C., northern Virginia and Maryland markets) and South Carolina. 

FDIC insurance of $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $1.6 million, or 28.8%, from the same period of 2019 as deposit growth provided additional liquidity and resulted in a lower FDIC assessment rate. 

Other non-interest expense was $21.2 million and $26.6 million for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded $2.2 million in COVID-19 expenses in other non-interest expense. During the third quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.2 million from a renewable energy investment tax credit transaction. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized during the same quarter as a benefit to income taxes. These 

items were partially offset by decreases in several other items in other non-interest expense, including marketing, business development expenses and miscellaneous losses, which were somewhat impacted by the COVID-19 operating environment. 

The following table presents non-interest expense excluding significant items for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:

Income Taxes 

The following table presents information regarding income tax expense and certain tax rates: 

TABLE 11 

&#160; Three Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Income tax expense $ 16,924 &#160; $ 17,366 Effective tax rate 17.0 &#160; % 14.5 % Statutory federal tax rate 21.0 &#160; 21.0 

Both periods&#8217; tax rates are lower than the federal statutory tax rates of 21% due to tax benefits primarily resulting from tax-exempt income on investments and loans, tax credits and income from BOLI. The lower effective tax rate in 2019 is due to the impact from renewable energy investment tax credits realized in the third quarter of 2019. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 

Net income available to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2020 was $100.7 million or $0.64 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2019 of $286.0 million or $0.88 per diluted common share. Non-interest income totaled $226.2 million, increasing $6.0 million, or 2.7%. On an operating basis, non-interest income increased $7.5 million, or 3.4%, primarily attributable to the fee-based businesses of mortgage banking and capital markets. Significant items during the first nine months of 2020 included a loss on FHLB debt extinguishment and related hedge termination costs of $13.3 million and a $13.8 million gain on the sale of the Bank's holdings of Visa Class B shares and were both recorded in other non-interest income. Additionally, we recorded $3.8 million of service charge refunds. Non-interest expense totaled $551.0 million, increasing $32.3 million, or 6.2%. Excluding significant items totaling $14.9 million year-to-date in 2020 and $2.8 million for the same period in 2019, non-interest expense increased $20.2 million, or 3.9%. Significant items in non-interest expense for the first nine months of 2020 included branch consolidation costs of $8.3 million and COVID-19 expense of $6.6 million.

(2) The interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The yield on earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

(3) Average balances include non-accrual loans. Loans and leases consist of average total loans less average unearned income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income totaled $687.7 million, decreasing $3.1 million, or 0.5%. Lower interest rates contributed to this decline as 1-month LIBOR averaged 0.66% for the first nine months of 2020, compared to 1.54% in the same period of 2019. Partially offsetting this decline was 8.7% growth in interest-earning assets. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) declined 28 basis points to 2.93%. 

The following table provides certain information regarding changes in net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) attributable to changes in the average volumes and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average volume and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019:

(1) The amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes. 

(2) Interest income amounts are reflected on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) of $868.9 million for the first nine months of 2020, decreased $82.7 million, or 8.7%, from the same period of 2019, resulting from the decrease in benchmark interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest-earning assets of $2.5 billion. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily driven by a $2.4 billion, or 10.8%, increase in average total loans due to PPP activity and solid origination activity across the footprint. Average commercial loan growth totaled $2.3 billion, or 16.5%, including growth of $1.6 billion, or 33.2%, in commercial and industrial loans. Commercial loan growth was led by strong commercial activity in the Pittsburgh, Cleveland, South Carolina, and Mid-Atlantic regions. Average consumer loan growth of $93.7 million, or 1.1%, was led by increases in residential mortgage loans of $256.2 million, or 8.0%, and direct installment balances of $155.2 million, or 8.9%, partially offset by a decline of $131.7 million, or 8.6%, in consumer credit lines and $186.1 million, or 9.5%, in indirect auto installment loans. Additionally, the net reduction in the securities portfolio was a result of management's strategy to deploy excess liquidity into higher yielding loans, as average securities decreased $209.2 million, or 3.3%, given historically low and unattractive interest rates. For the first nine months of 2020, the yield on average interest-earning assets (non-GAAP) decreased 70 basis points to 3.65%, compared to the first nine months of 2019, primarily due the lower interest rate environment. 

Interest expense of $171.7 million for the first nine months of 2020 decreased $78.4 million, or 31.4%, from the same period of 2019 primarily due to a decrease in rates paid, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 7.5%, which reflects the benefit of organic growth, as well as deposits for PPP funding and government stimulus activities. Average long-term borrowings increased $508.4 million, or 49.4%, primarily due to increases of $274.1 million in long-term FHLB borrowings and $239.5 million in senior debt. The 

funding of both fixed and adjustable longer-term borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth. During the third quarter of 2020, we terminated $415 million of higher-rate FHLB borrowings. During the first quarter of 2020, we issued $300 million of 2.20% fixed rate senior notes due in 2023. During the first quarter of 2019, we issued $120.0 million of 4.950% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2029. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 50 basis points to 0.98% for the first nine months of 2020, compared to the first nine months of 2019 due to reduced costs on interest-bearing deposits and lower borrowing costs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The following table presents information regarding the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs: 

TABLE 16 

Nine Months Ended September 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Change Change Provision for credit losses (on loans and leases) $ 105,238 &#160; $ 37,017 $ 68,221 184.3 % Net loan charge-offs 33,428 &#160; 23,029 10,399 45.2 Net loan charge-offs (annualized) / total average loans and leases 0.18 &#160; % 0.14 % 

Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $105.2 million, an increase of $68.2 million from the year-ago quarter, and reflected CECL and COVID-19 related provision in the first nine months of 2020. Net charge-offs were $33.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $23.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Non-Interest Income 

The breakdown of non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 is presented in the following table: 

TABLE 17 

Nine Months Ended September 30, $ % (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Change Change Service charges $ 78,362 &#160; $ 95,443 $ (17,081) (17.9) % Trust services 23,045 &#160; 20,734 2,311 11.1 Insurance commissions and fees 18,788 &#160; 15,449 3,339 21.6 Securities commissions and fees 12,796 &#160; 13,131 (335) (2.6) Capital markets income 31,830 &#160; 24,616 7,214 29.3 Mortgage banking operations 34,348 &#160; 21,272 13,076 61.5 Dividends on non-marketable equity securities 9,940 &#160; 13,723 (3,783) (27.6) Bank owned life insurance 10,968 &#160; 8,664 2,304 26.6 Net securities gains 262 &#160; 35 227 648.6 Other 5,853 &#160; 7,158 (1,305) (18.2) Total non-interest income $ 226,192 &#160; $ 220,225 $ 5,967 2.7 % 

Total non-interest income increased $6.0 million, to $226.2 million for the first nine months of 2020, a 2.7% increase from the same period of 2019. Excluding significant items, non-interest income increased $7.5 million, or 3.4%. The variances in significant individual non-interest income items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Service charges on loans and deposits of $78.4 million for the first nine months of 2020 decreased $17.1 million, or 17.9%, as there were noticeably lower customer transaction volumes in the COVID-19 environment, although volumes have steadily increased since late in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2020, we recorded $3.8 million of service charge refunds. 

Trust services of $23.0 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $2.3 million, or 11.1%, from the same period of 2019, primarily driven by strong organic revenue production, and the market value of assets under management increased $405.7 million, or 6.7%, to $6.5 billion at September 30, 2020. 

Insurance commissions and fees of $18.8 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $3.3 million, or 21.6%, from the same period of 2019, primarily due to new business in the Carolina regions of our footprint, as well as organic growth in commercial lines. 

Capital markets income of $31.8 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $7.2 million, or 29.3%, from $24.6 million for the same period of 2019, reflecting strong relationships with new and existing commercial customers. 

Mortgage banking operations income of $34.3 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $13.1 million, or 61.5%, from the same period of 2019, due to increased saleable volume and meaningfully expanding margins. During the first nine months of 2020, we sold $1.2 billion of residential mortgage loans, a 24.4% increase compared to $0.9 billion, excluding the $110.1 million and $151.8 million portfolio bulk sales, for the same period of 2019. The higher origination and secondary marketing revenues were partially offset by $4.6 million higher MSR impairment related to unfavorable interest-rate valuation adjustments and $7.5 million of higher MSR amortization due to higher prepayment speeds. 

Dividends on equity securities of $9.9 million for the first nine months of 2020 decreased $3.8 million, or 27.6%, from the same period of 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the FHLB dividend rate and lower levels of FHLB borrowings given the strong growth in deposits. 

Income from BOLI of $11.0 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $2.3 million, or 26.6%, primarily due to life insurance claims. 

Other non-interest income was $5.9 million and $7.2 million for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The first nine months of 2020 included a $13.8 million gain on the sale of Visa class B stock, partially offset by a $4.4 million loss on FHLB debt extinguishment and $8.9 million in related hedge termination costs. During the first nine months of 2019, we recognized $1.9 million in net gains on Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) investments, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million for the first nine months of 2020.

Total non-interest expense of $551.0 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $32.3 million, an 6.2% increase from the same period of 2019. Non-interest expense increased $20.2 million, or 3.9%, when excluding significant items, including $6.6 million of expenses associated with COVID-19, $8.3 million of branch consolidation costs, and $5.6 million of retirement vesting changes for certain 2020 stock awards, compared to $2.8 million of branch consolidation costs in the first nine months of 2019. The variances in the individual non-interest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs. 

Salaries and employee benefits of $298.1 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $18.9 million or 6.8% from the same period of 2019, primarily related to production-related commissions, normal merit increases and stock-based compensation. We made a change to long-term stock-based compensation retirement vesting that resulted in accelerated grant date expense recognition for certain 2020 awards, with full expense recognition on grant date instead of recognizing the same expense amount over a 36-month vesting period. These awards are not released until the three-year service period is complete or the specified performance criteria is met over the three-year period. Additionally, we recorded $1.5 million relating to COVID-19 expenses. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense of $97.5 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $7.8 million, or 8.7%, from $89.8 million from the same period of 2019, primarily due to $8.3 million of branch consolidation costs, compared to $2.2 million in the first nine months of 2019. 

Outside services expense of $50.6 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $3.9 million, or 8.2%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to increases in data processing costs. 

FDIC insurance expense of $15.0 million for the first nine months of 2020 decreased $2.7 million, or 15.2%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to increased subordinated debt at FNBPA and improved liquidity metrics. 

Bank shares and franchise taxes of $11.9 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased $1.8 million, or 17.3%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to the 2020 capital base increase and higher tax credits in 2019. 

Other non-interest expense was $67.9 million and $64.7 million for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the first nine months of 2020, we recorded $2.3 million more in unfunded loan commitment expenses, compared to the same period of 2019. The first nine months of 2020 also included $4.3 million in COVID-19-related expenses. The COVID-19 related expenses included a $1.0 million contribution to our foundation for relief assistance to our communities, benefiting food banks and providing funding for essential medical supplies. These items were partially offset by decreases in several other items in other non-interest expense, including marketing and business development expenses, which were somewhat impacted by the COVID-19 operating environment.

Both periods&#8217; tax rates are lower than the federal statutory tax rates of 21% due to tax benefits primarily resulting from tax-exempt income on investments and loans, tax credits and income from BOLI. The lower effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower pretax income levels in a COVID-19 environment.

Lending Activity 

The loan and lease portfolio consists principally of loans and leases to individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses within our primary markets in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. During 2020, we originated $2.6 billion of PPP loans. Additionally, during September, 2020, $508 million of indirect installment loans were transferred to loans held for sale in anticipation of a loan sale expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Following is a summary of loans and leases:

Non-Performing Assets 

Following is a summary of non-performing assets:

Non-performing assets increased $69.5 million, from $128.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $198.1 million at September 30, 2020. This reflects an increase of $74.8 million in non-performing loans and leases and a decrease of $5.3 million in OREO. Prior to the adoption of CECL, acquired PCD loans were excluded from our non-performing disclosures. PCD loans that meet the definition of non-accrual are now included in the disclosures and resulted in a $54 million CECL adoption Day 1 increase in non-accrual loans compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease in OREO was largely driven by the sale of multiple pieces of real estate. 

During the first half of 2020, we saw significant macroeconomic changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stay-at-home orders and non-essential business closures in many of our markets temporarily suspended the income generation of some of our borrowers. Government stimulus and support programs generated through the CARES Act, such as the PPP, began to assist our borrowers through the difficult financial disruptions. We continued to offer these programs during the third quarter of 2020. We offered short-term modifications to our customers to assist them through this period. The programs our customers have taken advantage of are: 

&#8226; Existing customers who were current prior to the start of the pandemic, can elect to defer loan principal and interest payments or interest payments for up to 90 days without late fees but will continue to accrue interest. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 6,000 commercial customers have elected this option. 

&#8226; Mortgage and consumer loan customers have up to a 90-day payment deferral option, depending on their loan type. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 9,100 of these customers have elected this option. 

&#8226; SBA disaster relief assistance, including the PPP. 

The loan deferral programs can be extended on an individual basis. Most of the deferrals for our borrowers expired in July 2020. Second deferrals totaled $464 million at September 30, 2020. We had approximately $792 million, or 3.4%, of total loans and leases (excluding PPP loans), which included second deferrals previously mentioned. 

As long as the borrower was not experiencing financial difficulties immediately prior to COVID-19, short-term modifications, such as principal and interest deferments, are not being included in TDRs. These modifications will be closely monitored for any future deterioration and included in the tables as the probability of collection deteriorates.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL which changed how we calculate the ACL as more fully described in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). This expected credit loss model takes into consideration the expected losses over the life of the loan at the time the loan is originated compared to the incurred loss model under the prior standard. At the time of the adoption, we recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment of $50.6 million as a reduction to Retained Earnings. The ACL balance increased by $105 million and included a &#8220;gross-up" to PCD loan balances and the ACL of $50 million. Included in the CECL adoption impact was an increase of $10 million to our AULC. The model used to calculate the ACL is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality, as well as historical experience, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates. Specifically, the following considerations are incorporated into the ACL calculation: 

&#8226; a third-party macroeconomic forecast scenario; 

&#8226; a 24-month R&#38;S forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period; and 

&#8226; the historical through the cycle mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period. 

COVID-19 Impacts 

Starting in March 2020, the broader economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables utilized in our ACL modeling process. Based on these changes, we are utilizing a third-party pandemic recessionary macroeconomic forecast scenario for ACL modeling purposes. This scenario captures forecasted macroeconomic variables as of mid-September to ensure our ACL calculation considers the most recently available macroeconomic data in a quickly evolving environment at quarter-end. Macroeconomic variables that we utilized from this scenario include but are not limited to: (i) gross domestic product, which reflects a contraction of up to 7% from the beginning of 2020 with average annual increases not occurring until 

mid-2021, (ii) the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which remains below peak levels throughout the R&#38;S period, (iii) unemployment, which averages 10% over the R&#38;S period and (iv) the Volatility Index, which remains elevated in the fourth quarter of 2020 before declining to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2021. 

The ACL of $373.0 million at September 30, 2020 increased $177.1 million, or 90.4%, from December 31, 2019 and reflects the immediate Day 1 CECL adoption increase to the ACL of $105.3 million on January 1, 2020. Our ending ACL coverage ratio at September 30, 2020 was 1.45%. Excluding PPP loans that do not carry an ACL due to a 100% government guarantee, the ACL to total loan and leases ratio equaled 1.61%, or an impact of 16 basis points. Total provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $105.2 million. Net charge-offs were $33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, with the increase primarily due to higher commercial charge-offs taken against credits that were somewhat impacted by COVID-19 during the third quarter. The ACL as a percentage of non-performing loans for the total portfolio increased from 190% as of December 31, 2019 to 210% as of September 30, 2020, as provision exceeded net charge-offs and included ACL reserve build, while the level of non-performing loans increased. 

Deposits 

As a bank holding company, our primary source of funds is deposits. These deposits are provided by businesses, municipalities and individuals located within the markets served by our Community Banking subsidiary. 

Following is a summary of deposits: 

TABLE 26 

(in millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 $ Change % Change Non-interest-bearing demand $ 8,741 &#160; $ 6,384 $ 2,357 36.9 % Interest-bearing demand 13,063 &#160; 11,049 2,014 18.2 Savings 3,007 &#160; 2,625 382 14.6 Certificates and other time deposits 4,025 &#160; 4,728 (703) (14.9) Total deposits $ 28,836 &#160; $ 24,786 $ 4,050 16.3 % 

Total deposits increased $4.1 billion, or 16.3%, from December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of growth in transaction deposits (including non-interest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand and savings) that reflects the inflow of funds from the PPP and government stimulus activity, in addition to organic growth in customer relationships. This growth was partially offset by a managed decline of $703.0 million, or 14.9%, in time deposits. Generating growth in relationship-based transaction deposits remains a key focus for us and will help us manage to lower levels of short-term borrowings. 

Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters 

The access to, and cost of, funding for new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. 

The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions, regulatory changes or actions, and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence. 

We have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Pursuant to this registration statement, we may, from time to time, issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts or units. On February 24, 2020, we completed an offering of $300.0 million of 2.20% fixed rate senior notes due in 2023 under this registration statement. The net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $297.9 million. We will use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, which may include investments at the holding company level, capital to support the growth of FNBPA, repurchase of our common shares and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness. 

On February 14, 2019, we completed an offering of $120.0 million of 4.950% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2029 under this registration statement. The subordinated notes are treated as tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The 

net proceeds of this debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $118.2 million. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the subordinated notes to redeem higher-rate long-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes. 

On September 23, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $150 million of our common stock. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time. There were no repurchases made during the third quarter of 2020. 

Capital management is a continuous process, with capital plans and stress testing for FNB and FNBPA updated at least annually. These capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of 2-3 years beyond the current year. From time to time, we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans. We may issue additional preferred or common stock in order to maintain our well-capitalized status. 

FNB and FNBPA are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies (see discussion under &#8220;Enhanced Regulatory Capital Standards&#8221;). Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require FNB and FNBPA to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, tier 1 and common equity tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and minimum leverage ratio (as defined). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions, by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, dividends and future business and corporate strategies. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, FNB and FNBPA must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. FNB&#8217;s and FNBPA&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

At September 30, 2020, the capital levels of both FNB and FNBPA exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. 

In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing BHCs and banks, including FNB, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL over a three-year period. In March 2020, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that became effective on March 31, 2020, and that provides BHCs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the estimate of the impact of CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology for estimating the ACL, on regulatory capital. We have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. As a result, under the interim final rule, we will delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Under the interim final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire day-one impact at adoption plus 25% of the subsequent change in the ACL during the two-year deferral period. During the third quarter of 2020, the total deferred impact on Common Equity Tier 1 capital related to our adoption of CECL was approximately $68.4 million, or 25 basis points. 

In this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment, we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations, including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions similar to the current conditions. Under these scenarios, the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels, demonstrating our expected ability to continue to support our constituencies under stressful financial conditions. 

Following are the capital amounts and related ratios for FNB and FNBPA:

In accordance with Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital requirements plus capital conservation buffer, which are presented for each period above, represent the minimum requirements needed to avoid limitations on distributions of dividends and certain discretionary bonus payments. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) 

The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight, creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Supervision and Regulation&#8221; included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and amendments to such previously promulgated rules, thereby making it difficult to anticipate with certainty the impact to us or the financial services industry resulting from this rulemaking process. 

LIQUIDITY 

Our goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of FNB with cost-effective funding. Our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with long-term goals, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk, a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; Balance Sheet and adequate levels of liquidity. Our Board of Directors has also established Liquidity and Contingency Funding Policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify, measure, monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions. These policies designate our Asset/Liability Committee as the body responsible for meeting these objectives. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect Balance Sheet or cash flow positions. Liquidity is centrally managed daily by our Treasury Department. 

FNBPA generates liquidity from its normal business operations. Liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments, as well as the ability to securitize, pledge or sell loans, investment securities and other assets. Liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of FNBPA in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements. FNB also has access to reliable and cost-effective wholesale sources of liquidity. Short- and long-term funds are used to help fund normal business operations, and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we would be faced with a liquidity crisis. 

The principal sources of the parent company&#8217;s liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. These dividends may be impacted by the parent&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; capital needs, statutory laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions, profitability and other factors. In addition, through one of our subsidiaries, we regularly issue subordinated notes, which are guaranteed by FNB. Management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parent's funding needs. On February 24, 2020, we completed a senior debt offering whereby we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.20% senior notes due in 2023. The proceeds from this transaction were used for general corporate purposes and were the primary factor resulting in an increase in our Months of Cash on Hand (MCH) liquidity metric as shown below. 

Starting in March 2020, management incorporated potential liquidity impacts related to COVID-19 into our daily analysis. Management concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment. Two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent company&#8217;s cash position are the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and MCH. The LCR is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next 12 months divided by projected cash outflows over the next 12 months. The MCH is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand. 

The LCR and MCH ratios are presented in the following table: 

TABLE 28 

September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Internal limit Liquidity coverage ratio 2.6 times 2.2 times &#62; 1 time Months of cash on hand 19.0 months 15.2 months &#62; 12 months 

Our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationship-based accounts. Organic growth in low-cost transaction deposits was complemented by management&#8217;s strategy of heightened deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers, in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities. Total deposits were $28.8 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 21.8% annualized, from December 31, 2019. Total non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts grew by $2.4 billion, or 49.3% annualized, and interest-bearing demand increased by $2.0 billion, or 24.4% annualized. Savings account balances increased $381.7 million, or 19.4% annualized. Time deposits declined $703.2 million, or 19.9% annualized. As mentioned earlier, inflows from PPP and government stimulus checks were a significant factor in the deposit growth during the second quarter. 

FNBPA has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the FHLB, the FRB, correspondent bank lines, access to brokered deposits, the PPPLF and multiple other channels. In addition to credit availability, FNBPA also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs. We currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements. The ALCO is currently targeting a 1% guideline 

level for salable unpledged government and agency securities due to an elevated influx of public fund related deposits, in part related to the PPP, combined with a strategic decline in the investment portfolio. 

The following table presents certain information relating to FNBPA&#8217;s credit availability and salable unpledged securities: 

TABLE 29 

(dollars in millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Unused wholesale credit availability $ 16,410 &#160; $ 11,154 Unused wholesale credit availability as a % of FNBPA assets 43.9 &#160; % 32.3 % Salable unpledged government and agency securities $ 250 &#160; $ 1,788 Salable unpledged government and agency securities as a % of FNBPA assets 0.7 &#160; % 5.2 % 

The PPPLF accounted for $2.5 billion of the increase in availability since December 31, 2019. This funding source has been extended to December 31, 2020. We also had $218.5 million in excess cash to meet our pledging requirements. 

Another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis. The following liquidity gap analysis as of September 30, 2020 compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over future time intervals. Management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business. A reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis. The twelve-month cumulative gap to total assets ratio was 5.2% as of September 30, 2020 compared to (0.3)% as of December 31, 2019. Management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by ALCO.

In addition, the ALCO regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position. The stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions. Management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit-taking activities as a financial intermediary. To succeed in this capacity, we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers. These products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another. For example, depositors may want short-term deposits, while borrowers may desire long-term loans. 

Changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments, cash flows and net interest income. Subject to its ongoing oversight, the Board of Directors has given ALCO the responsibility for market risk management, which involves devising policy guidelines, risk measures and limits, and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. We use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. 

Interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios. Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indexes, which do not always change by the same amount. Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered. Options risk arises from &#8220;embedded options&#8221; within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans, which may be with or without penalty, when rates fall, while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early, which may be with or without penalty, when rates rise. 

We use an asset/liability model to measure our interest rate risk. Interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation, EVE and gap analysis. Gap analysis and EVE are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business. Gap analysis, while a helpful diagnostic tool, displays cash flows for only a single rate environment. EVE&#8217;s long-term horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longer-term positions. However, EVE&#8217;s liquidation perspective does not translate into the earnings-based measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern. Net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest. In these simulations, our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios. The ALCO reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis. Reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile, which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies. 

The following repricing gap analysis as of September 30, 2020 compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time. Management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and EVE risk measures. 

TABLE 31 

(dollars in millions) Within 1 Month 2-3 Months 4-6 Months 7-12 Months Total 1 Year Assets Loans $ 11,514 $ 1,556 $ 1,240 $ 2,307 $ 16,617 Investments 739 441 455 727 2,362 12,253 1,997 1,695 3,034 18,979 Liabilities Non-maturity deposits 8,935 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 8,935 Time deposits 453 675 863 950 2,941 Borrowings 1,409 857 10 21 2,297 10,797 1,532 873 971 14,173 Off-balance sheet 300 730 (50) (100) 880 Period Gap (assets &#8211; liabilities + off-balance sheet) $ 1,756 $ 1,195 $ 772 $ 1,963 $ 5,686 Cumulative Gap $ 1,756 $ 2,951 $ 3,723 $ 5,686 Cumulative Gap to Assets 5.3 % 9.0 % 11.3 % 17.3 % 

The twelve-month cumulative repricing gap to total assets was 17.3% and 7.0% as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interest-bearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months. If interest rates increase as modeled, net interest income will increase and, conversely, if interest rates decrease as modeled, net interest income will decrease. The change in the cumulative repricing gap at September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, is primarily related to growth and changes in the mix of loans, deposits and borrowings. Strong commercial and industrial loan growth, a portion of which was swapped to adjustable rates and the increased cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios, were partially offset by growth in and repricing of certain interest-bearing non-maturity deposit balances and the funding of FHLB advances. The funding and 

redemption of both fixed and adjustable borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth. 

The allocation of non-maturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the one-month maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates. For example, if a product&#8217;s rate is estimated to increase by 50% as much as the market rates, then 50% of the account balance was placed in this category. 

Utilizing net interest income simulations, the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion. The variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and EVE calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and EVE that was calculated assuming market rates as of September 30, 2020. Using a static Balance Sheet structure, the measures do not reflect all of management's potential counteractions. 

The following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and EVE to changes in interest rates using rate shocks: 

TABLE 32 

September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 ALCO Limits Net interest income change (12 months): + 300 basis points 17.1 &#160; % 6.5 % n/a + 200 basis points 11.5 &#160; 4.6 (5.0) % + 100 basis points 5.7 &#160; 2.5 (5.0) - 100 basis points (0.3) (4.1) (5.0) Economic value of equity: + 300 basis points 8.5 &#160; (2.0) (25.0) + 200 basis points 7.0 &#160; (0.5) (15.0) + 100 basis points 4.5 &#160; 0.2 (10.0) - 100 basis points (8.3) (3.8) (10.0) 

We also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months (Rate Ramps) and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve. Assuming a static Balance Sheet, a +100 basis point Rate Ramp increases net interest income (12 months) by 2.8% at September 30, 2020 and 1.5% at December 31, 2019. The corresponding metrics for a -100 basis point Rate Ramp are (0.1)% and (2.0)% at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The FRB's rapid and large downward interest rate moves in March 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic lowered all market interest rates, specifically 1-month LIBOR. Thirty-six percent of our loans are indexed to LIBOR. Further, the yield curve flattened. These factors were the primary drivers of the decrease in base net interest income. Of this lower base net interest income, floors that are embedded in a portion of our loan portfolio contributed to the net interest income sensitivity. In this historically low rate environment, our strategy is to remain slightly asset sensitive. 

There are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact Net Interest Income. These include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates, as well as internal factors regarding product offerings, product mix and pricing of loans and deposits. 

Management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk (IRR) position. In response to the change in interest rates, management was proactive in addressing our IRR position. As mentioned earlier, we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest rate-sensitive than short-term time deposits and wholesale borrowings. Also, we were able to lower rates on deposit products and shorten the term of the certificates of deposit volumes. This continues to be an intense focus of management. Further, during the first nine months of 2020, management took advantage of the interest rate environment to reduce borrowing costs. On the lending side, we regularly sell long-term fixed-rate residential mortgages to the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with short-term repricing characteristics. In particular, we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers (commercial swaps) to manage our IRR position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustable-rate loans. Total variable and adjustable-rate loans were 53.5% and 59.1% of total loans as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, with 79.2% of these loans, or 42.4% of total loans, tied to the Prime or one-month LIBOR rates. As of 

September 30, 2020, the commercial swaps totaled $4.6 billion of notional principal, with $1.2 million in original notional swap principal originated during the first nine months of 2020. For additional information regarding interest rate swaps, see Note 11 in this Report. The investment portfolio is also used, in part, to manage our IRR position. These purchases are predominately fixed rate in nature in which we seek to minimize prepayment risk. 

We recognize that all asset/liability models have some inherent shortcomings. Asset/liability models require certain assumptions to be made, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and repricing impact on non-maturity deposits, which may differ from actual experience. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans, economic and market trends and available industry data. While management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable, there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved. Furthermore, the metrics are based upon the Balance Sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

As a financial institution, we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision, transaction and activity. Our Board of Directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk and strategic risk. In its oversight role of our risk management function, the Board of Directors focuses on the strategies, analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying, understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total stockholder value, while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations. 

The Board of Directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns. As such, the board monitors a series of KRIs, or Key Risk Indicators, for various business lines, operational units, and risk categories, providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite. These results are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement, and where appropriate, adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks. 

We support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our Board of Directors and senior management. The joint Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the FNBPA Board of Directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances. The Risk Committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following: 

&#8226; identification, measurement, assessment and monitoring of enterprise-wide risk; 

&#8226; development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies; 

&#8226; review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory and operating risk (including technology, operational, compliance and fiduciary risks); and 

&#8226; identification and implementation of risk management best practices. 

The Risk Committee serves as the primary point of contact between our Board of Directors and the Risk Management Council, which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management. Risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our Board Risk Committee and Risk Management Council. We use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance tactics, while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Our top-down risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risk-taking for bottom-up planning from our various business functions. Our Board Risk Committee, in collaboration with our Risk Management Council, approves our risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently, as needed to reflect changes in the risk, regulatory, economic and strategic plan environments, with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations, regulatory environment and our shareholders' expectations. Reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans, and our ongoing monitoring thereof, are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our Board Risk Committee. 

As noted above, we have a Risk Management Council comprised of senior management. The purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. Management has also established an Operational Risk Committee that is responsible for identifying, evaluating and monitoring operational 

risks across FNB, evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the Risk Management Council. The Risk Management Council reports on a regular basis to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors regarding our enterprise-wide risk profile and other significant risk management issues. Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas, including the following departments: Enterprise-Wide Risk Management, Fraud Risk, Loan Review, Model Risk Management, Third-Party Risk Management, Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Appraisal Review, Compliance and Information and Cyber Security. All second line of defense departments report to the Chief Risk Officer to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a day-to-day basis. Our Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Department conducts risk and control assessments across all of our business and operational areas to ensure the appropriate risk identification, risk management and reporting of risks enterprise-wide. The Fraud Risk Department monitors for internal and external fraud risk across all of our business and operational units. The Loan Review Department conducts independent testing of our loan risk ratings to ensure their accuracy, which is instrumental to calculating our ACL. Our Model Risk Management Department oversees validation and testing of all models used in managing risk across our company. Our Third-Party Risk Management Department ensures effective risk management and oversight of third-party relationships throughout the vendor life cycle. The Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act Department monitors for compliance with money laundering risk and associated regulatory compliance requirements. Our Community Reinvestment Department monitors for compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The Appraisal Review Department facilitates independent ordering and review of real estate appraisals obtained for determining the value of real estate pledged as collateral for loans to customers. Our Compliance Department is responsible for developing policies and procedures and monitoring compliance with applicable laws and regulations which govern our business operations. Our Information and Cyber Security Department is responsible for maintaining a risk assessment of our information and cyber security risks and ensuring appropriate controls are in place to manage and control such risks, through the use of the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework for improving critical infrastructure by measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of information and cyber security controls. As discussed in more detail under the COVID-19 section of this Report, we have in place various business and emergency continuity plans to respond to different crises and circumstances which include rapid deployment of our Crisis Management Team, Incident Management Team and Business Continuity Coordinators to activate the our plans for various type of emergency circumstance. Further, our audit function performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our Audit Committee. Each of the Risk, Audit and Credit Risk and CRA Committees of our Board of Directors regularly report on risk-related matters to the full Board of Directors. In addition, both the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and our Risk Management Council regularly assess our enterprise-wide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues. 

The Board of Directors believes that our enterprise-wide risk management process is effective and enables the Board of Directors to: 

&#8226; assess the quality of the information they receive; 

&#8226; understand the businesses, investments and financial, accounting, legal, regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that FNB faces; 

&#8226; oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk; and 

&#8226; assess appropriately the quality of our enterprise-wide risk management process. 

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO GAAP 

Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures and key performance indicators discussed in this Report to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the following tables.

The table above shows how operating net income available to common stockholders (non-GAAP) is derived from amounts reported in our financial statements. We believe certain charges, such as branch consolidation costs, service charge refunds and COVID-19 expense, are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. The branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us. These costs are specific to each individual transaction, and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. Similarly, gains derived from the sale of Visa class B stock and losses on FHLB debt extinguishment and related hedge terminations are not organic to our operations. The COVID-19 expenses represent special Company initiatives to support our front-line employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic.
