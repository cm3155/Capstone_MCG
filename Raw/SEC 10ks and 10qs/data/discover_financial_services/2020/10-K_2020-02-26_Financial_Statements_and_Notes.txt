Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Discover Financial Services (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of financial condition, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 , of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2020 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 

Discover Financial Services 

Riverwoods, IL 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Discover Financial Services (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2020 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Credit Card Loan Losses &#8212; Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Company originates unsecured credit card loans. At December 31, 2019, these loans totaled $77 billion . The Company estimates and records an allowance for credit card loans that are impaired on a pool basis using credit loss models that incorporate historical loss data, current portfolio characteristics, and other qualitative factors. There was a significant amount of judgment required by management in selecting model inputs and in analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the recorded allowance. 

Auditing the credit loss models and related inputs used to determine the allowance involved especially subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of evidence provided and required significant effort, including the use of credit modeling specialists. 

- 72 - 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the allowance for credit card loan losses balance included the following procedures, among others: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the allowance for loan losses including controls over data integrity and model assumptions. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the historical borrower data, including collection data, bankruptcy statistics, portfolio characteristics, and other data used in management&#8217;s models. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We used our credit modeling specialists to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the allowance. We also evaluated the reasonableness of the economic assumptions used in the models by comparing such assumptions to independent sources. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We evaluated the model results considering economic conditions, including recent trends in national credit card loan delinquencies and charge-offs data, and performed a peer analysis to evaluate the trends in the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses over time and as compared to its peers. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We assessed the reasonableness of the model results by comparing modeled losses to actual historical losses. 

##TABLE_END Disclosure of Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13 Adoption &#8212; Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, which introduces a forward-looking &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model (the &#8220;Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)&#8221; model) to estimate credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. Estimates of expected credit losses under the CECL model are based on relevant information about current conditions, historical experiences and reasonable and supportable forward-looking forecasts regarding collectability of the loan portfolio. 

In order to estimate the expected credit losses, new credit loss models were implemented to align with the CECL model. Assumptions used to estimate expected credit losses under the CECL model included but were not limited to key economic assumptions applied over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, and for the credit card portfolio the application of a credit card payment allocation policy. The Company disclosed that the impact of adoption on January 1, 2020 will result in an increase of $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, an increase of $0.6 billion to other assets and a $1.9 billion decrease in retained earnings. 

Given the estimation of credit losses significantly changes under the CECL model, including the application of new accounting policies, the use of new subjective judgments, and changes made to the loss estimation models, performing audit procedures to evaluate the disclosure of ASU 2016-13 adoption involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the disclosure of ASU 2016-13 adoption included the following procedures, among others: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the CECL estimate including controls over data integrity, model assumptions and model validation. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We evaluated the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, methodologies, and elections involved in the adoption of the CECL model. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the historical borrower data, including collection data, bankruptcy statistics, portfolio characteristics, and other data used in management&#8217;s models. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We used our credit modeling specialists to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the CECL estimate and examine logic for selected components of the model. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We also evaluated the reasonableness of the economic assumptions used in the models by comparing such assumptions to independent sources. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We evaluated the reasonable and supportable forecast period over which the key economic assumptions are applied, by reviewing the historical accuracy of economic forecasts and other underlying economic information management used as the basis for the selected reasonable and supportable period. 

##TABLE_END

- 73 - 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

For the credit card loan portfolio, we evaluated the assumption of how expected credit card payments are applied to existing credit card balances to determine if it is reasonable and consistent with the CECL standard. We used our credit modeling specialists to evaluate if the approach was consistently applied in the model in accordance with the Company&#8217;s selected policy. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We evaluated the completeness of the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to adoption of ASU 2016-13.

##TABLE_START 1. 

Background and Basis of Presentation 

##TABLE_END Description of Business 

Discover Financial Services (&#8220;DFS&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a direct banking and payment services company. The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as well as a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and therefore is subject to oversight, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Company provides direct banking products and services and payment services through its subsidiaries. The Company offers its customers credit card loans, private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans and deposit products. The Company also operates the Discover Network, the PULSE network (&#8220;PULSE&#8221;) and Diners Club International (&#8220;Diners Club&#8221;). The Discover Network processes transactions for Discover-branded credit and debit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally, as well as merchant acceptance throughout the U.S. for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. 

The Company&#8217;s business activities are managed in two segments, Direct Banking and Payment Services, based on the products and services provided. For a detailed description of the operations of each segment, as well as the allocation conventions used in business segment reporting, see Note 22: Segment Disclosures. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company&#8217;s policy is to consolidate all entities in which it owns more than 50 % of the outstanding voting stock unless it does not control the entity. However, the Company did not have a controlling voting interest in any entity other than its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

It is also the Company&#8217;s policy to consolidate any VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as defined by GAAP. On this basis, the Company consolidates the Discover Card Master Trust I (&#8220;DCMT&#8221;) and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (&#8220;DCENT&#8221;) as well as two student loan securitization trusts. The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each of these trusts since it is, for each, the trust servicer and the holder of both the residual interest and the majority of the most subordinated interests. Because of those involvements, the Company has, for each trust, (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust and (ii) the obligation (or right) to absorb losses (or receive benefits) of the trust that could potentially be significant. The Company has determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any other VIE during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . 

For investments in any entities in which the Company owns 50 % or less of the outstanding voting stock but in which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, the Company applies the equity method of accounting. The Company also applies the equity method to its investments in qualified affordable housing projects and similar tax credit partnerships. In cases where the Company&#8217;s equity investment is less than 20 % and significant influence does not exist, such investments are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment in value. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Not Yet Adopted) 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The FASB also issued subsequent ASUs that clarify the scope and provide additional guidance. This ASU replaces the incurred loss model with the current expected credit loss (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) approach. For loans carried at amortized cost, the 

- 80 - 

allowance for loan losses will be based on management&#8217;s current estimate of all expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loans. Upon the origination of a loan, the Company will record its estimate of all expected credit losses on that loan through an immediate charge to earnings. Updates to that estimate each period will be recorded through provision expense. The CECL estimate is to be based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

The CECL approach is expected to increase the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses as a result of: (1) recording reserves for expected losses, not simply those deemed to be already incurred, (2) extending the loss estimate period over the entire life of the loan and (3) presenting the credit loss component of the purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loan portfolio in the allowance for loan losses rather than embedding it within the loan carrying value. The allowance for loan losses on all loans carried at amortized cost, including loans previously referred to as PCI loans and loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) will be measured under the CECL approach. Previous specialized measurement guidance for PCI loans, which the ASU refers to as purchased credit-deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;), and TDRs will be eliminated, although certain separate disclosure guidance will be retained. 

Measurement of credit impairment of available-for-sale debt securities will generally remain unchanged under the new rules, but any credit impairment will be recorded through an allowance, rather than a direct write-down of the security. The Company invests in U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies, which have long histories with no credit losses and are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Therefore, management has concluded that there is no expectation of non-payment on its investment securities and will not record an allowance for credit losses on these investments. 

The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020 and requires modified-retrospective application, meaning a cumulative-effect adjustment is recorded as of the effective date without adjusting comparative periods. Management is prepared to implement the standard and will record the following as a result of adoption: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A $ 2.5 billion increase to the allowance for loan losses primarily representing the adjustment for recording reserves for expected losses, not simply those deemed to be already incurred, and extending the loss estimate period over the entire life of the loan; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A $ 0.6 billion increase to other assets related to deferred tax assets on the larger allowance for loan losses; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

An offsetting $ 1.9 billion decrease, net of tax, to the opening balance of retained earnings; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Immaterial adjustments to the following: 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

The carrying value of PCD loans and related accrued interest reflected in other assets; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities to record reserves for unfunded commitments. 

##TABLE_END Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance requires lessees to capitalize most leases on their balance sheet whereas under previous GAAP, only leases previously identified as capital leases were recognized on the lessee&#8217;s balance sheet. Leases previously identified as capital leases are generally identified as financing leases under the new guidance but otherwise their accounting treatment remains relatively unchanged. Leases previously identified as operating leases generally remain in that category under the new standard, but both a right-of-use asset and a liability for remaining lease payments are required to be recognized on the balance sheet for this type of lease. The manner in which expenses associated with all leases are reported on the income statement remains mostly unchanged. Lessor accounting also remains substantially unchanged by the new standard. The new guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and, as permitted by the standard, management elected to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the effective date without adjusting comparative prior periods. Additionally, management elected the practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to (1) contracts containing leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. Management also made an accounting policy election to exclude short-term leases of one year or less from the balance sheet. As a result of adoption, the Company recorded immaterial adjustments to other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities to recognize operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 49 million and operating lease liabilities of $ 56 million , respectively. Leases are not material to the Company or its consolidated financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

##TABLE_END Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents is defined by the Company as cash on deposit with banks, including time deposits and other highly liquid investments, with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. Cash and cash equivalents included $ 959 million and $ 728 million of cash and due from banks and $ 6.0 billion and $ 12.6 billion of interest-earning deposits at other banks at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Restricted Cash 

Restricted cash includes cash for which the Company&#8217;s ability to withdraw funds at any time is contractually limited. Restricted cash is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations. 

Investment Securities 

At December 31, 2019 , investment securities consisted of U.S. Treasury obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies. Investment securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost. All other investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, as the Company does not hold investment securities for trading purposes. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) included in stockholders&#8217; equity. The Company estimates the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities as more fully discussed in Note 20: Fair Value Measurements. The amortized cost for each held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment security is adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts, as appropriate. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income. The Company evaluates its unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with GAAP applicable for investments in debt securities. Realized gains and losses and the credit loss portion of other-than-temporary impairments related to investment securities are determined at the individual security level and are reported in other income. 

Loan Receivables 

Loan receivables consist of credit card receivables, other loans and PCI loans. Loan receivables also include unamortized net deferred loan origination fees and costs (also see &#8220;&#8212; Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies &#8212; Loan Interest and Fee Income&#8221;). Credit card loan receivables are reported at their principal amounts outstanding and include uncollected billed interest and fees and are reduced for unearned revenue related to balance transfer fees (also see &#8220;&#8212; Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies &#8212; Loan Interest and Fee Income&#8221;). Other loans consist of student loans, personal loans and other loans and are reported at their principal amounts outstanding. For student loans, principal amounts outstanding also include accrued interest that has been capitalized. The Company&#8217;s loan receivables are deemed to be held for investment at origination or acquisition because management has the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future. Cash flows associated with loans originated or acquired for investment are classified as cash flows from investing activities, regardless of a subsequent change in intent. 

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 

PCI loans are loans acquired at prices that reflected a discount related to deterioration in individual loan credit quality since origination. The Company&#8217;s PCI loans are comprised entirely of acquired private student loans. 

The PCI student loans were aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics at the time of their acquisition. Loans were grouped primarily on the basis of origination date as loans originated in a particular year generally reflect the application of common origination strategies and/or underwriting criteria. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset and each has a single composite interest rate, total contractual cash flows and total expected cash flows. 

Interest income on PCI loans is recognized on the basis of expected cash flows rather than contractual cash flows. The total amount of interest income recognizable on a pool of PCI loans (i.e., its accretable yield) is the difference between the carrying amount of the loan pool and the future cash flows expected to be collected without regard to whether the expected cash flows represent principal or interest collections. Interest is recognized on an effective yield basis over the life of the loan pool. 

- 82 - 

The initial estimates of the fair value of the PCI student loans included the impact of expected credit losses, and therefore, no allowance for loan losses was recorded as of the purchase dates. The difference between contractually required cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected, as measured at the acquisition dates, is not permitted to be accreted. Charge-offs are absorbed by this non-accretable difference and do not result in a charge to earnings. However, as noted below, a charge to provision expense may be necessary to the extent that expected credit losses increase after the acquisition date. 

The estimate of cash flows expected to be collected is evaluated each reporting period to ensure it reflects management&#8217;s latest expectations of future credit losses and borrower prepayments, and interest rates in effect in the current period. To the extent expected credit losses increase after the acquisition dates, the Company will record an allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses, which will reduce net income. Changes in expected cash flows related to changes in prepayments or interest rate indices for variable-rate loans generally are recorded prospectively as adjustments to interest income. 

To the extent that a significant increase in cash flows due to lower expected losses is deemed probable, the Company will first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase the amount of remaining accretable yield. The increase to yield would be recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the loan pool. An increase in the accretable yield would reduce the remaining non-accretable difference available to absorb subsequent charge-offs. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans or receipt of payments in full from the borrower or charge-offs, result in removal of the loans from their respective pools. 

Delinquent Loans and Charge-Offs 

The entire balance of an account is contractually past due if the minimum payment is not received by the specified date on the customer&#8217;s billing statement. Delinquency is reported on loans that are 30 days or more past due. 

Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days past due. Closed-end consumer loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past due. Customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off by the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but not later than the 180-day or 120-day time frame described above. Receivables associated with alleged or potential fraudulent transactions are adjusted to their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of such fraud through a charge to other expense and are subsequently written off at the end of the month 90 days following notification, but not later than the contractual 180-day or 120-day time frame described above. The Company&#8217;s charge-off policies are designed to comply with guidelines established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;). 

The Company&#8217;s net charge-offs include the principal amount of loans charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. 

The practice of re-aging an account also may affect loan delinquencies and charge-offs. A re-age is intended to assist delinquent customers who have experienced financial difficulties but who demonstrate both an ability and willingness to repay. Accounts meeting specific criteria are re-aged when the Company and the customer agree on a temporary repayment schedule that may include concessionary terms. With re-aging, the outstanding balance of a delinquent account is returned to a current status. Customers may also qualify for a workout re-age when either a longer term or permanent hardship exists. The Company&#8217;s re-age practices are designed to comply with FFIEC guidelines. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The estimate of probable incurred losses considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees associated with the Company&#8217;s loan receivables. The allowance is evaluated quarterly for appropriateness and is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses. Charge-offs of principal amounts of loans outstanding are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries of such amounts increase the allowance. Charge-offs of loan balances representing unpaid interest and fees result in a reversal of interest and fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for loan losses (also see &#8220;&#8212; Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies &#8212; Loan Interest and Fee Income&#8221;). 

The Company calculates its allowance for loan losses by estimating probable losses separately for classes of the loan portfolio with similar loan characteristics, which generally results in segmenting the portfolio by loan product type. 

- 83 - 

The Company bases its allowance for loan losses on several analyses that help estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date. While the Company&#8217;s estimation process includes historical data and analysis, there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. For substantially all of its loan receivables, the Company uses a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The Company uses other analyses to estimate losses incurred on non-delinquent and bankrupt accounts. The considerations in these analyses include past and current loan performance, loan growth and seasoning, current risk management practices, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes and forecasting uncertain ties. Consideration of past and current loan performance includes the post-modification performance of loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. F or the majority of its portfolio, the Company estimates its allowance for loan losses on a pooled basis, which includes loans that are delinquent and/or no longer accruing interest and/or certain loans that have defaulted from a loan modification program. 

As part of certain collection strategies, the Company may modify the terms of loans to customers experiencing financial hardship. Temporary and permanent modifications on credit card and personal loans, as well as temporary modifications on student loans and certain grants of student loan forbearance are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. The Company classifies a modified loan in which a concession has been granted to the borrower as a troubled debt restructuring based on the cumulative length of the concession period and credit quality of the borrower. 

Loan receivables, other than PCI loans, that have been modified under a troubled debt restructuring are evaluated separately from the pools of receivables that are subject to the collective analyses described above. Loan receivables modified in a troubled debt restructuring are recorded at their present values with impairment measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected. Consistent with the Company&#8217;s measurement of impairment of modified loans on a pooled basis, the discount rate used for credit card loans in internal programs is the average current annual percentage rate applied to non-impaired credit card loans, which approximates what would have applied to the pool of modified loans prior to modification. The discount rate used for credit card loans in external programs reflects a rate that is consistent with rates offered to cardmembers not in a program that have similar risk characteristics. For student and personal loans, the discount rate used is the average contractual rate prior to modification. Changes in the present value are recorded in the provision for loan losses. All of the Company&#8217;s troubled debt restructurings, which are evaluated collectively on an aggregated (by loan type) basis, have a related allowance for loan losses. 

Premises and Equipment, net 

Premises and equipment, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated over a period of 39 years . The costs of improvements are capitalized and depreciated either over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life, typically ten years to fifteen years , or over the remaining term of the lease, when applicable. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a period of five years to ten years . Equipment is depreciated over three years to ten years . Maintenance and repairs are immediately expensed, while the costs of improvements are capitalized. 

Purchased software and capitalized costs related to internally developed software are amortized over their useful lives of three years to ten years . Costs incurred during the application development stage related to internally developed software are capitalized. Costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage. Once the capitalization criteria as defined in GAAP have been met, external direct costs incurred for materials and services used in developing or obtaining internal-use computer software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the internal-use computer software project (to the extent those employees devoted time directly to the project) are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software is included in premises and equipment, net in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 6: Premises and Equipment for further information about the Company&#8217;s premises and equipment. 

Cloud computing arrangements involving the licensing of software that meet certain criteria are recognized as the acquisition of software. Such assets are measured at the present value of the license obligation, if the license is to be paid over time, in addition to any capitalized upfront costs and amortized over the life of the arrangement. Cloud computing arrangements that do not meet the criteria to be recognized as acquired software are accounted for as service contracts. To date, none of the Company&#8217;s cloud computing arrangements have met the criteria to be recognized as acquired software. 

- 84 - 

Premises and equipment are subject to impairment testing when events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable from future cash flows. See &#8220;&#8212; Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional details on impairment testing. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is recorded as part of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company&#8217;s goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test at the reporting unit level annually as of October 1, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company&#8217;s reported goodwill relates to PULSE, which it acquired in 2005. The Company&#8217;s goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. No impairment was identified during the impairment test conducted as of October 1, 2019 . 

Intangible Assets 

The Company&#8217;s identifiable intangible assets consist of both amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets. The Company&#8217;s amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer relationships and certain trade name intangibles. All of the Company&#8217;s amortizable intangible assets are carried at net book value and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The amortization periods approximate the periods over which the Company expects to generate future net cash inflows from the use of these assets. The Company&#8217;s policy is to amortize intangibles in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the projected net cash inflows to the Company are expected to occur, where such pattern can be reasonably determined, as opposed to the straight-line basis. This method of amortization typically results in a greater portion of the intangible asset being amortized in the earlier years of its useful life. 

All of the Company&#8217;s amortizable intangible assets, as well as other amortizable or depreciable long-lived assets such as premises and equipment, are subject to impairment testing when events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable from future cash flows. A test for recoverability is done by comparing the asset&#8217;s carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted future net cash inflows expected to be generated from the use of the asset over its remaining useful life. Impairment exists if the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash inflows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment would result in a write-down of the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of these assets are based on the discounted present value of the stream of future net cash inflows expected to be derived over the remaining useful lives of the assets. If an impairment write-down is recorded, the remaining useful life of the asset will be evaluated to determine whether revision of the remaining amortization or depreciation period is appropriate. 

The Company&#8217;s non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of the brand-related intangibles and international transaction processing rights included in the acquisition of Diners Club. These assets are deemed to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not subject to amortization. All of the Company&#8217;s non-amortizable intangible assets are subject to a test for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. As required by GAAP, if the carrying value of a non-amortizable intangible asset is in excess of its fair value, the asset must be written down to its fair value through the recognition of an impairment charge to earnings. In contrast to amortizable intangibles, there is no test for recoverability associated with the impairment test for non-amortizable intangible assets. No significant impairment concerns were identified during the impairment test conducted as of October 1, 2019 . 

Stock-based Compensation 

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period. Awards to employees who are retirement-eligible at any point during the year are amortized over 12 months in accordance with the vesting terms that apply under those circumstances. No compensation cost is recognized for awards that are subsequently forfeited. 

- 85 - 

Advertising Costs 

The Company expenses television and radio advertising costs in the period in which the advertising is first aired and all other advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are recorded in marketing and business development and were $ 264 million , $ 258 million and $ 219 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized when their realization is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions are measured at the highest amount of tax benefit for which realization is judged to be more likely than not. Tax benefits that do not meet these criteria are unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 15: Income Taxes for more information about the Company&#8217;s income taxes. 

Financial Instruments Used for Asset and Liability Management 

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage its various exposures to changes in fair value of certain assets and liabilities, variability in future cash flows arising from changes in interest rates or other types of forecasted transactions, and changes in foreign exchange rates. All derivatives are carried at their estimated fair values on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. Derivatives having gross positive fair values, inclusive of net accrued interest receipts or payments, are recorded in other assets. Derivatives with gross negative fair values, inclusive of net accrued interest payments or receipts, are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The methodologies used to estimate the fair values of these derivative financial instruments are described in Note 20: Fair Value Measurements. Variation margin payments associated with derivative positions that are cleared through an exchange are legally characterized as settlements of the derivative positions. Such settlement payments are reflected as offsets to the associated derivatives balances recorded in other assets or in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The impact of settlement payments on the consolidated statements of financial condition is discussed in more detail in Note 21: Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Other cash c ollateral receivable or payable amounts associated with derivatives are not offset against the fair value of these derivatives, but are recorded separately in other assets or deposits, respectively. 

Certain of these instruments are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. A hedge is deemed effective to the extent that the change in fair value, cash flow, or net investment of the hedged item is offset by changes in the hedging instrument. Under cash flow hedge accounting, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged forecasted cash flows affect earnings. In a net investment hedge, amounts accumulated in OCI are reclassified into earnings when a hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Under fair value hedge accounting, changes in both (i) the fair values of the derivative instruments and (ii) the fair values of the hedged items relating to the risks being hedged, including net differences, if any, are recorded in interest expense. Certain other derivatives are not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting; changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other income. These transactions are discussed in more detail in Note 21: Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 

The Company records unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, and certain pension and foreign currency translation adjustments in OCI on an after-tax basis where applicable. The Company&#8217;s policy is to adjust the tax effects of a component of AOCI in the same period in which the item is sold or otherwise derecognized, or when the carrying value of the item is remeasured. Details of OCI, net of tax, are presented in the statement of comprehensive income, and a rollforward of AOCI is presented in the statement of changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and Note 13: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. 

Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies 

Loan Interest and Fee Income 

Interest on loans is comprised largely of interest on credit card loans and is recognized based on the amount of loans outstanding and their contractual interest rate. Interest on credit card loans is included in loan receivables when billed to the customer. The Company accrues unbilled interest revenue each month from a customer&#8217;s billing cycle date to the end of the month. The Company applies an estimate of the percentage of loans that will revolve in the next cycle 

- 86 - 

in the estimation of the accrued unbilled portion of interest revenue that is included in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest on other loan receivables is accrued each month in accordance with their contractual terms and recorded in accrued interest receivable, which is included in other assets, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest related to PCI loans is discussed in Note 4: Loan Receivables. 

The Company recognizes fees (except balance transfer fees and certain product fees) on loan receivables in interest income or loan fee income as the fees are assessed. Balance transfer fees and certain product fees are recognized in interest income or loan fee income ratably over the periods to which they relate. Balance transfer fees are accreted to interest income over the life of the related balance. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , deferred revenues related to balance transfer fees, recorded as a reduction of loan receivables, were $ 67 million and $ 52 million , respectively. Loan fee income consists of fees on credit card loans and includes late, cash advance, returned check and other miscellaneous fees and is reflected net of waivers and charge-offs. 

Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one year period and recorded in interest income from credit card loans. Direct loan origination costs on other loan receivables are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan using the interest method and are recorded in interest income from other loans. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the remaining unamortized deferred costs related to loan origination were $ 178 million and $ 138 million , respectively, and were recorded in loan receivables. 

The Company accrues interest and fees on loan receivables until the loans are paid or charged off, except in instances of customer bankruptcy, death or fraud, where no further interest and fee accruals occur following notification. Credit card and closed-end consumer loan receivables are placed on non-accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a customer or suspected fraudulent activity on an account. Upon completion of the fraud investigation, non-fraudulent credit card and closed-end consumer loan receivables may resume accruing interest. Payments received on non-accrual loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy applied to loans that are accruing interest. When loan receivables are charged off, unpaid accrued interest and fees are reversed against the income line items in which they were originally recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Charge-offs and recoveries of amounts that relate to capitalized interest on student loans are treated as principal charge-offs and recoveries, affecting the provision for loan losses rather than interest income. The Company considers uncollectible interest and fee revenues in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 

Interest income from loans individually evaluated for impairment, including loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings, is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not in such programs. 

Discount and Interchange Revenue 

The Company earns discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom it has entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. The Company earns acquirer interchange revenue primarily from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network, Diners Club and PULSE transactions made by credit and debit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing payment card transactions. These card acceptance arrangements generally renew automatically and do not have fixed durations. Under these agreements, the Company stands ready to process payment transactions as and when each is presented. The Company earns discount, interchange and similar fees only when transactions are processed. Contractually defined per-transaction fee amounts typically apply to each type of transaction processed and are recognized as revenue at the time each transaction is captured for settlement. These fees are typically collected by the Company as part of the process of settling transactions daily with merchants and acquirers and are fully earned at the time settlement is made. 

The Company pays issuer interchange to card-issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network and on certain transactions on the Diners Club and PULSE networks. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card-issuing organization&#8217;s transaction volume. The Company classifies this cost as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue. Costs of cardholder reward arrangements, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, are classified as reductions of discount and interchange revenue pursuant to guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 606 governing consideration payable to a customer. For both issuer interchange and cardholder rewards, the Company accrues the cost at the time each underlying card transaction is captured for settlement. 

- 87 - 

Customer Rewards 

The Company offers its customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their credit card purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer&#8217;s purchases. The liability for customer rewards, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition, is recorded on an individual customer basis and is accumulated as qualified customers earn rewards through their ongoing credit card purchase activity or other defined actions. The Company recognizes customer rewards costs as a reduction of the related revenue, if any. In instances where a reward is not associated with a revenue-generating transaction, such as when a reward is given for opening an account, the reward cost is recorded as an operating expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , rewards costs amounted to $ 1.9 billion , $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.6 billion , respectively. The liability for customer rewards was $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Protection Products Revenue 

The Company earns revenue related to fees received for ancillary products and services, including payment protection and identity theft protection services, to its credit card customers. A portion of this revenue comprises amounts earned for arranging for the delivery of products offered by third-party service providers. The amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customer&#8217;s outstanding balance or a flat fee, in either case assessed monthly, and is recognized as earned. These contracts are month-to-month arrangements that are cancellable at any time. The Company recognizes each monthly fee in the period to which the service or coverage relates. 

Transaction Processing Revenue 

Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants under network participation agreements for processing ATM, debit and point-of-sale transactions over the PULSE network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Network participation agreements generally renew automatically and do not have fixed durations, although the Company does enter into fixed-term pricing or incentive arrangements with certain network participants. The impact of such incentives is not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. Similar to discount and interchange fees, switch fees are contractually defined per-transaction fee amounts and are assessed and recognized as revenue at the time each transaction is captured for settlement. These fees are typically collected by the Company as part of the process of settling transactions with network participants. Membership and other participation fees are recognized over the periods to which each fee relates. 

Other Income 

Other income includes sales-based royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, merchant fees, certain payments from merchants related to reward programs, revenues from network partners and other miscellaneous revenue items. Sales-based royalty revenues are recognized as the related sales are reported by Diners franchisees. All remaining items of other income are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied. 

Future Revenue Associated with Customer Contracts 

For contracts under which the Company processes payment card transactions, the Company has the right to assess fees for services performed and to collect those fees through the settlement process. The Company generates essentially all of its discount and interchange revenue and transaction processing revenue, as well as some revenue reported as other income, through such contracts. There is no specified quantity of service promised in these contracts as the number of payment transactions is dependent upon cardholder behavior, which is outside the control of the Company and its network customers (i.e., merchants, acquirers, issuers and other network participants). As noted above, these contracts are typically without fixed durations and renew automatically. For these reasons, the Company does not make or disclose an estimate of revenue associated with performance obligations attributable to the remaining terms of these contracts. Future revenue associated with the Company&#8217;s sales-based royalty revenues earned from Diners Club licensees is similarly variable and open-ended, and therefore the Company does not make or disclose an estimate of royalties associated with performance obligations attributable to the remaining terms of the licensing and royalty arrangements. Because of the nature of the services and the manner of collection associated with the majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue from contracts with customers, material receivables or deferred revenues are not generated. 

- 88 - 

Incentive Payments 

The Company makes certain incentive payments under contractual arrangements with financial institutions, Diners Club licensees, merchants, acquirers and certain other customers. These payments are generally classified as contra-revenue unless a distinct good or service is received by the Company in consideration for the payment and the fair value of the good or service can be reasonably estimated. If no such good or service is identified, then the entire payment is classified as contra-revenue and included in the consolidated statements of income in the line item where the related revenues are recorded. If the payment gives rise to an asset because it is expected to directly or indirectly contribute to future net cash inflows, it is deferred and recognized over the expected benefit period. The unamortized portion of the deferred incentive payments included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition was $ 24 million and $ 23 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

The weighted-average yield for available-for-sale investment securities is calculated based on the amortized cost. 

##TABLE_END Taxable interest on investment securities was $ 179 million , $ 40 million and $ 27 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. There was no tax exempt interest on investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . 

Other Investments 

As a part of the Company&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives, the Company has made equity investments in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing, as well as stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities. These investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are recorded within other assets. The related commitment for future investments is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities within the consolidated statements of financial condition. The portion of each investment&#8217;s operating results allocable to the Company reduces the carrying value of the investments and is recorded in other expense within the consolidated statements of income. The Company further reduces the carrying value of the investments by recognizing any amounts that are in excess of future net tax benefits in other expense. The Company earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the affordable housing projects and the community revitalization projects. These investments are not consolidated as the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in the entities. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the 

- 91 - 

Company had outstanding investments in these entities of $ 336 million and $ 295 million , respectively, and related contingent liabilities of $ 74 million and $ 49 million , respectively. Of the above outstanding equity investments, the Company had $ 298 million and $ 271 million of investments related to affordable housing projects as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which had $ 59 million and $ 30 million related contingent liabilities, respectively. 

The Company holds non-controlling equity positions in several payments services entities. Most of these investments are not subject to equity method accounting because the Company does not have significant influence over the investee. The common or preferred equity securities that the Company hold typically do not have readily determinable fair values. As a result, the majority of these investments are carried at cost minus impairment, if any. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the carrying value of these investments, which is recorded within other assets, was $ 42 million and $ 40 million , respectively.

FICO scores are generally obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed monthly or quarterly thereafter to assist in predicting customer behavior. Historically, the Company has noted that a significant portion of delinquent accounts have FICO scores below 660. ##TABLE_START The following table provides the most recent FICO scores available for the Company&#8217;s customers as a percentage of each class of loan receivables:

The Company has internal loan modification programs that provide relief to credit card, personal loan and student loan borrowers who may be experiencing financial hardship. The Company continually evaluates new programs to determine which of them meet the definition of a TDR. The internal loan modification programs include both temporary and permanent programs, which vary by product. External loan modification programs are also available for credit card and personal loans. Temporary and permanent modifications on credit card and personal loans, as well as temporary modifications on student loans and certain grants of student loan forbearance, result in the loans being classified as individually impaired. In addition, loans that defaulted or graduated from modification programs or forbearance continue to be classified as individually impaired. 

For credit card customers, the Company offers both temporary and permanent hardship programs. The temporary hardship programs consist of an interest rate reduction and in some cases a reduced minimum payment, both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months . Charging privileges on these loans are generally suspended while in the program and if certain criteria are met, may be reinstated following completion of the program. Balances remaining at the end of the program as well as any new charges continue to be included in the balance of TDRs, contributing to the growth in total TDRs disclosed. In addition to helping customers with their credit needs, these programs are designed to maximize the collection cash flows and ultimately the Company&#8217;s profitability. 

The permanent modification program involves closing the account, changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The permanent modification program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. The Company also makes permanent loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. These loans typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. These loans remain in the population of TDRs until they are paid off or charged off. 

For personal loan customers, in certain situations the Company offers various payment programs, including temporary and permanent programs. The temporary programs normally consist of a reduction of the minimum payment for a period of no longer than 12 months with the option of a final balloon payment required at the end of the loan term or an extension of the maturity date with the total term not exceeding nine years . Further, in certain circumstances the interest rate on the loan is reduced. The permanent programs involve changing the terms of the loan in order to pay off the outstanding balance over a longer term and also in certain circumstances reducing the interest rate on the loan. Similar to the temporary programs, the total term may not exceed nine years . The Company also allows permanent loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, similar to the credit card customers discussed above. Payments are modified based on the new terms agreed upon with the credit counseling agency. Personal loans included in temporary and permanent programs are accounted for as TDRs. 

At December 31, 2019 , there was $ 5.6 billion of private student loans in repayment, which includes both PCI and non-PCI loans. To assist student loan borrowers who are experiencing temporary financial difficulties but are willing to resume making payments, the Company may offer hardship forbearance or programs that include payment deferral, temporary payment reduction, temporary interest rate reduction or extended terms. A non-PCI modified loan typically meets the definition of a TDR based on the cumulative length of the concession period and an evaluation of the credit quality of the borrower based on FICO scores. 

Borrower performance after using payment programs or forbearance is monitored and the Company believes the programs are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and help to prevent defaults. The Company plans to continue to use payment programs and forbearance as a means to provide relief to customers experiencing temporary financial difficulties and, as a result, expects to have additional loans classified as TDRs in the future.

The Company does not separately track interest income on loans in modification programs. Amounts shown are estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various modification programs. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

The Company does not separately track the amount of additional gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in modification programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms. Amounts shown are estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on non-impaired loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the modification programs to the average loans in the modification programs. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) 

Includes credit card loans that were modified in TDRs, but are no longer enrolled in a TDR program due to noncompliance with the terms of the modification or due to successful completion of a program after which charging privileges may be reinstated based on customer-level evaluation. The average balance of credit card loans that were no longer enrolled in a TDR program was $ 916 million , $ 430 million and $ 339 million , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . 

##TABLE_END In order to evaluate the primary financial effects that resulted from credit card loans entering into a loan modification program during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , the Company quantified the amount by which interest and fees were reduced during the periods. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , the Company forgave approximately $ 73 million , $ 48 million and $ 40 million , respectively, of interest and fees as a result of accounts entering into a credit card loan modification program.

Terms revert back to the pre-modification terms for customers who default from a temporary program and charging privileges remain revoked in most cases. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

For credit card loans and personal loans, a customer defaults from a modification program after two consecutive missed payments. The outstanding balance upon default is generally the loan balance at the end of the month prior to default. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) 

For student loans, defaults have been defined as loans that are 60 or more days delinquent. The outstanding balance upon default is generally the loan balance at the end of the month prior to default. 

##TABLE_END Of the account balances that defaulted as shown above for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , approximately 38 % , 36 % and 37 % , respectively, of the total balances were charged off at the end of the month in which they defaulted from a loan modification program. For accounts that have defaulted from a loan modification program and have not been subsequently charged off, the balances are included in the allowance for loan loss analysis discussed above under &#8220;&#8212; Allowance for Loan Losses.&#8221; 

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 

Purchased loans with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected are considered impaired at acquisition and are reported as PCI loans. The private student loans acquired as part of the Company&#8217;s acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation (&#8220;SLC&#8221;) as well as the additional acquired private student loan portfolio comprise the Company&#8217;s only PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Total PCI student loans had an outstanding balance of $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.7 billion , including accrued interest, and a related carrying amount of $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.6 billion , as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

##TABLE_END

Periodically, the Company updates the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected based on management&#8217;s latest expectations of future net credit losses, borrower prepayments and certain other assumptions that affect cash flows. No provision expense was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . The allowance for PCI loan losses at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $ 22 million and $ 25 million , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , the increase in accretable yield was primarily due to changes in rates on variable-rate loans. Changes to accretable yield are recognized prospectively as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the pools. 

At December 31, 2019 , the 30 or more days delinquency and 90 or more days delinquency rates on PCI student loans (which include loans not yet in repayment) were 2.92 % and 0.80 % , respectively. At December 31, 2018 , the 30 or more days delinquency and 90 or more days delinquency rates on PCI student loans (which include loans not yet in 

- 99 - 

repayment) were 2.93 % and 0.78 % , respectively. These rates include private student loans that are greater than 120 days delinquent that are covered by an indemnification agreement or insurance arrangements through which the Company expects to recover a substantial portion of the loan. The net charge-off rate on PCI student loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was 0.47 % , 0.63 % and 0.71 % , respectively.

Credit Card and Student Loan Securitization Activities 

##TABLE_END The Company&#8217;s securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings and the related trusts are treated as consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. For a description of the Company&#8217;s principles of consolidation with respect to VIEs, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation. 

Credit Card Securitization Activities 

The Company accesses the term asset securitization market through DCMT and DCENT. Credit card loan receivables are transferred into DCMT and beneficial interests in DCMT are transferred into DCENT. DCENT issues debt securities to investors that are reported in long-term borrowings. 

The DCENT debt structure consists of four classes of securities (DiscoverSeries Class A, B, C and D notes), with the most senior class generally receiving a triple-A rating. In order to issue senior, higher rated classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower rated or more highly subordinated classes of notes. The subordinated classes are held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Discover Bank. The Company is exposed to credit-related risk of loss associated with trust assets as of the balance sheet date through the retention of these subordinated interests. The estimated probable incurred loss is included in the allowance for loan losses estimate. 

The Company&#8217;s retained interests in the assets of the trusts, consisting of investments in DCENT notes held by subsidiaries of Discover Bank, constitute intercompany positions, which are eliminated in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Upon transfer of credit card loan receivables to the trust, the receivables and certain cash flows derived from them become restricted for use in meeting obligations to the trusts&#8217; creditors. Further, the transferred credit card loan receivables are owned by the trust and are not available to third-party creditors of the Company. The trusts have ownership of cash balances, the amounts of which are reported in restricted cash. With the exception of the seller&#8217;s interest in trust receivables, the Company&#8217;s interests in trust assets are generally subordinate to the interests of third-party investors and, as such, may not be realized by the Company if needed to absorb deficiencies in cash flows that are allocated to the investors in the trusts&#8217; debt. Apart from the restricted assets related to securitization activities, the investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Company&#8217;s other assets or the Company&#8217;s general credit for a shortage in cash flows. 

##TABLE_START The carrying values of these restricted assets, which are presented on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition as relating to securitization activities, are shown in the following table (dollars in millions):

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

The Company maintains its allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in all loan receivables, which includes all loan receivables in the trusts. Therefore, credit risk associated with the transferred receivables is fully reflected on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. 

##TABLE_END The debt securities issued by the consolidated trusts are subject to credit, payment and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loan receivables. To protect investors in the securities, there are certain features or triggering events that could cause an early amortization of the debt securities, including triggers related to the impact of the performance of the trust receivables on the availability and adequacy of cash flows to meet contractual requirements. As of December 31, 2019 , no economic or other early amortization events have occurred. 

- 101 - 

The Company continues to own and service the accounts that generate the loan receivables held by the trusts. Discover Bank receives servicing fees from the trusts based on a percentage of the monthly investor principal balance outstanding. Although the fee income to Discover Bank offsets the fee expense to the trusts and thus is eliminated in consolidation, failure to service the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements could lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing income, net of related expenses. 

Student Loan Securitization Activities 

Student loan trust receivables are recorded in PCI loans and the related debt issued by the trusts is reported in long-term borrowings. The assets of the trusts are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral for other borrowings and the cash flows from these restricted assets may be used only to pay obligations of the trusts. With the exception of the trusts&#8217; restricted assets, the trusts and investors have no recourse to the Company&#8217;s other assets or the Company&#8217;s general credit for a shortage in cash flows. 

Securities issued to investors are outstanding from only one of the two remaining student loan securitization trusts. Principal payments on the long-term secured borrowings are made as cash is collected on the underlying loans that are used as collateral on the secured borrowings. The Company does not have access to cash collected by the securitization trust until cash is released in accordance with the trust indenture agreement. Similar to the credit card securitizations, the Company continues to own and service the accounts that generate the student loan receivables held by the trust and receives servicing fees from the trust based on a percentage of the principal balance outstanding. Although the servicing fee income offsets the fee expense related to the trust and thus is eliminated in consolidation, failure to service the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements could lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing income, net of related expenses. 

Under terms of the trust arrangement, the Company has the option, but not the obligation, to provide financial support to the trust, but has never provided such support. A substantial portion of the credit risk associated with the securitized loans has been transferred to a third party under an indemnification arrangement.

private providers was $ 6.0 billion , $ 500 million of which was drawn at December 31, 2019 . Access to the unused portions of the secured credit facilities is subject to the terms of the agreements with each of the providers, which have various expirations in calendar years 2021 through 2022. Borrowings outstanding under each facility bear interest at a margin above LIBOR or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each individual conduit provider. The terms of each agreement provide for a commitment fee to be paid on the unused capacity and include various affirmative and negative covenants, including performance metrics and legal requirements similar to those required to issue any term securitization transaction.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans 

##TABLE_END The Company has two stock-based compensation plans: the Discover Financial Services Omnibus Incentive Plan (&#8220;Omnibus Plan&#8221;) and the Discover Financial Services Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan (&#8220;Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan&#8221;). 

Omnibus Plan 

The Omnibus Plan, which is stockholder approved, provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), performance stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) and other stock-based and/or cash awards (collectively, &#8220;awards&#8221;). Currently, the Company does not have any stock options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock outstanding. The total number of shares that may be granted is 45 million shares, subject to adjustments for certain transactions as described in the Omnibus Plan document. Shares granted under the Omnibus Plan may be the following: (i) authorized but unissued shares and (ii) treasury shares that the Company acquires in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise. 

Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan 

The Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan, which is stockholder approved, permits the grant of RSUs to non-employee directors. Under the Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan, the Company may issue awards of up to a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock to non-employee directors. Shares of stock that are issuable pursuant to the awards granted under the Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan may be authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares that the Company acquires in the open market. Annual awards for eligible directors are calculated by dividing $ 150,000 by the fair market value of a share of stock on the date of grant and are subject to a restriction period whereby 100 % of such units shall vest in full on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or immediately prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders following the date of grant. RSUs include the right to receive dividend equivalents in the same amount and at the same time as dividends paid to all Company common shareholders.

##TABLE_END Compensation cost associated with PSUs is determined based on the number of instruments granted, the fair value on the date of grant and the performance factor. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Each PSU outstanding at December 31, 2019 is a restricted stock instrument that is subject to additional conditions and constitutes a contingent and unsecured promise by the Company to pay up to 1.5 shares per unit of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the conversion date for the PSU, contingent on the number of PSUs to be issued. PSUs have a performance period of three years and a vesting period of three years . The requisite service period of an award, having both performance and service conditions, is the longest of the explicit, implicit and derived service periods. 

##TABLE_START The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value of the PSUs converted to common stock and the total grant-date fair value of PSUs vested (dollars in millions, except weighted-average grant-date fair value amounts):

##TABLE_END

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was estimated by computing a weighted-average return of the underlying long-term expected returns on the different asset classes, based on the target asset allocations. Asset class return assumptions are created by integrating information on past capital market performance, current levels of key economic indicators and the market insights of investment professionals. Individual asset classes are analyzed as part of a larger system, acknowledging both the interaction between asset classes and the influence of larger macroeconomic variables such as inflation and economic growth on the entire structure of capital markets. Medium and long-term economic outlooks for the U.S. and other major industrial economies are forecast in order to understand the range of possible economic scenarios and evaluate their likelihood. Historical relationships between key economic variables and asset class performance patterns are analyzed using empirical models. Finally, comprehensive asset class performance projections are created by blending descriptive asset class characteristics with capital market insight and 

- 110 - 

the initial economic analyses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is a long-term assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one year to the next but is adjusted if there is a material change in the target asset allocation and/or significant changes in fees and expenses paid by the Discover Pension Plan. 

Discover Pension Plan Assets 

The targeted asset allocation for 2020 by asset class is 72 % and 28 % for fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively. The Discover Financial Services Retirement Plan Investment Committee (the &#8220;Investment Committee&#8221;) determined the asset allocation targets for the Discover Pension Plan based on its assessment of business and financial conditions, demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including industry practices and long-term historical and prospective capital market returns were considered as well. 

The Discover Pension Plan return objectives provide long-term measures for monitoring the investment performance against growth in the pension obligations. The overall allocation is expected to help protect the Discover Pension Plan&#8217;s funded status while generating sufficiently stable real returns (net of inflation) to help cover current and future benefit payments and to improve the Discover Pension Plan&#8217;s funded status. Total Discover Pension Plan portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual returns with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&#38;P 500 Index, the S&#38;P 500 Total Return Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the MSCI All Country World Index. 

Both the fixed income and equity portions of the asset allocation use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles. The fixed income asset allocation consists of longer duration fixed income securities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better correlate assets with obligations. The longer duration fixed income allocation is expected to help stabilize the funding status ratio over the long term. 

The asset mix of the Discover Pension Plan is reviewed by the Investment Committee on a regular basis. The asset allocation strategy will change over time in response to changes in the Discover Pension Plan&#8217;s funded status.

Fair Value Measurements 

##TABLE_START The Discover Pension Plan&#8217;s assets are stated at fair value. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of the fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances. The table below presents information about the Discover Pension Plan assets and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy, as defined by ASC Topic 820, with which each item is associated as of the end of the current period. For a description of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 20: Fair Value Measurements. (dollars in millions):

##TABLE_START (1) 

See Note 3: Investments &#8212; Other Investments for a description of these investments. 

##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2019 , income tax expense increased $ 23 million , or 2.7 % , and the effective income tax rate decreased 0.9 percentage points as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by increased pretax income. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. 

Income tax expense decreased $ 583 million , or 40.5 % , and the effective tax rate decreased 16.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 . The decrease in both the effective tax rate and income tax expense was primarily due to a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% and other impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

##TABLE_START Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company evaluates the likelihood of realizing its deferred tax assets by estimating sources of future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies. Significant components of the Company&#8217;s net deferred income taxes, which are included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition, were as follows (dollars in millions):

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , amounts included $ 54 million , $ 74 million and $ 105 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate. 

##TABLE_END The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $ 14 million and $ 15 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

- 117 - 

The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) and tax authorities in various state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments or settlements in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years&#8217; examinations. The years 2011-2015 are currently under review by the IRS Office of Appeals. At this time, the potential change in unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to be significant over the next 12 months. The Company believes that its reserves are sufficient to cover any tax, penalties and interest that would result from such examinations. 

The Company has an immaterial amount of state net operating loss carryforwards that are subject to a partial valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Capital Adequacy 

##TABLE_END The Company is subject to the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve, and Discover Bank, the Company&#8217;s main banking subsidiary, is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as administered by the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial position and results of the Company and Discover Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Discover Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidelines. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

The Company and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory and capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and FDIC, respectively, under the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework (&#8220;Basel III rules&#8221;). The Basel III rules, which became effective for the Company January 2015, were subject to phase-in periods through the end of 2018, based on the Company being classified as a &#8220;Standardized Approach&#8221; entity. As of January 1, 2019, the Basel III rules subject to transition have all been fully phased in with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulation issued in November 2017. Pursuant to a final rule issued in July 2019, the transition provisions that were previously frozen will be replaced with new permanent rules effective in April 2020 with the option to early adopt beginning on January 1, 2020. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company and Discover Bank met all Basel III minimum capital ratio requirements to which they were subject. The Company and Discover Bank also met the requirements to be considered &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under Regulation Y and prompt corrective action regulations, respectively, and there have been no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Company&#8217;s or Discover Bank&#8217;s category. To be categorized as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; the Company and Discover Bank must maintain minimum capital ratios as set forth in the table below.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees 

##TABLE_END In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments, transactions and obligations under guarantee arrangements that expose the Company to varying degrees of risk. The Company&#8217;s commitments, contingencies and guarantee relationships are described below. 

Commitments 

Unused Credit Arrangements 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company had unused credit arrangements for loans of approximately $ 206.7 billion . Such arrangements arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions in the related agreements. These arrangements, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness and loan qualification. 

Contingencies 

See Note 19: Litigation and Regulatory Matters for a description of potential liability arising from pending litigation or regulatory proceedings involving the Company. 

Guarantees 

The Company has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts, indemnification agreements, and representations and warranties, which contingently require the Company to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Company to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement. The Company&#8217;s use of guarantees is disclosed below by type of guarantee. 

Securitizations Representations and Warranties 

As part of the Company&#8217;s financing activities, the Company provides representations and warranties that certain assets pledged as collateral in secured borrowing arrangements conform to specified guidelines. Due diligence is performed by the Company, which is intended to ensure that asset guideline qualifications are met. If the assets pledged as collateral do not meet certain conforming guidelines, the Company may be required to replace, repurchase or sell such assets. In its credit card securitization activities, the Company would replace nonconforming receivables through the allocation of excess seller&#8217;s interest or from additional transfers from the unrestricted pool of receivables. If the Company could not add enough receivables to satisfy the requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors&#8217; interests would be triggered. In its student loan securitizations, the Company would generally repurchase the loans from the trust at the outstanding principal amount plus interest. 

The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of third-party investor interests in credit card asset-backed securities, and the principal amount of any student loan secured borrowings, plus any unpaid interest for the corresponding secured borrowings. The Company has recorded substantially all of the maximum potential amount of future payments in long-term borrowings on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company has not recorded any incremental contingent liability associated with its secured borrowing representations and warranties. Management believes that the probability of having to replace, repurchase or sell assets pledged as collateral under secured borrowing arrangements, including an early amortization event, is low. 

Counterparty Settlement Guarantees 

Diners Club and DFS Services LLC (on behalf of PULSE) have various counterparty exposures, which are listed below. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Merchant Guarantee . Diners Club has entered into contractual relationships with certain international merchants, which generally include travel-related businesses, for the benefit of all Diners Club licensees. The licensees hold the primary liability to settle the transactions of their customers with these merchants. However, Diners Club retains a counterparty exposure if a licensee fails to meet its financial payment obligation to one of these merchants. 

##TABLE_END 

- 121 - 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

ATM Guarantee. PULSE entered into contractual relationships with certain international ATM acquirers in which DFS Services LLC retains counterparty exposure if an issuer fails to fulfill its settlement obligation. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Network Alliance Guarantee. Discover Network, Diners Club and PULSE have entered into contractual relationships with certain international payment networks in which DFS Services LLC retains the counterparty exposure if a network fails to fulfill its settlement obligation. 

##TABLE_END The maximum potential amount of future payments related to such contingent obligations is dependent upon the transaction volume processed between the time a potential counterparty defaults on its settlement and the time at which the Company disables the settlement of any further transactions for the defaulting party. The Company has some contractual remedies to offset these counterparty settlement exposures (such as letters of credit or pledged deposits), however, there is no limitation on the maximum amount the Company may be liable to pay. 

The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the Company cannot determine whether particular counterparties will fail to meet their settlement obligations. In the event that all licensees and/or issuers were to become unable to settle their transactions, the Company estimates its maximum potential counterparty exposures to these settlement guarantees would be approximately $ 160 million as of December 31, 2019 . 

The Company believes that the estimated amounts of maximum potential future payments are not representative of the Company&#8217;s actual potential loss exposure given Diners Club&#8217;s and PULSE&#8217;s insignificant historical losses from these counterparty exposures. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these counterparty exposures and management believes that the probability of any payments under these arrangements is low. 

Discover Network Merchant Chargeback Guarantees 

The Company operates the Discover Network, issues payment cards and permits third parties to issue payment cards. The Company is contingently liable for certain transactions processed on the Discover Network in the event of a dispute between the payment card customer and a merchant. The contingent liability arises if the disputed transaction involves a merchant or merchant acquirer with whom the Discover Network has a direct relationship. If a dispute is resolved in the customer&#8217;s favor, the Discover Network will credit or refund the disputed amount to the Discover Network card issuer, who in turn credits its customer&#8217;s account. The Discover Network will then charge back the disputed amount of the payment card transaction to the merchant or merchant acquirer, where permitted by the applicable agreement, to seek recovery of amounts already paid to the merchant for payment card transactions. If the Discover Network is unable to collect the amount subject to dispute from the merchant or merchant acquirer (e.g., in the event of merchant default or dissolution or after expiration of the time period for chargebacks in the applicable agreement), the Discover Network will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the customer. In most instances, a loss by the Discover Network is unlikely to arise in connection with payments on card transactions because most products or services are delivered when purchased and credits are issued by merchants on returned items in a timely fashion, thus minimizing the likelihood of cardholder disputes with respect to amounts paid by the Discover Network. However, where the product or service is not scheduled to be provided to the customer until a later date following the purchase, the likelihood of a contingent payment obligation by the Discover Network increases. Losses related to merchant chargebacks were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . 

The maximum potential amount of obligations of the Discover Network arising as a result of such contingent obligations is estimated to be the portion of the total Discover Network transaction volume processed to date for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant issuer and customer agreements. There is no limitation on the maximum amount the Company may be liable to pay to issuers. However, the Company believes that such amount is not representative of the Company&#8217;s actual potential loss exposure based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience. The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the Company cannot determine whether the current or cumulative transaction volumes may include or result in disputed transactions.

The Company did not record any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for merchant chargeback guarantees as of December 31, 2019 or 2018 . The Company mitigates the risk of potential loss exposure by withholding settlement from merchants, obtaining third-party guarantees, or obtaining escrow deposits or letters of credit from certain merchant acquirers or merchants that are considered higher risk due to various factors such as time delays in the delivery of products or services. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had escrow deposits and settlement withholdings of $ 8 million and $ 10 million , respectively, which are recorded in interest-bearing deposit accounts and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. 

##TABLE_START 19. 

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

##TABLE_END In the normal course of business, from time to time, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. The litigation process is not predictable and can lead to unexpected results. The Company contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. 

The Company has historically offered its customers an arbitration clause in its customer agreements. The arbitration clause allows the Company and its customers to quickly and economically resolve disputes. Additionally, the arbitration clause has in some instances limited the costs of, and the Company&#8217;s exposure to, litigation. Future legal and regulatory challenges and prohibitions may cause the Company to discontinue its offering and use of such clauses. From time to time, the Company is involved in legal actions challenging its arbitration clause. Bills may be periodically introduced in Congress to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses. 

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding the Company&#8217;s business including, among other matters, consumer regulatory, accounting, tax and other operational matters, some of which may result in significant adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, decreases in regulatory ratings, customer restitution or other relief, which could materially impact the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, increase its cost of operations, or limit its ability to execute its business strategies and engage in certain business activities. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to a consent order with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) regarding certain student loan servicing practices, as described below. Pursuant to powers granted under federal banking laws, regulatory agencies have broad and sweeping discretion, and may assess civil money penalties, require changes to certain business practices or require customer restitution at any time. 

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. Litigation and regulatory settlement related expense was not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . 

There may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (meaning those losses the likelihood of which is more than remote but less than likely) in excess of the amounts that the Company has accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings is up to $ 135 million . This estimated range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Company is involved, takes into account the Company&#8217;s best estimate of such losses for those matters for which an estimate can be made, and does not represent the Company&#8217;s maximum potential loss exposure. Various aspects of the legal proceedings underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated range above involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues, the breadth of the claims (often spanning multiple years and, in some cases, a wide range of business activities), unspecified damages and/or the novelty of the legal issues presented. The outcome of pending matters could be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, the level of the Company&#8217;s income for such period, and could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation. 

On February 13, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board announced that the May 26, 2015 written agreement between the Company and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago related to the Company&#8217;s enterprise-wide anti-money laundering and related compliance programs has been terminated effective February 5, 2020. 

On July 22, 2015, the Company announced that its subsidiaries, Discover Bank, SLC and Discover Products Inc. (the &#8220;Discover Subsidiaries&#8221;), agreed to a consent order with the CFPB resolving the agency&#8217;s investigation with respect 

- 123 - 

to certain student loan servicing practices. The order required the Discover Subsidiaries to provide redress of approximately $ 16 million to consumers who may have been affected by the activities described in the order related to certain collection calls, overstatements of minimum payment due amounts in billing statements, and provision of interest paid information to consumers, and provide regulatory disclosures with respect to loans acquired in default. In addition, the Discover Subsidiaries were required to pay a $ 2.5 million civil money penalty to the CFPB. As required by the consent order, on October 19, 2015, the Discover Subsidiaries submitted to the CFPB a redress plan and a compliance plan designed to ensure that the Discover Subsidiaries provide redress and otherwise comply with the terms of the order. The CFPB is currently investigating Discover Bank&#8217;s compliance with the order and certain student loan servicing practices. Discover Bank is cooperating with the CFPB in connection with the investigation. Discover Bank is enhancing the compliance plan submitted to the CFPB in 2015. The investigation could lead to a supervisory action, which may result in legal fees, penalties, fines and remediation expenses, and could require Discover Bank to change certain business practices. 

On March 8, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, other credit card networks, other issuing banks, and EMVCo in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (B&#38;R Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milam&#8217;s Market, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et al.) alleging a conspiracy by defendants to shift fraud liability to merchants with the migration to the EMV security standard and chip technology. Plaintiffs assert joint and several liability among the defendants and seek unspecified damages, including treble damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs and injunctive relief. In May 2017, the Court entered an order transferring the entire action to a federal court in New York that is presiding over certain related claims that are pending in the actions consolidated as MDL 1720. On March 11, 2018, the Court entered an order denying the plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification without prejudice to filing a renewed motion. Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification on July 16, 2018. Defendants filed their Opposition to Class Certification on March 15, 2019; a hearing date is yet to be scheduled. The Company is not in a position at this time to assess the likely outcome or its exposure, if any, with respect to this matter, but will seek to vigorously defend against all claims asserted by the plaintiffs . 

On September 20, 2019, a putative class action was filed against the Company in the Northern District of Illinois (Bonoan v. Discover Financial Services) alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiff alleges the Company placed telephone calls to wrong or reassigned cellular telephone numbers without consent. The plaintiff seeks an injunction, statutory damages, treble damages, reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses. The case was dismissed on November 8, 2019.

Fair Value Measurements 

##TABLE_END Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , provides a three-level hierarchy for classifying financial instruments, which is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of each financial instrument are observable or unobservable. It also requires certain disclosures about those measurements. The three-level valuation hierarchy is as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1 : Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs are defined as those that utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2 : Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs are those that utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets, quoted prices for the identical assets in an inactive market, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. The Company evaluates factors such as the frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and the significance of adjustments made when considering transactions involving similar assets or liabilities to assess the relevance of those observed prices. If relevant and observable prices are available, the fair values of the related assets or liabilities would be classified as Level 2. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3 : Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are those based on unobservable inputs and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability being valued. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company may utilize both observable and unobservable inputs in determining the fair values of financial instruments classified within the Level 3 category. 

##TABLE_END The determination of classification of its financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy is performed at least quarterly by the Company. For transfers in and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy, the Company discloses the fair value measurement based on the value immediately preceding the transfer. 

The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and involves consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability. Furthermore, certain techniques used to measure fair value involve some degree of judgment and, as a result, are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.

Available-for-Sale Investment Securities 

Investment securities classified as available-for-sale consist of U.S. Treasury securities and residential mortgage-backed securities. The fair value estimates of investment securities classified as Level 1, consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, are determined based on quoted market prices for the same securities. The Company classifies residential mortgage-backed securities as Level 2, the fair value estimates of which are based on the best information available. This data may consist of observed market prices, broker quotes or discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions such as benchmark yields, issuer spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings and losses, the priority of which may vary based on availability of information. 

The Company validates the fair value estimates provided by pricing services primarily by comparison to valuations obtained through other pricing sources. The Company evaluates pricing variances amongst different pricing sources to ensure that the valuations utilized are reasonable. The Company also corroborates the reasonableness of the fair value estimates with analysis of trends of significant inputs, such as market interest rate curves. The Company further performs due diligence in understanding the procedures and techniques performed by the pricing services to derive fair value estimates. 

At December 31, 2019 , amounts reported in residential mortgage-backed securities reflect government-rated obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae with a par value of $ 408 million , a weighted-average coupon of 2.81 % and a weighted-average remaining maturity of three years . 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. These instruments are classified as Level 2 as their fair values are estimated using proprietary pricing models, containing certain assumptions based on readily observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, option volatility and foreign currency forward and spot rates. In determining fair values, the pricing models use widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and the observable market-based inputs. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from the observable market interest rate curves. The Company considers collateral and master netting agreements that mitigate credit exposure to counterparties in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. The fair values of the currency instruments are valued comparing the contracted forward exchange rate pertaining to the specific contract maturities to the current market exchange rate. 

The Company validates the fair value estimates of interest rate swaps primarily through comparison to the fair value estimates computed by the counterparties to each of the derivative transactions. The Company evaluates pricing variances amongst different pricing sources to ensure that the valuations utilized are reasonable. The Company also corroborates the reasonableness of the fair value estimates with analysis of trends of significant inputs, such as market interest rate curves. The Company performs due diligence in understanding the impact to any changes to the valuation techniques performed by proprietary pricing models prior to implementation, working closely with the third-party valuation service, and reviews the control objectives of the service at least annually. The Company corroborates the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts through independent calculation of the fair value estimates. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

The Company also has assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets include those associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible assets. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to the initial recognition of the assets is applicable if one or more of the assets is determined to be impaired. The Company had no material impairments related to these assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

##TABLE_END The Company uses derivatives to manage its exposure to various financial risks. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Certain derivatives used to manage the Company&#8217;s exposure to foreign currency are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. 

Derivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which generally is addressed through collateral arrangements as described under the sub-heading &#8220;&#8212; Collateral Requirements and Credit-Risk Related Contingency Features.&#8221; The Company enters into derivative transactions with established dealers that meet minimum credit criteria established by the Company. All counterparties must be pre-approved prior to engaging in any transaction with the Company. Counterparties are monitored on a regular basis by the Company to ensure compliance with the Company&#8217;s risk policies and limits. In determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment for the fair values of derivatives, the Company considers collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate credit exposure to related counterparties. 

All derivatives are recorded in other assets at their gross positive fair values and in accrued expenses and other liabilities at their gross negative fair values. See Note 20: Fair Value Measurements for a description of the valuation methodologies of derivatives. Cash collateral amounts associated with derivative positions that are cleared through an exchange are legally characterized as settlement of the derivative positions. Such collateral amounts are reflected as 

- 129 - 

offsets to the associated derivatives balances recorded in other assets or in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Other cash collateral posted and held balances are recorded in other assets and deposits, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Collateral amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition are based on the net collateral posted or held position for each applicable legal entity&#8217;s master netting arrangement with each counterparty. 

Derivatives Designated as Hedges 

Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows arising from changes in interest rates, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates related to future cash flows resulting from interest payments on credit card securitized debt and deposits. The Company&#8217;s outstanding cash flow hedges are for an initial maximum period of seven years for deposits. The derivatives are designated as hedges of the risk of changes in cash flows on the Company&#8217;s Federal Funds rate-based interest payments, and qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (&#8220;ASC 815&#8221;). 

The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted cash flows affect earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives at December 31, 2019 will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are accrued on certain of the Company&#8217;s floating-rate securitized debt and deposits. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates it will reclassify $ 5 million of pretax expense to interest expense related to its derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The Company is exposed to changes in fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations due to changes in interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value of certain fixed-rate long-term borrowings, including securitized debt and bank notes, attributable to changes in LIBOR or OIS rate, benchmark interest rates as defined by ASC 815. These interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with ASC 815. Changes in both (i) the fair values of the derivatives and (ii) the hedged long-term borrowings and deposits relating to the risk being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The changes generally provide substantial offset to one another, with any difference in interest expense. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts 

The Company has foreign exchange forward contracts that are economic hedges and are not designated as accounting hedges. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income. 

Derivatives Cleared Through an Exchange 

The legal characterization of cash variation margin payments on derivatives cleared through an exchange are legally considered settlement payments and are accounted for with corresponding derivative positions as one unit of account and not separately as collateral. With settlement payments on derivative positions cleared through this exchange reflected as offsets to the associated derivative asset and liability balances, the fair values of derivative instruments and collateral balances shown are generally reduced.

Collateral Requirements and Credit-Risk Related Contingency Features 

The Company has master netting arrangements and minimum collateral posting thresholds with its counterparties for its fair value and cash flow hedge interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company has not sought a legal opinion in relation to the enforceability of its master netting arrangements and, as such, does not report any of these positions on a net basis. Collateral is required by either the Company or its subsidiaries or the counterparty depending on the net fair value position of these derivatives held with that counterparty. The Company may also be required to post collateral with a counterparty for its fair value and cash flow hedge interest rate swaps depending on the credit rating it or Discover Bank receives from specified major credit rating agencies. These collateral receivable or payable amounts are generally not offset against the fair value of these derivatives, but are recorded separately in other assets or deposits. Most of the Company&#8217;s cash collateral amounts relate to positions cleared through an exchange and are reflected as offsets to the associated derivatives balances recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities. 

At December 31, 2019 , Discover Bank&#8217;s credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties. However, if its credit rating is reduced below investment grade, Discover Bank would be required to post additional collateral. The amount of additional collateral as of December 31, 2019 would have been $ 20 million . DFS (Parent Company) had no outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2019 , and therefore, no collateral was required. 

The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.

##TABLE_START 22. 

Segment Disclosures 

##TABLE_END The Company&#8217;s business activities are managed in two segments: Direct Banking and Payment Services. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Direct Banking: The Direct Banking segment includes Discover-branded credit cards issued to individuals on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans, and other consumer lending and deposit products. The majority of Direct Banking revenues relate to interest income earned on the segment&#8217;s loan products. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s credit card products generate substantially all revenues related to discount and interchange, protection products and loan fee income. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Payment Services: The Payment Services segment includes PULSE, an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and the Company&#8217;s Network Partners business, which provides payment transaction processing and settlement services on the Discover Network. The majority of Payment Services revenues relate to transaction processing revenue from PULSE and royalty and licensee revenue from Diners Club. 

##TABLE_END The business segment reporting provided to and used by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker is prepared using the following principles and allocation conventions: 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Through its operation of the Discover Network, the Direct Banking segment incurs fixed marketing, servicing and infrastructure costs that are not specifically allocated among the segments, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Company&#8217;s Payment Services segment. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The assets of the Company are not allocated among the operating segments in the information reviewed by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

##TABLE_END ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;), generally applies to the sales of any good or service for which no other specific accounting guidance is provided. ASC 606 defines a principles-based model under which revenue from a contract is allocated to the distinct performance obligations within the contract and recognized in income as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company&#8217;s revenue that is subject to this model includes discount and interchange, protection products fees, transaction processing revenue, and amounts classified as other income.
