Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Discover Financial Services (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of financial condition, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 

Discover Financial Services 

Riverwoods, IL 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Discover Financial Services (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#8212; Credit Card Loans, Private Student Loans, and Personal Loans &#8212; Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;allowance&#8221;) represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining life of each loan, using relevant available information, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. As of December 31, 2023, the total allowance was $9.3 billion, which includes the allowance associated with the credit card loan, private student loan and personal loan portfolios of $7.6 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.7 billion, respectively. 

The determination of the allowance estimate involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires significant estimates of current credit risk using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Management uses statistical models, which are 

developed on the historical relationship between losses and predictive variables, to estimate the quantitative component of the allowance. The statistical models require that management select certain inputs for each estimate, including the macroeconomic forecast scenario, and the reasonable and supportable forecast period. In addition, management considers relevant qualitative factors that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the model estimate. 

Auditing certain aspects of the allowance associated with the credit card loan, private student loan, and personal loan portfolios required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our credit modeling specialists. This included evaluating the (1) model methodology, including the selection of predictive variables during model development, (2) selection of key model assumptions, including the macroeconomic forecast scenario and reasonable and supportable period, and (3) qualitative analysis of the results, including the use of qualitative adjustments, if applicable. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses balance, specific to the credit card loan, private student loan, and personal loan portfolios included the following procedures, among others: 

&#8226; We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the determination and review of model methodology, selection of key model assumptions, and qualitative analysis of the results 

&#8226; We evaluated whether the methodology and key model assumptions are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework 

&#8226; With assistance from credit modeling specialists, we evaluated whether the models are suitable for determining the estimate, which included understanding the model methodologies and logic and whether the selected methods for estimating loan losses is appropriate for each loan portfolio 

&#8226; We evaluated whether the selected macroeconomic forecasts were reasonable, including evaluating if they were internally consistent with other aspects of the Company&#8217;s operations, and externally consistent with other macroeconomic forecasts 

&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness and consistency of the reasonable and supportable forecast period 

&#8226; We evaluated whether judgments have been applied consistently to the models and that any qualitative adjustments are consistent with the measurement objective of the applicable financial reporting framework and are appropriate in the circumstances 

&#8226; We considered any contradictory evidence that arose while performing our procedures, and whether or not this evidence was indicative of management bias 

&#8226; We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses disclosures 

Litigation and Regulatory Matters &#8212; Card Product Misclassification Refund Liability &#8212; Refer to Note 19 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

Beginning in 2007, the Company incorrectly classified certain credit card accounts into its highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. The misclassification affected pricing for certain merchants and merchant acquirers, but not for cardholders. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a liability of $375 million within accrued expenses and other liabilities to provide refunds to merchant and merchant acquirers as a result of the card product misclassification. 

The Company used facts and data available as of December 31, 2023, to develop its best estimate for the amount of refunds it expects to pay to merchant and merchant acquirers. The determination of the liability involved management judgment and estimation as a result of differences in individual merchant agreements, changes in network terms and availability of historical data. 

We identified the refund liability as a critical audit matter because auditing management&#8217;s judgment in determining the methodology for the liability calculation and assumptions applied within the calculation required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the card misclassification refund liability included the following procedures, among others: 

&#8226; We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the determination and review of the liability calculation and assumptions used in the calculation 

&#8226; We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used within the calculation 

&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of the methodology used to calculate the liability which included evaluating the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, the application of the data inputs to the calculation, and assumptions used within the calculation 

&#8226; We inspected meeting minutes for the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, Risk Oversight Committee, and Governance and Controls Committee 

&#8226; We performed inquiries with members of management regarding the refund liability 

&#8226; We inspected supporting documentation and inquired of members of management regarding the status of any ongoing regulatory reviews specific to the refund liability or settlement negotiations 

&#8226; We considered any contradictory evidence that arose while performing our procedures, and whether or not this evidence was indicative of management bias 

&#8226; We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the refund liability

1. Background and Basis of Presentation 

Description of Business 

Discover Financial Services (&#8220;DFS&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a digital banking and payment services company. The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Therefore, the Company is subject to oversight, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Company provides digital banking products and services and payment services through its subsidiaries. The Company offers its customers credit card loans, personal loans, home loans and deposit products. The Company also operates the Discover Network, the PULSE network (&#8220;PULSE&#8221;) and Diners Club International (&#8220;Diners Club&#8221;), collectively known as the Discover Global Network. The Discover Network processes transactions for Discover-branded credit and debit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;) domestically and internationally, as well as merchant acceptance throughout the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded credit and charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. 

The Company manages its business activities in two segments, Digital Banking and Payment Services, based on the products and services provided. See Note 22: Segment Disclosures for a detailed description of each segment&#8217;s operations and the allocation conventions used in business segment reporting. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or changes in stockholders&#8217; equity. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company&#8217;s policy is to consolidate all entities in which it owns more than 50 % of the outstanding voting stock unless it does not control the entity. However, the Company did not have a controlling voting interest in any entity other than its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

It is also the Company&#8217;s policy to consolidate any VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as defined by GAAP. On this basis, the Company consolidates the Discover Card Master Trust I (&#8220;DCMT&#8221;) and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (&#8220;DCENT&#8221;) as well as the student loan securitization trust. The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each of these trusts since it is, for each, the trust Servicer and the holder of both the residual interest and the majority of the most subordinated interests. Because of those involvements, the Company has, for each trust, (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust and (ii) the obligation (or right) to absorb losses (or receive benefits) of the trust that could potentially be significant. The Company has determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any other VIE during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 

For investments in any entities in which the Company owns 50 % or less of the outstanding voting stock but in which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, the Company applies the equity method of accounting. The Company also applies the equity method to its investments in qualified affordable housing projects and similar tax credit partnerships. In cases where the Company&#8217;s equity investment is less than 20 % and significant influence does not exist, such investments are carried at cost as they typically do not have readily 

determinable fair values, and are adjusted for any impairment in value. Investments in actively traded stock are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as an adjustment to earnings. 

Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements 

As reported in the second quarter of 2023, beginning in 2007, the Company incorrectly classified certain credit card accounts into its highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. The Company determined the revenue impact of the incorrect card product classification was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all impacted prior periods. For comparative purposes, the Company has made these corrections to the consolidated financial statements for the prior periods presented in this Form 10-K. Additionally, prior period amounts in the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements have been corrected. The impacts of the misclassification and subsequent corrections are contained entirely within the Digital Banking segment. See Note 26: Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements for additional information and quantification of the prior period restatement impacts. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Not Yet Adopted) 

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This ASU enhances the transparency of income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. Entities are required to disaggregate the rate reconciliation (including percentages and reported amounts) by certain specified categories with additional disaggregation by nature and/or jurisdiction for items over a designated threshold. Income taxes paid (net of refunds received) must be disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes and separately by individual jurisdiction in which that amount for a particular jurisdiction is equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). This annual disclosure guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2025 and requires prospective application. Retrospective application is also permitted. Management will consider which method is appropriate for the Company. While the ASU implements further income tax disclosure requirements, it does not change how an entity determines its income tax obligation, and it will have no impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The ASU requires disclosure of additional segment level information, particularly regarding significant segment expenses. Entities must disclose significant expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) and included in the reported segment measure of profit or loss. Other segment items must also be reported, which are those items that make up the difference between segment revenues less significant segment expenses and reported segment profit or loss. Additionally, entities must disclose the identity of the CODM and how they use the reported measures of segment profit or loss for decision making and assessing segment performance. The guidance is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2024, and interim periods thereafter and requires retrospective application. While the ASU implements further segment disclosure requirements, it does not change how an entity identifies its operating or reportable segments, and it will have no impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments&#8212;Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expands the use of the proportional amortization method of accounting for tax credit investments. Currently, the method is limited to Low Income Housing Tax Credit investments. Under the amended guidance, use of proportional amortization will be available to any qualifying tax credit investments, including but not limited to investments in New Markets Tax Credit and Renewable Energy Tax Credit programs. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2024. The Company will elect the proportional amortization method for any of its qualifying tax credit investments. Management has chosen a modified-retrospective application, meaning a cumulative-effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date without adjusting comparative periods. Management determined that the standard will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . The ASU eliminated the troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") recognition and measurement guidance and enhanced disclosures for modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing 

financial difficulty. Under ASU 2022-02, the use of a discounted cash flow method is no longer required when measuring expected credit losses on modified loans. The ASU also refined existing credit-related disclosures by requiring disclosure of current-period gross charge-offs of receivables by year of origination. The amendments in the ASU were applied prospectively to modifications and disclosures of gross charge-offs; however, adoption on a modified retrospective basis was applied for the effect on the allowance for credit losses related to the elimination of the TDR recognition and measurement guidance. The ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce the beginning balance of its allowance for credit losses by $ 68 million to reflect the elimination of the measurement guidance related to TDRs with an offsetting increase, net of tax, to beginning retained earnings. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents is defined by the Company as cash on deposit with banks, including time deposits and other highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased, excluding amounts restricted by certain contractual or other obligations. Cash and cash equivalents included $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.5 billion of cash and due from banks and $ 9.7 billion and $ 7.4 billion of interest-earning deposits at other banks at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Restricted Cash 

Restricted cash includes cash in accounts from which the Company&#8217;s ability to withdraw funds at any time is contractually limited. Restricted cash is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations. 

Investment Securities 

At December 31, 2023, investment securities consisted of debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury and government-sponsored enterprises of the U.S. (&#8220;U.S. GSEs&#8221;) and mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies or U.S. GSEs. Investment securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost. All other investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, as the Company does not hold investment securities for trading purposes. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) included in stockholders&#8217; equity. The Company estimates the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities as more fully discussed in Note 20: Fair Value Measurements. The amortized cost for each held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment security is adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts, as appropriate. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income. Interest on investment securities is accrued each month in accordance with their contractual terms and recorded in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSE obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies or U.S. GSEs in which the Company invests have long histories with no credit losses and are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. Therefore, management has concluded that there is no expectation of non-payment on its investment securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on these investments. 

Loan Receivables 

Loan receivables consist of credit card receivables and other loan receivables. The carrying values of all classes of loan receivables include unamortized net deferred loan origination fees and costs (also see &#8220;&#8212; Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies &#8212; Loan Interest and Fee Income&#8221;). The credit card loan receivables carrying amount includes the principal amounts outstanding and uncollected billed interest and fees and is reduced for unearned revenue related to balance transfer fees (also see &#8220;&#8212; Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies &#8212; Loan Interest and Fee Income&#8221;). Other loans consist of private student loans, personal loans and other loans and the carrying amount of those loans includes principal amounts outstanding. For private student loans, principal amounts outstanding also include accrued interest that has been capitalized. The Company&#8217;s loan receivables are deemed to be held-for-investment at origination or acquisition because management has the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future. Cash flows associated with loans originated or acquired for investment are classified as cash flows from investing activities, regardless of a subsequent change in intent. 

Delinquent Loans and Net Charge-Offs 

The entire balance of an account is contractually past due if the minimum payment is not received by the specified date on the customer&#8217;s billing statement. Delinquency is reported on loans that are 30 days or more past due. 

Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days past due. Closed-end unsecured consumer loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past due. Customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off by the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but not later than the 180 -day or 120 -day time frame described above. Receivables associated with alleged or potential fraudulent transactions are reserved for at their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of such fraud through a charge to other expense and are subsequently written off at the end of the month 90 days following notification, but not later than the contractual 180 -day or 120 -day time frame described above. The Company&#8217;s charge-off policies are designed to comply with guidelines established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;). 

The Company&#8217;s net charge-offs include the principal amount of loans charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. 

The practice of re-aging an account also may affect loan delinquencies and charge-offs. A re-age is intended to assist delinquent customers who have experienced financial difficulties but who demonstrate both an ability and willingness to repay. Accounts meeting specific criteria are re-aged when the Company and the customer agree on a temporary repayment schedule that may include concessionary terms. With re-aging, the outstanding balance of a delinquent account is returned to a current status. Customers may also qualify for a workout re-age when either a longer term or permanent hardship exists. The Company&#8217;s re-age practices are designed to comply with FFIEC guidelines. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level that is appropriate to absorb net credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of expected credit losses considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees associated with the Company's loan receivables existing as of the balance sheet date. Additionally, the estimate includes expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off. The allowance is evaluated quarterly for appropriateness and is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs of principal amounts of loans outstanding are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries of such amounts increase the allowance. Charge-offs of loan balances representing unpaid interest and fees result in a reversal of interest and fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses. 

The Company calculates its allowance for credit losses by estimating expected credit losses separately for classes of receivables with similar risk characteristics. This results in segmenting the portfolio by loan product type, which is the level that the Company develops and documents its methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses for each loan product type is based on: (i) a reasonable and supportable forecast period; (ii) a reversion period; and (iii) a post-reversion period based on historical information covering the remaining life of the loan, all of which is netted with expected recoveries. The lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts. The Company applies a weighted approach in reverting from the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the post-reversion period. 

Several analyses are used to help estimate credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables as of the balance sheet date. The Company's estimation process includes models that predict customer losses based on risk characteristics and portfolio attributes, macroeconomic variables and historical data and analysis. There is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. 

For credit card loans, the Company uses a modeling framework that includes the following components for estimating expected credit losses: 

&#8226; Probability of default: this component estimates the probability of charge-off at different points in time over the life of each loan. 

&#8226; Exposure at default: this component estimates the balance on the loan at the time of default. Given that there is no stated life of a receivable balance on a revolving credit card account, the Company applies a percentage of expected payments to estimate the balance that would remain at the time of charge-off. 

&#8226; Recoveries from charged-off accounts are estimated separately and are netted as part of the aggregation of all of the components of the card loss modeling framework. 

&#8226; The output of the above three components is adjusted to remove post measurement date activity. 

For private student loans and personal loans, the Company uses vintage-based models that estimate expected credit losses over the life of the loan, net of recovery estimates, impacted mainly by time elapsed since origination, credit quality of origination vintages and macroeconomic forecasts. 

The components described above for credit card, private student and personal loans are developed utilizing historical data and applicable macroeconomic variable inputs based on statistical analysis and customer behavioral relationships with credit performance. Expected recoveries from loans charged off as of the balance sheet date are modeled separately and included in the allowance estimate. The Company leverages these models and recent macroeconomic forecasts for the portion of the estimate associated with the reasonable and supportable forecast period. To estimate expected credit losses for the remainder of the life of the credit card loans, the Company reverts to historical experience of credit card loans with characteristics similar to those as of the balance sheet date and observed over various phases of a credit cycle. To estimate expected credit losses for the remainder of the life of private student and personal loans, the Company generally reverts to use of average macroeconomic variables over an appropriate historical period. 

The considerations in these models include past and current loan performance, loan growth and seasoning, risk management practices, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes and forecasting uncertainties. Consideration of past and current loan performance includes the post-modification performance of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For the credit card loan portfolio, the Company estimates its credit losses on a loan-level basis, which includes loans that are delinquent and/or no longer accruing interest and/or loans that have been restructured. For the remainder of its portfolio, including private student, personal and other loans, the Company estimates its credit losses on a pooled basis. For all loan types, recoveries are estimated at a pooled level based on estimates of future cash flows derived using historical experience. 

Accrued interest receivable on credit card loans is included in the estimate of expected credit losses once billed to the customer (i.e., once the interest becomes part of the loan balance). Except as noted in the following sentence, an allowance for credit losses is not recorded for unbilled credit card interest or accrued interest receivable on other loan classes as the impact to the allowance for credit losses is not material. Accrued interest receivable on student loans that have not yet entered repayment is included in the estimate of expected credit losses. 

No liability for expected credit losses is required for unused lines of credit on the Company&#8217;s credit card loans because they are unconditionally cancellable. The Company records a liability for expected credit losses for unfunded commitments on all other loans, which is presented as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. This liability is evaluated quarterly for appropriateness and is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for credit losses. 

As part of certain collection strategies, the Company may modify the terms of loans to customers experiencing financial hardship. Temporary and permanent modifications on credit card and personal loans, as well as temporary modifications on private student loans and certain grants of private student loan forbearance are generally subject to disclosure as loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

Loan receivables that have been modified are subject to the same requirements for the accrual of expected credit loss over their expected remaining lives as described above for unmodified loans. The effects of all loan modifications, whether or not they are subject to disclosure as loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, are reflected in the allowance for credit losses. 

Premises and Equipment, net 

Premises and equipment, net, are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and accumulated depreciation and amortization. Accumulated depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives and may adjust them as necessary. Buildings are depreciated over a period of thirty-nine years . The costs of improvements are capitalized and depreciated either over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life, typically ten years to fifteen years , or over the remaining term of the lease, when applicable. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a period of five years to ten years . Equipment is depreciated over three years to ten years . Maintenance and repairs are immediately expensed when incurred, while the costs of significant improvements are capitalized. 

Purchased software and capitalized costs related to internally developed software are amortized over their useful lives of three years to ten years . Costs incurred during the application development stage related to internally developed software are capitalized. Costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage. Once the capitalization criteria as defined in GAAP have been met, external direct costs incurred for materials and services used in developing or obtaining internal-use computer software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the internal-use computer software project (to the extent those employees devoted time directly to the project) are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software is included in premises and equipment, net in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 6: Premises and Equipment for further information about the Company&#8217;s premises and equipment. 

Cloud computing arrangements involving the licensing of software that meet certain criteria are recognized as the acquisition of software. Such assets are measured at the present value of the license obligation, if the license is to be paid over time, in addition to any capitalized upfront costs and amortized over the life of the arrangement. Cloud computing arrangements that do not meet the criteria to be recognized as acquired software are accounted for as service contracts. To date, no ne of the Company&#8217;s cloud computing arrangements have met the criteria to be recognized as acquired software. 

Premises and equipment are subject to impairment testing when events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable from future cash flows. A test for recoverability is done by comparing the asset&#8217;s carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted future net cash inflows expected to be generated from the use of the asset over its remaining useful life. Impairment exists if the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash inflows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment would result in a write-down of the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of these assets are based on the discounted present value of the stream of future net cash inflows expected to be derived over the remaining useful lives of the assets. If an impairment write-down is recorded, the remaining useful life of the asset will be evaluated to determine whether revision of the remaining amortization or depreciation period is appropriate. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is recorded as part of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company&#8217;s goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test at the reporting unit level annually as of October 1, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company&#8217;s reported goodwill relates to PULSE, which it acquired in 2005. The Company&#8217;s goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. No impairment was identified during the impairment test conducted as of October 1, 2023. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The Company measures the cost of services received from employees and non-employee directors in exchange for an award of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period. Awards to employees who are retirement-eligible at any point during the year are amortized over 12 months in accordance with the vesting terms that apply under those circumstances. No compensation cost is recognized for awards that are subsequently forfeited. 

Advertising Costs 

The Company expenses television and radio advertising costs in the period in which the advertising is first aired and all other advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are recorded in marketing and business development and were $ 359 million, $ 307 million and $ 262 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized when their realization is determined to be more likely than not. A valuation allowance is provided if the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances and which causes a change in management&#8217;s judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in the current tax provision. Uncertain tax positions are measured at the highest amount of tax benefit for which realization is judged to be more likely than not. Tax benefits that do not meet these criteria are unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes and reports interest and penalties, if necessary, related to uncertain tax positions within its provision for income tax expense. See Note 15: Income Taxes for more information about the Company&#8217;s income taxes. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 

The Company records unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges and certain pension and foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) on an after-tax basis where applicable. The Company&#8217;s policy is to adjust the tax effects of a component of AOCI in the same period in which the item is sold or otherwise derecognized, or when the carrying value of the item is remeasured. Details of OCI, net of tax, are presented in the statement of comprehensive income and a roll forward of AOCI is presented in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and Note 13: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. 

Significant Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies 

Loan Interest and Fee Income 

Interest on loans is composed largely of interest on credit card loans and is recognized based on the amount of loans outstanding and their contractual interest rate. Interest on credit card loans is included in loan receivables when billed to the customer. The Company accrues unbilled interest revenue each month from a customer&#8217;s billing cycle date to the end of the month. The Company applies an estimate of the percentage of loans that will revolve in the next cycle in the estimation of the accrued unbilled portion of interest revenue that is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest on other loan receivables is accrued each month in accordance with their contractual terms and recorded in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

The Company recognizes fees (except balance transfer fees and certain product fees) on loan receivables in interest income or loan fee income as the fees are assessed. Balance transfer fees and certain product fees are recognized in interest income or loan fee income ratably over the periods to which they relate. Balance transfer fees are accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the related balance. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenues related to balance transfer fees, recorded as a reduction of loan receivables, were $ 107 million and $ 85 million, respectively. Loan fee income consists of fees on credit card loans and includes late, cash advance, returned check and other miscellaneous fees and is reflected net of waivers and charge-offs. 

Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one year period and recorded in interest income from credit card loans. Direct loan origination costs on other loan receivables are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan using the interest method and are recorded in interest income from other loans. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the remaining unamortized deferred costs related to loan origination were $ 306 million and $ 298 million, respectively, and were recorded in loan receivables. 

The Company accrues interest and fees on credit card and closed-end loan receivables until the loans are paid or charged off, except in instances of customer bankruptcy, death or suspected fraud, where no further interest and fee accruals occur following notification. Upon completion of the fraud investigation, non-fraudulent credit card and closed-end consumer loan receivables may resume accruing interest. Payments received on non-accrual loans are allocated 

according to the same payment hierarchy applied to loans that are accruing interest. When loan receivables are charged off, unpaid accrued interest and fees are reversed against the income line items in which they were originally recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Charge-offs and recoveries of amounts that relate to capitalized interest on private student loans are treated as principal charge-offs and recoveries, affecting the provision for credit losses rather than interest income. The Company considers uncollectible interest and fee revenues in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. 

Interest income from loans disclosed as modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy applied to loans that have not been modified. 

Discount and Interchange Revenue 

The Company earns discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom it has entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. The Company earns acquirer interchange revenue primarily from merchant acquirers on Discover Network, Diners Club and PULSE transactions made by credit and debit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing payment card transactions. These card acceptance arrangements generally renew automatically and do not have fixed durations. Under these agreements, the Company stands ready to process payment transactions as and when each is presented. The Company earns discount, interchange and similar fees only when transactions are processed. Contractually defined per-transaction fee amounts typically apply to each type of transaction processed and are recognized as revenue at the time each transaction is captured for settlement. These fees are typically collected by the Company as part of the process of settling transactions daily with merchants and acquirers and are fully earned at the time settlement is made. 

The Company pays issuer interchange to card-issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network and on certain transactions on the Diners Club and PULSE networks. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card-issuing organization&#8217;s transaction volume. The Company classifies this cost as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue. Costs of cardholder reward arrangements, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, are classified as reductions of discount and interchange revenue pursuant to guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 606 governing consideration payable to a customer. For both issuer interchange and transaction-based cardholder rewards, the Company accrues the cost at the time each underlying card transaction is captured for settlement. 

Customer Rewards 

The Company offers its customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their credit card purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer&#8217;s purchases. The liability for customer rewards is recorded on an individual customer basis and is accumulated as qualified customers earn rewards through their ongoing credit card purchase activity or other defined actions. The Company recognizes customer rewards costs as a reduction of the related revenue, if any. In instances where a reward is not associated with a revenue-generating transaction, such as when a reward is given for opening an account, the reward cost is recorded as an operating expense. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, rewards costs amounted to $ 3.1 billion, $ 3.0 billion and $ 2.5 billion, respectively. The liability for customer rewards was $ 2.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Protection Products Revenue 

The Company earns revenue related to fees received for providing ancillary products and services, including payment protection and identity theft protection services, to its credit card customers. A portion of this revenue comprises amounts earned for arranging for the delivery of products offered by third-party service providers. The amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customer&#8217;s outstanding balance or a flat fee, in either case assessed monthly and recognized as earned. These contracts are month-to-month arrangements that are cancellable at any time. The Company recognizes each monthly fee in the period to which the service or coverage relates. 

Transaction Processing Revenue 

Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants under network participation agreements for processing ATM and debit transactions over the PULSE network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Network participation agreements generally renew automatically and do not have fixed durations, although the Company does enter into fixed-term pricing or incentive arrangements with certain network participants. Similar to discount and interchange fees, switch fees are contractually defined per-transaction fee amounts and are assessed and recognized as revenue at the time each transaction is captured for settlement. These fees are typically collected by the Company as part of the process of settling transactions with network participants. Membership and other participation fees are recognized over the periods to which each fee relates. 

Other Income 

Other income includes gains and losses on equity investments, sales-based royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, merchant fees, revenues from network partners and other miscellaneous revenue items. Unrealized gains and losses on equity investments carried at fair value are recognized quarterly based on changes in their respective fair values. Sales-based royalty revenues are recognized as the related sales are reported by Diners franchisees. All remaining items of other income are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied. 

Future Revenue Associated with Customer Contracts 

For contracts under which the Company processes payment card transactions, the Company has the right to assess fees for services performed and to collect those fees through the settlement process. The Company generates essentially all of its discount and interchange revenue and transaction processing revenue, as well as some revenue reported as other income, through such contracts. There is no specified quantity of service promised in these contracts as the number of payment transactions is dependent upon cardholder behavior, which is outside the control of the Company and its network customers (i.e., merchants, acquirers, issuers and other network participants). As noted above, these contracts are typically without fixed durations and renew automatically. For these reasons, the Company does not make or disclose an estimate of revenue associated with performance obligations attributable to the remaining terms of these contracts. Future revenue associated with the Company&#8217;s sales-based royalty revenues earned from Diners Club licensees is similarly variable and open-ended and therefore the Company does not make or disclose an estimate of royalties associated with performance obligations attributable to the remaining terms of the licensing and royalty arrangements. Because of the nature of the services and the manner of collection associated with the majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue from contracts with customers, material receivables or deferred revenues are not generated. 

Incentive Payments 

The Company makes certain incentive payments under contractual arrangements with financial institutions, Diners Club licensees, merchants, acquirers and certain other customers. These payments are generally classified as contra-revenue unless a distinct good or service is received by the Company in exchange for the payment and the fair value of the good or service can be reasonably estimated. If no such good or service is identified, then the entire payment is classified as contra-revenue and included in the consolidated statements of income in the line item where the related revenues are recorded. If the payment gives rise to an asset because it is expected to directly or indirectly contribute to future net cash inflows, it is deferred and recognized over the expected benefit period. The unamortized portion of the deferred incentive payments included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition was $ 27 million and $ 32 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company invests in U.S. Treasury obligations and securities issued by government agencies or U.S. GSEs, which have long histories with no credit losses and are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. federal government. Therefore, management has concluded that there is no expectation of non-payment on its investment securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on these investments. In addition, the Company does not have the intent to sell any available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position and does not believe it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell any such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. 

The following table provides information about available-for-sale investment securities with aggregate gross unrealized losses and the length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Less than 12 months More than 12 months Number of Securities in a Loss Position Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses December 31, 2023 Available-for-Sale Investment Securities U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSE securities 105 &#160; $ 3,513 &#160; $ ( 13 ) $ 3,978 &#160; $ ( 73 ) Residential mortgage-backed securities - Agency 31 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 465 &#160; $ ( 15 ) December 31, 2022 Available-for-Sale Investment Securities U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSE securities 123 &#160; $ 9,060 &#160; $ ( 175 ) $ 106 &#160; $ ( 3 ) Residential mortgage-backed securities - Agency 34 &#160; $ 559 &#160; $ ( 22 ) $ 5 &#160; $ ( 1 ) ##TABLE_END

Other Investments 

As a part of the Company&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives, the Company has made equity investments in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing and stimulate economic development in low- to moderate-income communities. These investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are recorded within other assets. The related commitment for future investments is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities within the consolidated statements of financial condition. The portion of each investment&#8217;s operating results allocable to the Company reduces the carrying value of the investments and is recorded in other expense within the consolidated statements of income. The Company further reduces the carrying value of the investments by recognizing any amounts that are in excess of future net tax benefits in other expense. The Company earns a return primarily through tax credits allocated to the affordable housing projects and the community revitalization projects. The Company does not consolidate these investments as the Company does 

not have a controlling financial interest in the investee entities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had outstanding investments in these entities of $ 514 million and $ 416 million, respectively, and related contingent liabilities for unconditional and legally binding delayed equity contributions of $ 187 million and $ 111 million, respectively. Of the above outstanding equity investments, the Company had $ 456 million and $ 375 million of investments related to affordable housing projects as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which had $ 155 million and $ 100 million of related contingent liabilities for unconditional and legally binding delayed equity contributions, respectively. 

The Company holds non-controlling equity positions in several payment services entities and third-party venture capital funds, which invest in such entities. Most of the direct investments in such entities are not subject to equity method accounting because the Company does not have significant influence over the investee. The Company&#8217;s investments in third-party venture capital funds represent limited partnership interests and are accounted for under the equity method. The common or preferred equity securities that the Company holds typically do not have readily determinable fair values. As a result, these investments are carried at cost minus impairment, if any. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of these investments, which are recorded within other assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition, was $ 35 million and $ 39 million, respectively. 

The Company also holds non-controlling equity positions in payment service entities that have actively traded stock and therefore have readily determinable fair values. As a result, these investments are carried at fair value based on the quoted share prices. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying values of these investments, which are recorded within other assets on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition, were immaterial. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying values of these investments were $ 41 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an immaterial net loss on the consolidated statements of income related to these investments. The Company recognized a net loss of $ 214 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $ 423 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

4. Loan Receivables 

The Company has two loan portfolio segments: credit card loans and other loans. 

The Company&#8217;s classes of receivables within the two portfolio segments are depicted in the following table (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START December 31, 2023 2022

(1) Amounts include carrying values of $ 14.8 billion and $ 13.5 billion underlying investors&#8217; interest in trust debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 15.6 billion and $ 12.2 billion in seller&#8217;s interest at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 5: Credit Card and Private Student Loan Securitization Activities for additional information. 

(2) Unbilled accrued interest receivable on credit card loans, which is presented as part of other assets in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition, was $ 753 million and $ 611 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

(3) Accrued interest receivable on private student, personal and other loans, which is presented as part of other assets in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition, was $ 522 million, $ 69 million and $ 21 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and $ 468 million, $ 49 million and $ 11 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. 

(4) Private student loans in repayment were $ 6.3 billion and $ 6.0 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

As part of credit risk management activities, on an ongoing basis, the Company reviews information related to the performance of a customer's account with the Company and information from credit bureaus, such as FICO or other credit scores, relating to the customer's broader credit performance. The Company actively monitors key credit quality indicators, including FICO scores and delinquency status, for credit card, private student and personal loans. These indicators are important to understand the overall credit performance of the Company's customers and their ability to repay. 

FICO scores are generally obtained at the origination of the account and are refreshed monthly or quarterly thereafter to assist in predicting customer behavior. Historically, the Company has noted that accounts with FICO scores below 660 have larger delinquencies and credit losses than those with higher credit scores. 

The following table provides the distribution of the amortized cost basis (excluding accrued interest receivable presented in other assets) by the most recent FICO scores available for the Company's customers for credit card, private student and personal loan receivables (dollars in millions):

(1) Represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2020-02 on January 1, 2023, which eliminated the requirement to apply discounted cash flow measurements for certain troubled debt restructurings. 

(2) Excludes a $ 1 million, $ 10 million and $ 9 million adjustment to the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. 

The allowance for credit losses was approximately $ 9.3 billion at December 31, 2023, which reflects a $ 1.9 billion build from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022. The build in the allowance for credit losses between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by loan growth, increasing delinquencies, and macroeconomic variables impacting household cash flows. 

The allowance estimation process begins with a loss forecast that uses certain macroeconomic variables and multiple macroeconomic scenarios among its inputs. In estimating the allowance at December 31, 2023, the Company used a macroeconomic forecast that projected the following weighted average amounts: (i) unemployment rate ending 2024 at 4.17 % and, within the Company&#8217;s reasonable and supportable period, peaking at 4.26 % in the second quarter of 2025 and (ii) 1.36 % growth rate in real gross domestic product in 2024. 

In estimating expected credit losses, the Company considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior and payment trends, as well as recent and expected macroeconomic conditions, such as high consumer price inflation and the fiscal and monetary policy responses to that inflation. The Federal Reserve raised its federal funds rate target range substantially during 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023 in an effort to slow economic growth and reduce inflation. Although real GDP growth and labor market conditions have exceeded most economists&#8217; expectations this year, restrictive monetary policy, as manifested in relatively high interest rates, typically precedes weaker consumer credit conditions caused by rising unemployment as economic growth slows. Credit performance in the Company&#8217;s lending portfolios has evolved in line with its expectations this year, but may weaken if the economy fails to avert a recession in response to tighter credit conditions or other factors. The Company assessed the prospects for various macroeconomic outcomes in setting its allowance for credit losses. 

The forecast period the Company deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months for all periods presented. The 18 months reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate given the current economic conditions. For all periods presented, the Company determined that a reversion period of 12 months was appropriate for the same reason. The Company applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented. 

The net charge-offs for credit card loans, private student loans and personal loans increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to portfolio seasoning. 

Net charge-offs of principal are recorded against the allowance for credit losses, as shown in the preceding table. Information regarding net charge-offs of interest and fee revenues on credit card and other loans is as follows (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Interest and fees accrued subsequently charged off, net of recoveries (recorded as a reduction of interest income) $ 681 &#160; $ 303 &#160; $ 286 &#160; Fees accrued subsequently charged off, net of recoveries (recorded as a reduction to other income) $ 192 &#160; $ 100 &#160; $ 75 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(1) The payment status of both modified and unmodified loans is included in this table. 

(2) The Company estimates that the gross interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of non-accruing credit card loans was $ 37 million, $ 23 million and $ 28 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not separately track the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of loans. Instead, the Company estimated this amount based on customers&#8217; current balances and most recent interest rates. 

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

The Company has internal loan modification programs that provide relief to credit card, private student and personal loan borrowers who are experiencing financial hardship. The internal loan modification programs include both temporary and permanent programs, which vary by product. External loan modification programs, through third party consumer credit counseling agencies, are also available for credit card and personal loans. Those programs feature interest rate reductions, payment delays, term extensions, or a combination thereof. 

For credit card customers, the Company offers both temporary and permanent hardship programs. The temporary hardship programs consist of an interest rate reduction lasting for a period no longer than 12 months. Charging privileges on these accounts are generally suspended while in the program. However, if the customer meets certain criteria, charging privileges may be reinstated following completion of the program. 

The permanent modification program involves closing the account, changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 72 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The permanent modification program does not typically provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. The Company also makes permanent loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. These loans typically receive a reduced interest rate, typically continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. 

To assist private student loan borrowers who are experiencing temporary financial difficulties but are willing to resume making payments, the Company has offered a payment delay (in the form of hardship forbearance or temporary payment reduction), or a payment delay (in the form of a temporary payment reduction) combined with a temporary interest rate reduction. During 2023, programs were offered up to six consecutive months at one time with a lifetime usage cap, most commonly, of 12 months. 

For personal loan customers, the Company offers various payment programs, including temporary and permanent programs, in certain situations. The temporary programs normally consist of reducing the minimum payment for no longer than 12 months and, in certain circumstances, the interest rate on the loan is reduced. The permanent programs involve extending the loan term and, in certain circumstances, reducing the interest rate on the loan. The total term of the loan, including modification, may not exceed nine years . The Company also allows permanent loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, similar to the credit card customers discussed above. Payments are modified based on the new terms agreed upon with the credit counseling agency. 

In addition to the programs described above, the Company will in certain cases accept partial payment in full satisfaction of the outstanding receivable. This is a form of principal forgiveness also known as a settlement. The difference between the loan balance and the amount received in settlement is recorded as a charge-off. 

The Company monitors borrower performance after using payment programs or forbearance. The Company believes the programs are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and allowing them to make timely payments. In addition to helping customers with their credit needs, these programs are designed to maximize collections and ultimately the Company&#8217;s profitability. The Company plans to continue to use payment programs to provide relief to customers experiencing financial difficulties. 

ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, became effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The new guidance eliminated Subtopic 310-40, Troubled Debt Restructurings, and implemented enhanced disclosure requirements regarding loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new disclosures are required to be applied on a prospective basis. There will be no comparative disclosures to prior periods until such time as both periods disclosed are subject to the new guidance. 

The following table provides the period-end amortized cost basis, by modification category, of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that entered a modification program during the period (dollars in millions). Some of the loans presented in the table below may no longer be enrolled in a program at period-end: ##TABLE_START For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,

(1) Accrued interest receivable (including unbilled accrued interest receivable for credit card loans) on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which is presented as part of other assets in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, was immaterial at December 31, 2023. 

(2) Accounts that entered a credit card loan modification program include $ 408 million that were converted from revolving line-of-credit arrangements to term loans during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

(3) For settlements, the amortized cost basis is zero at period-end and therefore there is no amount reported for principal forgiveness in the table above. See financial effects table below for principal forgiveness to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

(4) The Company defines a payment delay as a temporary reduction in payments below the original contractually required payment amounts (e.g., interest only payments). The Company's credit card loan modification programs do not result in an other than insignificant delay in payment. 

(5) The Company defines term extensions as only those modifications for which the maturity date is extended beyond the original contractual maturity date by virtue of a change in terms other than a payment delay as defined above. Modifications to credit card loans are not considered term extensions because credit card loans do not have a fixed repayment term. 

The only non-cancellable commitments the Company has to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty relate to certain private student loans. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of such commitments associated with loans modified during the periods presented was immaterial. 

The following table provides information on the financial effects of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, by modification type, made during the period (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Credit card loans Weighted-average interest rate reduction 13.85 &#160; % Principal forgiven $ 121 &#160;

(2) During 2023, private student loan payment delays were offered up to six consecutive months at one time with a lifetime usage cap, most commonly, of 12 months. For personal loan payment delays, the Company limits this assistance to a life of loan maximum of 12 months. 

Loan receivables that have been modified are subject to the same requirements for the accrual of expected credit loss over their expected remaining lives as for unmodified loans. The allowance for credit losses incorporates modeling of historical loss data and thereby captures the higher risk associated with modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty based on their account attributes.

Loans that entered a modification program in any stage of delinquency but did not experience a further payment default are included in the payment status table above but are not counted as defaulted for purposes of this disclosure. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings (Prior to 2023) 

Prior to t he adoption of ASU 2022-02, the Company considered a modified loan in which a concession had been granted to the borrower to be a TDR based generally on the cumulative length of the concession period and credit quality of the borrower. Due to differences between the legacy TDR requirements and current loan modification disclosure requirements, information presented in the disclosures below is not directly comparable to the disclosures under the current guidance. 

To evaluate the primary financial effects that resulted from credit card loans entering into a TDR program during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company quantified the amount by which interest and fees were reduced during the periods. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company forgave approximately $ 29 million of interest and fees resulting from accounts entering into a credit card loan TDR program. 

The following table provides information on loans that entered a TDR program during the period (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Number of Accounts Balances Accounts that entered a TDR program during the period 

Credit card loans (1)

(1) Accounts that entered a credit card TDR program include $ 322 million that were converted from revolving line-of-credit arrangements to term loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The following table presents the carrying value of loans that experienced a default during the period that had been modified in a TDR during the 15 months preceding the end of each period (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Number of Accounts Aggregated Outstanding Balances Upon Default TDRs that subsequently defaulted

(1) For credit card loans that default from a temporary loan modification program, accounts revert back to the pre-modification terms and charging privileges remain suspended in most cases. 

(2) For credit card loans and personal loans, a customer defaults from a loan modification program after either two consecutive missed payments or at charge-off, depending on the program. The outstanding balance upon default is generally the loan balance at the end of the month prior to default. 

(3) For student loans, a customer defaults from a loan modification after they are 60 or more days delinquent. The outstanding balance upon default is generally the loan balance at the end of the month prior to default. 

Of the account balances that defaulted as shown above for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 65 %, of the total balances were charged off at the end of the month in which they defaulted from a TDR program. For the year ended December 31, 2022, for accounts that had defaulted from a TDR program and had not been subsequently charged off, the balances were included in the allowance for credit loss analysis.

5. Credit Card and Private Student Loan Securitization Activities 

The Company&#8217;s securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings and the related trusts are treated as consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. For a description of the Company&#8217;s principles of consolidation with respect to VIEs, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation. 

Credit Card Securitization Activities 

The Company accesses the term asset securitization market through DCMT and DCENT. Credit card loan receivables are transferred into DCMT and beneficial interests in DCMT are transferred into DCENT. DCENT issues debt securities to investors that are reported primarily in long-term borrowings. 

The DCENT debt structure consists of four classes of securities (DiscoverSeries Class A, B, C and D notes), with the most senior class generally receiving a triple-A rating. To issue senior, higher-rated classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower-rated or more highly subordinated classes of notes. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Discover Bank hold the subordinated classes of notes. The Company is exposed to credit risk associated with trust receivables as of the balance sheet date through the retention of these subordinated interests. The estimate of expected credit losses on trust receivables is included in the allowance for credit losses estimate. 

The Company&#8217;s retained interests in the trust&#8217;s assets, consisting of investments in DCENT notes held by subsidiaries of Discover Bank, constitute intercompany positions that are eliminated in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Upon transfer of credit card loan receivables to the trust, the receivables and certain cash flows derived from them become restricted for use in meeting obligations to the trust&#8217;s creditors. Further, the transferred credit card loan receivables are owned by the trust and are not available to the Company&#8217;s third-party creditors. The trusts have ownership of cash balances, the amounts of which are reported in restricted cash within the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. Except for the seller&#8217;s interest in trust receivables, the Company&#8217;s interests in trust assets are generally subordinate to the interests of third-party investors in trust debt and, as such, may not be realized by the Company if needed to absorb deficiencies in cash flows that are allocated to those investors. Apart from the restricted assets related to securitization activities, the investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Company&#8217;s other assets or the Company&#8217;s general credit for a shortage in cash flows. 

The carrying values of these restricted assets, which are presented on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition as relating to securitization activities, are shown in the following table (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START December 31, 2023 2022 Restricted cash $ 36 &#160; $ 33 &#160; Investors&#8217; interests held by third-party investors 11,725 &#160; 10,200 &#160; Investors&#8217; interests held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Discover Bank 3,117 &#160; 3,341 &#160; Seller&#8217;s interest 15,598 &#160; 12,220 &#160;

(1) The Company maintains its allowance for credit losses at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses associated with all loan receivables, which includes all loan receivables in the trusts. Therefore, the credit risk associated with the transferred receivables is fully reflected on the Company&#8217;s statements of financial condition in accordance with GAAP. 

The debt securities issued by the consolidated trusts are subject to credit, payment and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loan receivables. To protect investors in the securities, there are certain features or triggering events that will cause an early amortization of the debt securities, including triggers related to the impact of the performance of the trust receivables on the availability and adequacy of cash flows to meet contractual requirements. As of December 31, 2023, no economic or other early amortization events have occurred. 

The Company continues to own and service the accounts that generate the loan receivables held by the trusts. Discover Bank receives servicing fees from the trusts based on a percentage of the monthly investor principal balance outstanding. Although the fee income to Discover Bank offsets the fee expense to the trusts and thus is eliminated in consolidation, failure to service the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements could lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing income, net of related expenses. 

Private Student Loan Securitization Activities 

The Company&#8217;s private student loan trust receivables reported in loan receivables and the related debt issued by the trust reported in long-term borrowings were immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts are included, together with amounts related to the Company&#8217;s credit card securitizations, in the supplemental information about assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities, which is presented with the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. 

6. Premises and Equipment 

A summary of premises and equipment, net is as follows (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2023 2022 Land $ 37 &#160; $ 37 &#160; Buildings and improvements 605 &#160; 587 &#160; Furniture, fixtures and equipment 1,155 &#160; 1,111 &#160; Software 1,305 &#160; 1,125 &#160; Premises and equipment 3,102 &#160; 2,860 &#160; Less: accumulated depreciation ( 1,409 ) ( 1,339 ) Less: accumulated amortization of software ( 602 ) ( 518 ) Premises and equipment, net $ 1,091 &#160; $ 1,003 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Depreciation expense was $ 74 million, $ 80 million and $ 86 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized software was $ 113 million, $ 114 million and $ 103 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

7. Goodwill 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had goodwill of $ 255 million related to PULSE, which is part of the Payment Services segment. The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and 2022 and no impairments were identified. 

8. Deposits 

The Company obtains deposits from consumers directly or through affinity relationships (&#8220;direct-to-consumer deposits&#8221;). Additionally, the Company obtains deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer the Company&#8217;s deposits to their customers (&#8220;brokered deposits&#8221;). Direct-to-consumer deposit products include savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IRA savings accounts, IRA certificates of deposit and checking accounts. Brokered deposit products include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. 

Customer deposits held with Discover Bank are currently insured for up to $250,000 per account holder through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit or similar state deposit insurance regime, and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regime. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Discover Bank had approximately $ 7.0 billion and $ 8.9 billion of uninsured deposits, respectively, a portion of which comprise intercompany deposits. The decrease in uninsured deposits reported was primarily driven by leveraging technological capabilities, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, enabling improved application of deposit account ownership attributes in deriving this amount. The amounts of uninsured deposits above were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for Discover Bank&#8217;s regulatory reporting at each respective balance sheet date. 

The following table summarizes certificates of deposit in uninsured accounts and accounts that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit by time remaining until maturity (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START At December 31, 2023 Three months or less $ 146 &#160; Over three months through six months 73 &#160; Over six months through twelve months 368 &#160; Over twelve months 293 &#160; Total $ 880 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, the Company has access to both short- and long-term advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to 30 years. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had total committed borrowing capacity of $ 3.6 billion based on the amount and type of assets pledged, of which the outstanding balance was comprised of $ 1.0 billion in long-term advances. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total committed borrowing capacity of $ 2.2 billion, of which the outstanding balance was comprised solely of a $ 525 million long-term advance. These advances are presented as short- or long-term borrowings on the consolidated statements of financial condition based on the contractual maturity at origination. 

Additionally, the Company has access to committed borrowing capacity through private securitizations to support the funding of its credit card loan receivables. As of December 31, 2023, the total commitment of secured credit facilities through private providers was $ 3.5 billion, $ 750 million of which was outstanding as a short-term advance. This advance is presented as short-term borrowings on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, the total commitment of secured credit facilities through private providers was $ 3.5 billion, none of which was drawn. Access to the unused portions of the secured credit facilities is subject to the terms of the agreements with each of the providers. The secured credit facilities have various expirations in 2025. Borrowings outstanding under each facility bear interest at a margin above the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each provider. The terms of each agreement provide for a commitment fee to be paid on the unused capacity and include various affirmative and negative covenants, including performance metrics and legal requirements similar to those required to issue any term securitization transaction. 

10. Stock-Based Compensation Plans 

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans: the Discover Financial Services Omnibus Incentive Plan (&#8220;Omnibus Plan&#8221;) and the Discover Financial Services Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan (&#8220;Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan&#8221;). 

Omnibus Plan 

The Omnibus Plan, which is stockholder-approved, provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), performance stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) and other stock-based and/or cash awards (collectively, &#8220;awards&#8221;). Currently, the Company does not have any stock options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock outstanding. Effective May 11, 2023, the Discover Financial Services Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2014 Omnibus Plan&#8221;) was replaced with the Discover Financial Services 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2023 Omnibus Plan&#8221;). Subject to adjustments for certain transactions in the 2023 Omnibus Plan, the total number of shares that may be granted is 18 million shares reduced by the number of shares granted under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. Shares granted under the Omnibus Plan may be the following: (i) authorized but unissued shares and (ii) treasury shares that the Company acquires in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise. 

Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan 

The Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan, which is stockholder-approved, permits the grant of RSUs to non-employee directors. Under the Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan, the Company may issue awards of up to a total of 1 million shares of common stock to non-employee directors. Shares of stock that are issuable pursuant to the awards granted under the Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan may be one of the following: authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares that the Company acquires in the open market. Annual awards for eligible directors are calculated by dividing $ 170,000 by the fair market value of a share of stock on the date of grant and are subject to a restriction period whereby 100 % of such units shall vest in full on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or immediately prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders following the date of grant. RSUs include the right to receive dividend equivalents in the same amount and at the same time as dividends paid to all Company common shareholders. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The following table details the compensation cost, net of forfeitures (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 RSUs $ 69 &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ 46 &#160;

(1) Unvested RSUs represent awards where recipients have yet to satisfy either explicit vesting terms or retirement-eligibility requirements. 

Compensation cost associated with RSUs is determined based on the number of units granted and the fair value on the date of grant. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The requisite service period is generally the vesting period. 

The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value of the RSUs converted to common stock and the total grant-date fair value of RSUs vested (dollars in millions, except weighted-average grant-date fair value amounts): ##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Intrinsic value of RSUs converted to common stock $ 68 &#160; $ 59 &#160; $ 62 &#160; Grant-date fair value of RSUs vested $ 56 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ 47 &#160; Weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted $ 104.20 &#160; $ 116.50 &#160; $ 101.47 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2023, there was $ 46 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.86 years. 

RSUs provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control or upon certain terminations (as defined in the Omnibus Plan or the award certificate). RSUs include the right to receive dividend equivalents in the same amount and at the same time as dividends paid to all Company common shareholders.

(1) All PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, are unvested PSUs. 

(2) Includes 227,082 PSUs granted in 2021 that are earned based on the Company&#8217;s cumulative EPS as measured over the three-year performance period, which ended December 31, 2023, and are subject to the requisite service period, which ended February 1, 2024. 

(3) Includes 187,128 PSUs granted in 2022 that are earned based on the Company&#8217;s cumulative EPS as measured over the three-year performance period, which ends December 31, 2024, and are subject to the requisite service period, which ends February 1, 2025. 

(4) Includes 166,467 PSUs granted in 2023 that may be earned based on the Company&#8217;s cumulative EPS as measured over the three-year performance period, which ends December 31, 2025, and are subject to the requisite service period, which ends February 1, 2026. 

Compensation cost associated with PSUs is determined based on the number of instruments granted, the fair value on the date of grant and the performance factor. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Each PSU outstanding at December 31, 2023, is a restricted stock instrument that is subject to additional conditions and constitutes a contingent and unsecured promise by the Company to pay up to 1.5 shares per unit of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the conversion date for the PSU, contingent on the number of PSUs to be issued. PSUs have a performance period of three years and a vesting period of three years . The requisite service period of an award having both performance and service conditions is the longest of the explicit, implicit and derived service periods. 

The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value of the PSUs converted to common stock and the total grant-date fair value of PSUs vested (dollars in millions, except weighted-average grant-date fair value amounts): ##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Intrinsic value of PSUs converted to common stock $ 47 &#160; $ 29 &#160; $ 15 &#160; Grant-date fair value of PSUs vested $ 35 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 18 &#160; Weighted-average grant-date fair value of PSUs granted $ 110.70 &#160; $ 124.01 &#160; $ 94.21 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2023, there was $ 7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.06 years. 

PSUs provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control or upon certain terminations (as defined in the Omnibus Plan or the award certificate). PSUs include the right to receive dividend equivalents, which will accumulate and pay out in cash if and when the underlying shares are issued. 

11. Employee Benefit Plans 

The Company sponsors the Discover Financial Services Pension Plan (the &#8220;Discover Pension Plan&#8221;), which is a non-contributory defined benefit plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for eligible employees in the U.S. Effective December 31, 2008, the Discover Pension Plan was amended to discontinue the accrual of future benefits. The Company also sponsors the Discover Financial Services 401(k) Plan (the &#8220;Discover 401(k) Plan&#8221;), which is a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for its eligible U.S. employees. 

Discover Pension Plan 

The Discover Pension Plan generally provides retirement benefits that are based on each participant&#8217;s years of credited service prior to 2009 and on compensation specified in the Discover Pension Plan. The Company&#8217;s policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Net periodic benefit cost (income) is recorded in employee compensation and benefits within the consolidated statements of income. For this plan, the net periodic benefit cost was immaterial for all periods presented. 

The Company measures the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation and recognizes that amount as either an asset or liability in the consolidated statements of financial condition as appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company contributed approximately $ 115 million to the defined benefit pension plan. The over-funded status related to the defined benefit pension plan recorded in other assets was $ 14 million as of December 31, 2023. The unfunded status related to the defined benefit pension plan recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities was $ 101 million as of December 31, 2022. Expected benefit payments from the Discover Pension Plan for each of the next five years range from $ 27 million and $ 30 million annually. 

Discover 401(k) Plan 

Under the Discover 401(k) Plan, eligible U.S. employees receive 401(k) matching contributions. Eligible employees also receive fixed employer contributions. The pretax expense associated with the Company contributions for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 128 million, $ 104 million and $ 97 million, respectively. 

12. &#160; Common and Preferred Stock 

Common Stock Repurchase Program 

In April 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 4.2 billion of share repurchases. The program expired on April 18, 2023.

This program expires on June 30, 2024. As reported in the second quarter of 2023, the Company decided to pause share repurchases while an internal review of compliance, risk management and corporate governance is ongoing. See Note 19: Litigation and Regulatory Matters for additional information on the card product misclassification. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company evaluates the likelihood of realizing its deferred tax assets by estimating sources of future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies.

The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company's federal income tax filings are open to examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2020 and forward. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments or settlements in each of the taxing jurisdictions.

17. &#160; Capital Adequacy 

DFS is subject to the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve. Discover Bank, the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiary, is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as administered by the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit the Company&#8217;s business activities and have a direct material effect on the financial condition and operating results of DFS and Discover Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, DFS and Discover Bank must meet specific risk-based capital requirements and leverage ratios that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidelines. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

DFS and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory and capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and FDIC, respectively, under the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework (&#8220;Basel III rules&#8221;). Under the Basel III rules, DFS and Discover Bank are classified as &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; entities. Standardized approach entities are defined as U.S. banking organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure less than $10 billion. 

In accordance with the final rule on the impact of CECL on regulatory capital, the Company has elected to phase in the impact over three years beginning in 2022. Accordingly, the Company's Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratios are higher than they otherwise would have been. The Company's CET1 capital ratios will continue to be favorably impacted by this election over the phase-in period, which ends December 31, 2024. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, DFS and Discover Bank met all Basel III minimum capital ratio requirements to which they were subject. DFS and Discover Bank also met the requirements to be considered &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under Regulation Y and prompt corrective action rules, respectively. There have been no conditions or events that management believes have changed DFS&#8217; or Discover Bank&#8217;s category. To be categorized as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; DFS and Discover Bank must maintain minimum capital ratios outlined in the table below. 

The following table shows the actual capital amounts and ratios of DFS and Discover Bank and comparisons of each to the regulatory minimum and &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; Actual Minimum Capital Requirements Capital Requirements To Be Classified as Well-Capitalized &#160; Amount Ratio (1)

(2) The Basel III rules do not establish well-capitalized thresholds for these measures for bank holding companies. Existing well-capitalized thresholds established in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y have been included where available. 

(3) Capital amounts and ratios have been updated to reflect the impact of the restatement described in Note 26: Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements. Discover Bank capital amounts and ratios presented as of December 31, 2022 have been updated from amounts previously disclosed in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023, due to certain intercompany allocations recorded in the fourth quarter. 

The amount of dividends that a bank may pay in any year is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Under the current banking regulations, a bank may not pay dividends if such a payment would leave the bank inadequately capitalized. Discover Bank paid dividends of $ 1.7 billion, $ 4.0 billion and $ 3.3 billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to DFS. 

18. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees 

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments, transactions and obligations under guarantee arrangements that expose the Company to varying degrees of risk. The Company&#8217;s commitments, contingencies and guarantee relationships are described below. 

Commitments 

Unused Credit Arrangements 

At December 31, 2023, the Company had unused credit arrangements for loans of approximately $ 229.8 billion. Such arrangements arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions in the related agreements. These arrangements, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness, loan qualification and the cost of capital. As the Company&#8217;s credit card loans are unconditionally cancellable, no liability for expected credit losses is required for unused lines of credit. For all other loans, the Company records a liability for expected credit losses for unfunded commitments, which is presented as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Contingencies 

See Note 19: Litigation and Regulatory Matters for a description of potential liability arising from pending litigation or regulatory proceedings involving the Company. 

Guarantees 

The Company has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts, indemnification agreements and representations and warranties, which contingently require the Company to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Company to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement. The Company&#8217;s use of guarantees is disclosed below by type of guarantee. 

Securitizations Representations and Warranties 

As part of the Company&#8217;s financing activities, the Company provides representations and warranties that certain assets pledged as collateral in secured borrowing arrangements conform to specified guidelines. Due diligence is performed by the Company, which is intended to ensure that asset guideline qualifications are met. If the assets pledged as collateral do not meet certain conforming guidelines, the Company may be required to replace, repurchase or sell such assets. In its credit card securitization activities, the Company would replace nonconforming receivables through the allocation of excess seller&#8217;s interest or from additional transfers from the unrestricted pool of receivables. If the Company could not add enough receivables to satisfy the requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors&#8217; interests would be triggered. In its student loan securitizations, the Company would generally repurchase the loans from the trust at the outstanding principal amount plus interest. 

The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of third-party investor interests in credit card asset-backed securities and the principal amount of any private student loan secured borrowings, plus any unpaid interest for the corresponding secured borrowings. The Company has recorded substantially all of the maximum potential amount of future payments in long-term borrowings on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company has not recorded any incremental contingent liability associated with its secured borrowing representations and warranties. Management believes that the probability of having to replace, repurchase or sell assets pledged as collateral under secured borrowing arrangements, including an early amortization event, is low. 

Counterparty Settlement Guarantees 

Diners Club and DFS Services LLC (on behalf of PULSE) have various counterparty exposures, which are listed below: 

&#8226; Merchant Guarantee . Diners Club has entered into contractual relationships with certain international merchants, which generally include travel-related businesses, for the benefit of all Diners Club licensees. The licensees hold the primary liability to settle the transactions of their customers with these merchants. However, Diners Club retains a counterparty exposure if a licensee fails to meet its financial payment obligation to one of these merchants. 

&#8226; ATM Guarantee. PULSE entered into contractual relationships with certain international ATM acquirers in which DFS Services LLC retains counterparty exposure if an issuer fails to fulfill its settlement obligation. 

&#8226; Global Network Alliance Guarantee. Discover Network, Diners Club and PULSE have entered into contractual relationships with certain international payment networks in which DFS Services LLC retains the counterparty exposure if a network fails to fulfill its settlement obligation. 

The maximum potential amount of future payments related to such contingent obligations is dependent upon the transaction volume processed between the time a potential counterparty defaults on its settlement and the time at which the Company disables the settlement of any further transactions for the defaulting party. The Company has some contractual remedies to offset these counterparty settlement exposures (such as letters of credit or pledged deposits), however, there is no limitation on the maximum amount the Company may be liable to pay. 

The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the Company cannot determine whether particular counterparties will fail to meet their settlement obligations. In the event all licensees and/or issuers were to become unable to settle their transactions, the Company estimates its maximum potential counterparty exposures to these settlement guarantees would be approximately $ 100 million as of December 31, 2023. 

The Company believes that the estimated amounts of maximum potential future payments are not representative of the Company&#8217;s actual potential loss exposure given Diners Club&#8217;s and PULSE&#8217;s insignificant historical losses from these counterparty exposures. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no t recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated statements of financial condition for these counterparty exposures and management believes that the probability of any payments under these arrangements is low. 

Discover Network Merchant Chargeback Guarantees 

The Company operates the Discover Network, issues payment cards and permits third parties to issue payment cards. The Company is contingently liable for certain transactions processed on the Discover Network in the event of a dispute between the payment card customer and a merchant. The contingent liability arises if the disputed transaction involves a merchant or merchant acquirer with whom the Discover Network has a direct relationship. If a dispute is resolved in the customer&#8217;s favor, the Discover Network will credit or refund the disputed amount to the Discover Network card issuer, who in turn credits its customer&#8217;s account. The Discover Network will then charge back the disputed amount of the payment card transaction to the merchant or merchant acquirer, where permitted by the applicable agreement, to seek recovery of amounts already paid to the merchant for payment card transactions. If the Discover Network is unable to collect the amount subject to dispute from the merchant or merchant acquirer (e.g., in the event of merchant default or dissolution or after expiration of the time period for chargebacks in the applicable agreement), the Discover Network will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the customer. In most instances, a loss by the Discover Network is unlikely to arise in connection with payments on card transactions because most products or services are delivered when purchased and credits are issued by merchants on returned items in a timely fashion, thus minimizing the likelihood of cardholder disputes with respect to amounts paid by the Discover Network. However, where the product or service is not scheduled to be provided to the customer until a later date following the purchase, the likelihood of a contingent payment obligation by the Discover Network increases. Losses related to merchant chargebacks were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 

The maximum potential amount of obligations of the Discover Network arising from such contingent obligations is estimated to be the portion of the total Discover Network transaction volume processed to date for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant issuer and customer agreements. There is no limitation on the maximum amount the Company may be liable to pay to issuers. However, the Company believes that such amount is not representative of the Company&#8217;s actual potential loss exposure based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience. The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the Company cannot determine whether the current or cumulative transaction volumes may include or result in disputed transactions. 

The following table summarizes certain information regarding merchant chargeback guarantees (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021

(1) Represents transactions processed on the Discover Network for which a potential liability exists that, in aggregate, can differ from credit card sales volume. 

The Company did not record any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for merchant chargeback guarantees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company mitigates the risk of potential loss exposure by withholding settlement from merchants, obtaining third-party guarantees, or obtaining escrow deposits or letters of credit from certain merchant acquirers or merchants that are considered a higher risk due to various factors such as time delays in the delivery of products or services. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had escrow deposits and settlement withholdings of $ 10 million and $ 11 million, respectively, which are recorded in interest-bearing deposit accounts and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of financial condition. 

19. Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

In the normal course of business, from time to time, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. The litigation process is not predictable and can lead to unexpected results. The Company contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. 

The Company has historically offered its customers an arbitration clause in its customer agreements. The arbitration clause allows the Company and its customers to quickly and economically resolve disputes. Additionally, the arbitration clause has in some instances limited the costs of, and the Company&#8217;s exposure to, litigation. Future legal and regulatory challenges and prohibitions may cause the Company to discontinue its offering and use of such clauses. From time to time, the Company is involved in legal actions challenging its arbitration clause. Bills may be periodically introduced in Congress to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses. 

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding the Company&#8217;s business including, among other matters, regulatory, accounting, tax and other operational matters. The investigations and proceedings may result in significant adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, decreases in regulatory ratings, customer restitution or other relief. These outcomes could materially impact the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, increase its cost of operations, or limit the Company&#8217;s ability to execute its business strategies and engage in certain business activities. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) and FDIC, as described below. Pursuant to powers granted under federal banking laws, regulatory agencies have broad and sweeping discretion and may assess civil money penalties, require changes to certain business practices or require customer restitution at any time. 

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes a liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters create loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. Litigation and regulatory settlement-related expense was $ 17 million, $ 15 million and $ 59 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

There may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (meaning the likelihood of losses is more than remote but less than likely), in excess of the amounts that the Company has accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings, is up to $ 230 million as of December 31, 2023. This estimated range of reasonably possible losses is based on currently available information for those proceedings in which the Company is involved and considers the Company&#8217;s best estimate of such losses for those matters for which an estimate can be made. It does not represent the Company&#8217;s maximum potential loss exposure. Various aspects of the legal proceedings underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated range noted above involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues, the breadth of the claims (often spanning multiple years and, in some cases, a wide range of business activities), unspecified damages and/or the novelty of the legal issues presented. The outcome of pending matters could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation and be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, the level of the Company&#8217;s income for such period. 

In July 2015, the Company announced that its subsidiaries, Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation and Discover Products Inc. (the &#8220;Discover Subsidiaries&#8221;), agreed to a consent order with the CFPB with respect to certain private student loan servicing practices (the &#8220;2015 Order&#8221;). The 2015 Order expired in July 2020. In December 2020, the Discover Subsidiaries agreed to a consent order (the &#8220;2020 Order&#8221;) with the CFPB resolving the agency&#8217;s investigation into Discover Bank&#8217;s compliance with the 2015 Order. In connection with the 2020 Order, Discover is required to implement a redress and compliance plan and must pay at least $ 10 million in consumer redress to consumers who may have been harmed and has paid a $ 25 million civil money penalty to the CFPB. 

On September 25, 2023, following the consent of the Board of Directors of Discover Bank, the FDIC issued a consent order (the &#8220;2023 Order&#8221;) to Discover Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. The 2023 Order addresses shortcomings in Discover Bank&#8217;s compliance management system for consumer protection laws and related matters. It does not contain any monetary penalties or fines. As part of the 2023 Order, Discover Bank agreed to improve its consumer compliance management system and enhance related corporate governance and enterprise risk management practices, and increase the level of Board oversight over such matters. Discover Bank has been taking significant steps to strengthen the organization&#8217;s compliance management system and address the other issues identified in the 2023 Order. In addition, Discover added two new independent directors with significant banking experience to the Boards of Discover and Discover Bank in the third quarter of 2023. 

Management and the Board are committed to meeting all the requirements of the 2023 Order. Discover Bank is working diligently to complete items required by the 2023 Order. This includes having retained third party consultants to conduct independent reviews and the submission of action plans to the FDIC by the required deadlines for review and feedback. The actions completed to date, taken together with actions previously undertaken to improve and enhance its compliance management system and enhance related corporate governance, address multiple consent order objectives, however, many provisions require longer term implementation. Depending on regulatory feedback, the timing of approvals and sustainability periods, necessary work is not likely to be completed until at least 2025. 

On March 8, 2016, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Company, other credit card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (B&#38;R Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milam&#8217;s Market, et al. v. Visa, Inc., et al.) alleging a conspiracy by defendants to shift fraud liability to merchants with the migration to the EMV security standard and chip technology. The plaintiffs assert joint and several liability among the defendants and seek unspecified damages, including treble damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs and injunctive relief. The Company filed its motion to compel arbitration, motion for summary judgment, and Daubert challenges on November 30, 2022, and awaits rulings. The Company is not in a position at this time to assess the likely outcome or its exposure, if any, with respect to this matter. However, the Company will seek to defend itself vigorously against all claims asserted by the plaintiffs. 

Card Product Misclassification 

As reported in the second quarter of 2023, beginning in 2007, the Company incorrectly classified certain credit card accounts into its highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. The misclassification affected pricing for certain merchants and merchant acquirers, but not for cardholders. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a liability of $ 365 million within accrued expenses and other liabilities to provide refunds to merchants and merchant acquirers as a result of the card product misclassification. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the 

liability was $ 375 million, reflecting an additional $ 11 million for the estimated effect of the current price tiering on discount and interchange assessments recorded in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, $ 12 million of disbursements had been made against this liability as the Company continues to develop its plan to provide refunds to merchants and merchant acquirers and engage in ongoing discussions about such plans with its regulators. Regulators may impose other requirements that may result in additional charges or a remediation amount that differs, possibly materially, from the Company&#8217;s current estimate. 

Management has corrected the card product misclassification as of November 2023, and the Company remains in discussions with its regulators regarding this matter. The Company expects these discussions will likely result in enforcement actions, which may include, among other remedies, monetary penalties, the amount of which cannot be estimated at this time. 

In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various lawsuits, including putative class actions on behalf of affected merchants, a putative class action on behalf of shareholders and shareholder derivative actions. The Company also is cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) investigation into the card product misclassification matter. The Company believes that additional losses are probable as a result of these actions but is not able to make a reasonable estimate of such losses as of December 31, 2023. 

20. Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , provides a three-level hierarchy for classifying the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of financial instruments based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. It also requires certain disclosures about those measurements. The three-level valuation hierarchy is as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1 : Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs are defined as those that utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 

&#8226; Level 2 : Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs are those that utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets, quoted prices for the identical assets in an inactive market and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. The Company evaluates factors such as the frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and the significance of adjustments made when considering transactions involving similar assets or liabilities to assess the relevance of those observed prices. If relevant and observable prices are available, the fair values of the related assets or liabilities would be classified as Level 2. 

&#8226; Level 3 : Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are those based on unobservable inputs and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability being valued. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Accordingly, the Company may utilize both observable and unobservable inputs in determining the fair values of financial instruments classified within the Level 3 category. 

The Company evaluates the classification of each fair value measurement within the hierarchy at least quarterly. 

The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and involves consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability. Furthermore, certain techniques used to measure fair value involve some degree of judgment and, as a result, are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Quoted Price in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Balance at December 31, 2023 Assets Fair value - OCI U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSE securities $ 12,928 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12,937 &#160; Residential mortgage-backed securities - Agency &#8212; &#160; 465 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 465 &#160; Available-for-sale investment securities $ 12,928 &#160; $ 474 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 13,402 &#160;

Available-for-Sale Investment Securities 

Investment securities classified as available-for-sale consist of U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSE securities and RMBS. The fair value estimates of investment securities classified as Level 1, consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, are determined based on quoted market prices for the same securities. The fair value estimates of U.S. GSE securities and RMBS are classified as Level 2 and are valued by maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar securities, benchmark yield curves and market-corroborated inputs. 

The Company validates the fair value estimates provided by pricing services primarily by comparing to valuations obtained through other pricing sources. The Company evaluates pricing variances among different pricing sources to ensure that the valuations utilized are reasonable. The Company also corroborates the reasonableness of the fair value estimates with analysis of trends of significant inputs, such as market interest rate curves. The Company further performs due diligence in understanding the procedures and techniques performed by the pricing services to derive fair value estimates. 

At December 31, 2023, amounts reported in RMBS reflect U.S. government agency and U.S. GSE obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with an aggregate par value of $ 480 million, a weighted-average coupon of 4.09 % and a weighted-average remaining maturity of four years . 

Marketable Equity Securities 

The Company holds non-controlling equity positions in payment service entities that have actively traded stock and therefore have readily determinable fair values. The Company classifies these equity securities as Level 1, the fair value estimates of which are determined based on quoted share prices for the same securities. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. These instruments are classified as Level 2 as their fair values are estimated using proprietary pricing models, containing certain assumptions based on readily observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, option volatility and foreign currency forward and spot rates. In determining fair values, the pricing models use widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and the observable market-based inputs. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from the observable market interest rate curves. The Company considers collateral and master netting agreements that mitigate credit exposure to counterparties in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. The fair values of the currency instruments are valued by comparing the contracted forward exchange rate pertaining to the specific contract maturities to the current market exchange rate. 

The Company validates the fair value estimates of interest rate swaps primarily through comparison to the fair value estimates computed by the counterparties to each of the derivative transactions. The Company evaluates pricing variances among different pricing sources to ensure that the valuations utilized are reasonable. The Company also corroborates the reasonableness of the fair value estimates with analysis of trends of significant inputs, such as market interest rate curves. The Company performs due diligence in understanding the impact of any changes to the valuation techniques performed by proprietary pricing models before implementation, working closely with the third-party valuation service and reviewing the service&#8217;s control objectives at least annually. The Company corroborates the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts through independent calculation of the fair value estimates. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

The Company also has assets that, under certain conditions, are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets include those associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to the initial recognition of the assets may be applicable whenever one is tested for impairment. No impairments were recognized related to these assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Financial Instruments Measured at Other Than Fair Value

21. Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

The Company uses derivatives to manage its exposure to various financial risks. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Certain derivatives used to manage the Company&#8217;s exposure to foreign currency are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. 

Derivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which generally is mitigated through collateral arrangements as described under the sub-heading &#8220;&#8212; Collateral Requirements and Credit-Risk Related Contingency Features.&#8221; The Company enters into derivative transactions with established dealers that meet minimum credit criteria established by the Company. All counterparties must be pre-approved before engaging in any transaction with the Company. The Company regularly monitors counterparties to ensure compliance with the Company&#8217;s risk policies and limits. In determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment for the fair values of derivatives, if any, the Company considers collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate credit exposure to related counterparties. 

All derivatives are recorded in other assets at their gross positive fair values and in accrued expenses and other liabilities at their gross negative fair values. See Note 20: Fair Value Measurements for a description of the valuation methodologies used for derivatives. Cash collateral amounts associated with derivative positions that are cleared through an exchange are legally characterized as settlement of the derivative positions. Such collateral amounts are reflected as offsets to the associated derivatives balances recorded in other assets or in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Other cash collateral posted and held balances are recorded in other assets and deposits, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Collateral amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition are based on the net collateral posted or held position for each applicable legal entity&#8217;s master netting arrangement with each counterparty. 

Derivatives Designated as Hedges 

Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows arising from changes in interest rates, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to variability in cash flows related to changes in interest rates on interest-earning assets and funding instruments. These interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (&#8220;ASC 815&#8221;). At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company&#8217;s outstanding cash flow hedges primarily relate to interest receipts from credit card receivables and had an initial maximum period of five years and three years , respectively. 

The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted cash flows affect earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives at December 31, 2023, will be reclassified to interest income and interest expense as interest receipts and payments are accrued on the Company&#8217;s then outstanding credit card receivables and certain floating-rate debt, respectively. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates it will reclassify $ 79 million into pretax earnings related to its cash flow hedges. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations due to changes in interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate long-term borrowings, including securitized debt and bank notes, attributable to changes in the respective benchmark rates. These interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with ASC 815. Changes in the fair values of both (i) the derivatives and (ii) the hedged long-term borrowings attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged are recorded in interest expense and generally provide substantial offset to one another. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts 

The Company has foreign exchange forward contracts that are economic hedges and are not designated as accounting hedges. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income on the consolidated statements of income. 

Derivatives Cleared Through an Exchange 

Cash variation margin payments on derivatives cleared through an exchange are legally considered settlement payments and are accounted for with corresponding derivative positions as one unit of account and not presented separately as collateral. With settlement payments on derivative positions cleared through this exchange reflected as offsets to the associated derivative asset and liability balances, the fair values of derivative instruments and collateral balances shown are generally reduced.

Collateral Requirements and Credit-Risk Related Contingency Features 

The Company has master netting arrangements and minimum collateral posting thresholds with its counterparties for its fair value and cash flow hedge interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company has not sought a legal opinion in relation to the enforceability of its master netting arrangements and, as such, does not report any of these positions on a net basis. Collateral is required by either the Company or its subsidiaries or the counterparty depending on the net fair value position of the derivatives held with that counterparty. These collateral receivable or payable amounts are generally not offset against the fair value of these derivatives but are recorded separately in other assets or deposits. Most of the Company&#8217;s cash collateral amounts relate to positions cleared through an exchange and are reflected as offsets to the associated derivatives balances recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities. 

The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision under which the Company could be declared in default on any of its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where the lender has not accelerated repayment of the indebtedness. 

22. Segment Disclosures 

The Company manages its business activities in two segments: Digital Banking and Payment Services. 

&#8226; Digital Banking: The Digital Banking segment includes Discover-branded credit cards issued to individuals on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including private student loans, personal loans, home loans and deposit products. The majority of Digital Banking revenues relate to interest income earned on the segment&#8217;s loan products. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s credit card products generate substantially all revenues related to discount and interchange, protection products and loan fee income. 

&#8226; Payment Services: The Payment Services segment includes PULSE, an ATM, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and the Company&#8217;s Network Partners business, which provides payment transaction processing and settlement services on the Discover Network. The majority of Payment Services revenues relate to transaction processing revenue from PULSE and royalty and licensee revenue from Diners Club. 

The business segment reporting provided to and used by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision-maker is prepared using the following principles and allocation conventions: 

&#8226; The Company aggregates operating segments when determining reportable segments. 

&#8226; Corporate overhead is not allocated between segments; all corporate overhead is included in the Digital Banking segment. 

&#8226; Through its operation of the Discover Network, the Digital Banking segment incurs fixed marketing, servicing and infrastructure costs that are not specifically allocated among the segments, except for an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Company&#8217;s Payment Services segment. 

&#8226; The Company&#8217;s assets are not allocated among the operating segments in the information reviewed by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision-maker. 

&#8226; The revenues of each segment are derived from external sources. The segments do not earn revenue from intercompany sources. 

&#8226; Income taxes are not specifically allocated between the operating segments in the information reviewed by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker.

23. &#160; Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;), generally applies to the sales of any good or service for which no other specific accounting guidance is provided. ASC 606 defines a principles-based model under which revenue from a contract is allocated to the distinct performance obligations within the contract and recognized in income as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company&#8217;s revenue that is subject to this model includes discount and interchange, protection products fees, transaction processing revenue and certain amounts classified as other income. 

The following table presents revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by business segment and reconciles revenue from contracts with customers to total other income (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START Digital Banking Payment Services Total For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Other income subject to ASC 606

(1) Subsequent to the issuance of the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company identified an immaterial classification error within cash flows (used for)/provided by investing activities. The correction of this error had no impact on the net cash (used for)/provided by investing activities. Management has evaluated the materiality of this misstatement and concluded it was not material to the prior period. 

26. Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements 

As reported in the second quarter of 2023, beginning in 2007, the Company incorrectly classified certain credit card accounts into its highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. The card product classification impacts the pricing and charging of discount and interchange revenue, which is recorded within discount and interchange revenue, net, on the consolidated statements of income. The Company determined the revenue impact of the incorrect card product classification was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all impacted prior periods. For comparative purposes, the Company has made these immaterial corrections to the recognition of discount and interchange revenue, as well as the related impacts to assets, liabilities and retained earnings in the prior periods presented in this Form 10-K. Assets were impacted by adjustments to deferred tax assets, and liabilities were impacted by an adjustment to the liability for estimated refunds to merchants and merchant acquirers.
