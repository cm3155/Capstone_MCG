 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements, which speak to our expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "aim," "will," "may," "should," "could," "would," "likely," "forecast," and similar expressions. Such statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report and there is no undertaking to update or revise them as more information becomes available.

We routinely evaluate and may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or divestitures from businesses, products, technologies, loan portfolios or deposits, which may involve payment in cash or our debt or equity securities. 

Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described below can be found in this section of this quarterly report and in "Risk Factors," "Business," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the SEC's internet site (https://www.sec.gov). 

Introduction and Overview 

Discover Financial Services ("DFS") is a digital banking and payment services company. We provide digital banking products and services and payment services through our subsidiaries. We offer our customers credit card loans, personal loans, home loans and deposit products. We also operate the Discover Network, the PULSE network ("PULSE") and Diners Club International ("Diners Club"), collectively known as the Discover Global Network. The Discover Network processes transactions for Discover-branded credit and debit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to automated teller machines domestically and internationally and merchant acceptance throughout the United States of America ("U.S.") for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded credit and charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. 

Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, financial institutions, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), credit loss provisions, customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt. 

Quarter Highlights 

The highlights below compare results as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, against results for the same period in the prior year. 

&#8226; Net income was $870 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, compared to net income of $586 million, or $2.21 per diluted share, in the prior year. 

&#8226; Total loans grew $4.3 billion, or 4%, to $127.0 billion. 

&#8226; Credit card loans grew $3.1 billion, or 3%, to $100.5 billion. 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate for credit card loans increased 125 basis points to 5.28% and the delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due increased 43 basis points to 3.84%. 

&#8226; Direct-to-consumer deposits grew $9.1 billion, or 11%, to $90.3 billion. 

&#8226; Payment Services transaction volume for the segment was $100.5 billion, up 9%. 

Outlook 

The outlook below provides our current expectations for our financial results based on market conditions, the regulatory and legal environment and our business strategies. The outlook below incorporates the impacts of the sale of our private student loan portfolio. 

&#8226; We expect a decrease in total loans as a result of the private student loan portfolio sale. 

&#8226; Net interest margin is expected to increase, in comparison to 2023, driven primarily by higher card yields and the impact from the exit of private student lending. 

&#8226; We expect the total net charge-off rate to increase, in comparison to the prior year, driven primarily by the seasoning of recent vintages with higher delinquencies. 

&#8226; Excluding card misclassification and merger related costs, total expenses are expected to increase, driven by continued investments in compliance and risk management capabilities and wage growth. We remain committed to managing expenses while continuing to make investments in profitable long-term growth. 

Regulatory Environment and Developments 

Banking 

Capital Standards and Stress Testing 

As a bank holding company, DFS is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve based on forward-looking internal analysis of income and capital levels under baseline and stressful conditions. DFS is also subject to capital buffer requirements, including the Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"), which requires maintaining regulatory capital levels above a threshold based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments. 

In January 2021, the Federal Reserve finalized regulatory amendments that made targeted changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting and SCB requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards, including DFS, to be consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulatory tailoring framework. The final rules generally align to instructions the Federal Reserve previously provided to Category IV firms regarding their respective capital plan submissions. The amended rules also provide Category IV firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish for the Federal Reserve to reset the stress test portion of their SCB requirement. The Federal Reserve also revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align with the tailoring framework. However, the timing and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance are uncertain. Moreover, following the failure of three domestic banks during March and April 2023, members of Congress, the President of the United States and various bank regulatory authorities have made public statements indicating a desire for additional prudential regulation for Category IV firms like DFS. 

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework (the "Basel III rules"), which includes replacing the current "advanced approach" with a new expanded risk-based approach. In addition, the proposal introduces new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, and would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banking institutions with assets of $100 billion or more, including DFS. If adopted, the new requirements would be effective July 1, 2025 with a three-year transition period. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision previewed potential changes to the July 2023 proposal, including no longer subjecting Category IV institutions to the proposed revisions other than the requirement to recognize accumulated other comprehensive income, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC have not yet issued any changes to the July 2023 proposal. 

In August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC (the "Agencies") issued a proposal that would require banking institutions in Categories II through IV of the tailoring framework, including DFS, and their insured depository institution subsidiaries with $100 billion or more in assets such as Discover Bank, to have minimum levels of outstanding long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, a covered banking institution would be required to have a minimum outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt that is at least 6% of the institution&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets, 2.5% of its total leverage exposure (if it is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio) and 3.5% of its average total consolidated assets, whichever is greater. If adopted, banking institutions would have three years to comply with the new requirements, though the Agencies would retain the authority to accelerate or extend the transition period. 

While we cannot currently predict the timing or substance of the finalization of these proposals or other regulatory changes, if any such change were adopted, it would likely revise the regulatory tailoring currently applicable to DFS, otherwise tighten the prudential regulatory requirements that would apply to DFS and increase our expenses. 

In accordance with the capital plan rule amendments, we elected not to participate in the 2023 supervisory stress tests, but did submit to the Federal Reserve a capital plan based on a forward-looking internal assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions. In July 2023, the Federal Reserve disclosed that our SCB was unchanged at 2.5%, effective beginning October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. On April 5, 2024, we submitted our 2024 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. On June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the 2024 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") exercise, followed by the release of the final large bank capital requirements on August 28, 2024. Our new SCB requirement increased to 3.1% and is effective from October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025, subject to potential recalculation, as discussed in the next paragraph. 

Under the Basel III rules, a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan under certain circumstances, including a material change in the firm's risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. We determined our entry into an agreement and plan of merger ("Merger Agreement") with Capital One required us to resubmit our capital plan and we submitted an updated capital plan on May 3, 2024. The resubmission process is ongoing. Under the capital plan rule and as a consequence of the resubmission requirement, we must receive prior approval for any dividend or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, and the Federal Reserve may recalculate our SCB. 

Consumer Financial Services 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services, including Discover. The CFPB's authority includes rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws; preventing "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" ("UDAAP") and ensuring that consumers have access to fair and transparent financial products and services. Historically, the CFPB's policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer (e.g., credit cards and other consumer lending products). In addition, the CFPB is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market. 

The CFPB&#8217;s priorities have continued to focus on, among other things, increased enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, with a particular focus on fees charged to consumers, UDAAP, fair lending, student lending and servicing, debt collection and credit reporting. Additionally, detection of repeat offenders, such as companies that violate a formal court or agency order, has also become a priority for the CFPB. Director Chopra, in March 2022, identified, as repeat offenders, several companies that have had multiple enforcement actions, including Discover. The CFPB has recently taken action against financial institutions for violating prior enforcement actions. In December 2020, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the CFPB regarding identified private student loan servicing practices. See Note 13: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 

On March 5, 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule that reduces Regulation Z&#8217;s safe harbor amount for credit card late fees to $8 and eliminates automatic annual inflation adjustments to that safe harbor amount. The rule is currently under legal challenge, and we continue to monitor legal developments that could impact the implementation of the final rule, which, if implemented, could result in increased cardholder delinquencies and credit losses. 

Enhanced regulatory requirements, potential supervisory findings, or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact our ability to implement certain consumer-focused enhancements to product features and functionality and business strategies, limit or change our business practices, limit our consumer product offerings, cause us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts or limit our ability to obtain related required regulatory approvals. The additional expense, time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact the cost of and access to credit for consumers and results of business operations. 

Data Security and Privacy 

Policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on enhancing data security and data breach incident response requirements. These policymakers have proposed and enacted regulations and legislation to augment consumer data privacy standards and require companies to assess and/or disclose cybersecurity metrics, risks, opportunities, policies and practices. At the federal level, Discover is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") and its implementing regulations and guidance, which regulate Discover's use and disclosure of our consumers' nonpublic personal information ("NPI"). In July 2023, the SEC adopted rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure. For more information on Discover's cybersecurity program in connection with these rules, see "Item 1C. Cybersecurity" in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. In April 2024, the Department of Homeland Security proposed regulations to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 and create new cyber incident and ransom payment reporting requirements for covered entities, including entities that own or operate financial services sector infrastructure. Final regulations are expected to be published in late 2025 and become effective in 2026. 

At the state level, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which became effective in 2020, created a broad set of privacy rights and remedies. The California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective in 2023, amended the CCPA, enhanced consumer privacy protections and created a new California Privacy Protection Agency ("CPPA"). The CPPA has proposed additional regulations around cybersecurity, risk assessments and automated decision-making technology that may 

impact Discover as the proposed regulations move forward in the formal rulemaking process. Other states continue to pass privacy legislation. To date, these laws have contained either data-level exemptions for NPI or entity-level exemptions for financial institutions subject to the GLBA or state banking laws, so the impact of these state privacy laws on several Discover businesses is limited. We continue to evaluate the impact of the CCPA, as well as other federal and state privacy laws, on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services, including laws regulating the capture and use of consumer biometrics. For more information on the impact to Discover of data security and privacy laws on regulation, see "Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Environmental, Social and Governance Matters 

Environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues, including climate change, human capital and governance practices, are a significant area of focus by U.S. federal, state and international lawmakers and regulatory agencies, as well as shareholders and other stakeholders. In recent months, there have been substantial legislative and regulatory developments on such issues, including proposed, issued or implemented legislation and rulemakings concerning how companies assess and/or disclose climate and other ESG information, risks, opportunities, policies and practices. For example, in October 2023, three climate-related disclosure bills were signed in California, and in March 2024, the SEC issued a final rule on climate-related disclosures. The potential impacts of these legislative and regulatory requirements are being evaluated at this time (including as a result of ongoing litigation challenging such requirements and the SEC&#8217;s order staying its final rule on climate-related disclosures pending the completion of judicial review). We expect that these and other emerging and evolving legal and regulatory requirements on ESG issues will result in additional compliance and reporting costs to us, and we continue to evaluate and assess the potential impact of these legal and regulatory developments.

Digital Banking 

Our Digital Banking segment reported pretax income of $1.1 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $676 million and $3.0 billion, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 

Net interest income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a higher average level of loan receivables and a higher yield on loans, partially offset by higher funding costs. Interest income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a higher average level of loan receivables and yield expansion. Interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a larger funding base and higher funding costs driven by lower coupon maturities and higher market rates. Also contributing to the increases in interest income and interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was higher market rates. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses decreased as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by portfolio seasoning. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses decreased as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by the reversal of the private student loans allowance due to the loans being classified as held-for-sale, partially offset by the impact of loan growth. For a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses, see "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses." 

Total other income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in other income, which was driven by a gain recognized from the first closing of the sale of our private student loan portfolio. 

Total other income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in other income, net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income. Other income increased primarily from a gain recognized from the first closing of the sale of our private student loan portfolio. The increase in net discount and interchange revenue was driven primarily by lower rewards expense. Loan fee income increased primarily due to a higher volume of late payments. 

Total other expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, information processing and communications and professional fees. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily from higher average salaries and 

employee retention awards. Information processing and communications increased primarily from technology investments and accelerated private student loan software depreciation. The increase in professional fees was driven primarily from increases in recovery fees and consulting supporting the pending merger. 

Total other expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, other expense and professional fees. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily by higher average salaries and employee retention awards. Other expense increased primarily from charges for potential regulatory penalties related to the card product misclassification matter. For information regarding the card product misclassification, see Note 13: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Professional fees increased primarily from increased consulting supporting compliance and risk management initiatives and the pending merger . 

Discover card sales volume was $53.4 billion and $157.0 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was a decrease of 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. This volume decrease was primarily driven by lower new account growth. 

Payment Services 

Pretax income for the Payment Services segment was relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Pretax income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily from a favorable legal settlement. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses was $8.5 billion at September 30, 2024, which reflects a $31 million build from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of our financial assets measured at amortized cost. Changes in the allowance for credit losses, and in the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect net income. 

In estimating the expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistical models and qualitative analysis. There is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to estimate the allowance for credit losses. For more information on these judgments and our accounting policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Loan Quality," Note 4: Loan Receivables and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

One of the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in estimating the current expected credit losses ("CECL") on a quarterly basis is the determination of the macroeconomic forecasts used in the loss forecast models. For the reasonable and supportable loss forecast period, we consider forecasts of multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with one or more optimistic (upside) or pessimistic (downside) scenarios. These scenarios comprise a variety of macroeconomic variables, including annualized gross domestic product growth and unemployment rate. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends. Assumptions about the macroeconomic environment are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual changes in the allowance for credit losses may be different from the simulated scenario presented below. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity of the estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we measured the impact of altering the weighting of macroeconomic scenarios used in our loss forecast. Our allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $444 million at September 30, 2024 if we applied 100% weight to the most adverse scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect continued elevated interest rates, a decline in consumer confidence, the influence of geopolitical events and increasing unemployment. 

The sensitivity disclosed above is hypothetical. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input, such as the weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because we consider a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. The macroeconomic scenarios used are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. The inputs in the macroeconomic scenarios may not change at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. As a result, the sensitivity analysis above does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. It is intended to provide insights into the impact of different judgments about the economy on our modeled loss estimates for the loan portfolio and does not imply any expectation of future losses. Furthermore, the hypothetical increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current allowance for credit losses, which may have a positive or negative effect on our actual financial condition and results of operations. 

The overall economic environment directly impacts the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models. If management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses, the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we experience significant instability in the economic environment, the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase, both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them.

Net Interest Income 

The tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest-earning assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio, on net interest income. 

Our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, (ii) restricted cash, (iii) other short-term investments, (iv) investment securities and (v) loan receivables. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct-to-consumer and brokered, and long-term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. The following factors influence net interest income: 

&#8226; The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates; 

&#8226; The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income; 

&#8226; The terms of long-term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; 

&#8226; The interest rates necessary to attract and maintain direct-to-consumer deposits; 

&#8226; The level and composition of other interest-earning assets, including our liquidity portfolio, and interest-bearing liabilities; 

&#8226; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the federal funds rate, the interest rate on reserve balances, and Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"); and 

&#8226; The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. 

Net interest income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a higher average level of loan receivables and a higher yield on loans, partially offset by higher funding costs. Interest income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a higher average level of loan receivables and yield expansion. Interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a larger funding base and higher funding costs driven by lower coupon maturities and higher market rates. Also contributing to the increases in interest income and interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was higher market rates.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date. In deriving the estimate of expected credit losses, we consider the collectability of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan portfolio. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged-off or are expected to be charged-off. Establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment. The factors that influence the provision for credit losses include: 

&#8226; Increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances, including: 

&#8226; Changes in consumer spending, payment and credit utilization behaviors; 

&#8226; The level of new account and loan originations and loan maturities; and 

&#8226; Changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio; 

&#8226; The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts, among other factors; 

&#8226; The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including national and regional conditions, unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; 

&#8226; The level and direction of historical losses; and 

&#8226; Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. 

Refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses.

(1) Excludes a $31 million adjustment of the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and $40 million and $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. With the transfer of private student loans to the held-for-sale classification as of June 30, 2024, a liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments is no longer recorded. 

(2) Includes the adjustment to eliminate the allowance for credit losses upon classifying the private student loan portfolio as held-for-sale. 

(3) Represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. 

The allowance for credit losses was approximately $8.5 billion at September 30, 2024, which reflects a $31 million build from June 30, 2024 and a $771 million release from December 31, 2023. The build in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the impact of loan growth in our loan portfolio. The release in the allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by the reversal of the private student loans allowance due to the loans being classified as held-for-sale, partially offset by the impact of loan growth. 

The allowance estimation process begins with a loss forecast that uses certain macroeconomic variables and multiple macroeconomic scenarios among its inputs. In estimating the allowance at September 30, 2024, we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected the following amounts: (i) unemployment rate ending 2024 at 4.35% and, within our reasonable and supportable period, peaking at 4.62% in the third quarter of 2025 and (ii) 2.54% growth rate in real gross domestic product in 2024. 

In estimating expected credit losses, we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior and payment trends, as well as recent and expected macroeconomic conditions, including those relating to consumer price inflation and the fiscal and monetary policy responses to that inflation. Federal Reserve officials believe trends in inflation and employment are supportive of a less restrictive monetary policy, as indicated by a reduction of the federal funds target range in September 2024 and signaling of further cuts over the remainder of 2024. However, the timing and magnitude of rate decreases will be dependent on trends in economic data, particularly inflation and labor market conditions, and monetary policy remains restrictive, which typically precedes weaker consumer credit conditions caused by rising unemployment as economic growth slows. While credit performance in our lending portfolios has evolved in line with our expectations, we assessed the prospects for various macroeconomic outcomes in setting our allowance for credit losses. 

The forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months for all periods presented. The 18 months reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate given the current economic conditions. For all periods presented, we determined that a reversion period of 12 months was appropriate for the same reason. We applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented. 

The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge-offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses decreased by $198 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by portfolio seasoning. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses decreased by $354 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by the reversal of the private student loans allowance due to the loans being classified as held-for-sale, partially offset by the impact of loan growth. 

Net Charge-offs 

Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. 

The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of key loan products (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, &#160; 2024 2023 2024 2023 &#160; $ % $ % $ % $ % Credit card loans $ 1,332 5.28 % $ 973 4.03 % $ 4,116 5.50 % $ 2,499 3.62 % Personal loans $ 106 4.01 % $ 62 2.63 % $ 307 4.00 % $ 151 2.30 % 

The net charge-offs and net charge-off rate for credit card loans and personal loans increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by portfolio seasoning. 

Delinquencies 

Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. A loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. 

The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products, excluding loans held-for-sale, that are 30 and 90 days or more delinquent, and loan receivables that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency (dollars in millions): &#160; September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 &#160; $ % $ % Loans 30 or more days delinquent Credit card loans $ 3,857 3.84 % $ 3,955 3.87 % Personal loans $ 174 1.66 % $ 143 1.45 % Total loan portfolio $ 4,105 3.46 % $ 4,156 3.45 % Loans 90 or more days delinquent Credit card loans $ 1,883 1.87 % $ 1,917 1.87 % Personal loans $ 47 0.45 % $ 39 0.40 % Total loan portfolio $ 1,960 1.65 % $ 1,975 1.59 % Loans not accruing interest $ 282 0.23 % $ 261 0.21 % 

The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates remained relatively stable for credit card loans at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates for personal loans at September 30, 2024, increased compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by portfolio seasoning.

Total other income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in other income, which was driven by a gain recognized from the first closing of the sale of our private student loan portfolio. 

Total other income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in other income, net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income. Other income increased primarily from a favorable legal settlement in our Payment Services segment and a gain recognized from the first closing of the sale of our private student loan portfolio. The increase in net discount and interchange revenue was driven primarily by lower rewards expense. Loan fee income increased primarily due to a higher volume of late payments. 

Other Expense 

The following table represents the components of other expense (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Increase (Decrease) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Increase (Decrease) &#160; 2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ % (As Restated)

Total other expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, information processing and communications and professional fees. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily from higher average salaries and employee retention awards. Information processing and communications increased primarily from technology investments and accelerated private student loan software depreciation. The increase in professional fees was driven primarily from increases in recovery fees and consulting supporting the pending merger. 

Total other expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, other expense and professional fees. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily by higher average salaries and employee retention awards. Other expense increased primarily from charges for potential regulatory penalties related to the card product misclassification matter. For information regarding the card product misclassification, see Note 13: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our 

condensed consolidated financial statements. Professional fees increased primarily from increased consulting supporting compliance and risk management initiatives and the pending merger . 

Income Tax Expense 

The following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, &#160; 2024 2023 2024 2023 (As Restated)

The effective tax rate increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, due to the adoption of the proportional amortization method for qualifying tax credit investments effective January 1, 2024, and the recognition of a charge representing potential non-deductible regulatory penalties related to the card product misclassification. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Funding and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain stable, diversified and cost-effective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress. In managing our liquidity risk, we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingency liquidity sources. Our primary funding sources include direct-to-consumer and brokered deposits, public term asset-backed securitizations and other short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary liquidity sources include a portfolio composed of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term asset-backed securitizations and Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides another source of contingency liquidity. 

Funding Sources 

Deposits 

We obtain deposits from consumers directly or through affinity relationships ("direct-to-consumer deposits"). Additionally, we obtain deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers ("brokered deposits"). Direct-to-consumer deposit products include savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IRA savings accounts, IRA certificates of deposit and checking accounts. We gather these deposits from retail customers of our bank, many of whom have more than one Discover product. These deposits originate from a large and diverse customer base, and therefore, the majority of these deposit account balances are insured according to the FDIC's insurance limits. Brokered deposit products include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. In accordance with FDIC guidance, we do not categorize certain retail deposit products such as affinity deposits and deposits generated through certain sweep deposit relationships as brokered for regulatory reporting purposes. At September 30, 2024, we had $90.3 billion of direct-to-consumer deposits and $19.5 billion of brokered deposits, of which there are $95.7 billion of deposit balances due in less than one year and $14.1 billion of deposit balances due in one year or thereafter. 

Credit Card Securitization Financing 

We securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I ("DCMT") and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust ("DCENT"). In connection with our securitization transactions, credit card receivables are transferred to DCMT. DCMT has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to DCENT. We issue DCENT DiscoverSeries notes in public and private transactions, which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by DCENT. From time to time, we may add credit card receivables to DCMT to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing seller's 

interest. As of September 30, 2024, there were $28.6 billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holding the seller's interest and subordinated classes of DCENT DiscoverSeries notes. At September 30, 2024, we had $9.3 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities and $2.5 billion of outstanding subordinated asset-backed securities that had been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as "economic early amortization," which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of DCENT during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three-month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the DiscoverSeries three-month rolling average excess spread was 14.00%. The period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received. 

Through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Discover Funding LLC, we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in DCMT in excess of the face value of outstanding investors' interests. This minimum interest is referred to as the minimum seller's interest. The required minimum seller's interest in the pool of trust receivables is approximately 7% in excess of the total investors' interests, which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us. If the level of receivables in DCMT were to fall below the required minimum, we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables, which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors. A decline in the amount of the excess seller's interest could occur if balance repayments and charge-offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors' interests. Seller's interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter. If we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum seller's interest requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors' interests would be triggered. 

An early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available non-securitization-related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. We have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event. For instance, we could add receivables to DCMT, which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. Alternatively, we could employ structured discounting, which was used effectively in 2009 to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk. 

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in credit card securitizations, excluding those that have been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries (dollars in millions): At September 30, 2024 Total Less Than One Year One Year and Thereafter Scheduled maturities of borrowings - owed to credit card securitization investors $ 9,253 $ 5,393 $ 3,860 

The "AAA(sf)" and "Aaa(sf)" ratings of the DCENT DiscoverSeries Class A Notes issued to date have been based, in part, on an FDIC rule, which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Although the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing , no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserved the safe-harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including DCMT, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 2009. However, other legislative and regulatory developments may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

Discover Bank is a member bank of the FHLB of Chicago, one of 11 FHLBs that, along with the Office of Finance, compose the FHLB System. The FHLBs are government-sponsored enterprises of the U.S. ("U.S. GSEs") chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership. As such, senior debt obligations of the FHLBs feature the same credit ratings as U.S. Treasury securities and are considered high-quality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes. Consequently, the FHLBs benefit from consistent capital market access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs, which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances. Thus, we consider FHLB advances a stable and reliable funding source for Discover Bank for short-term contingency liquidity and long-term asset-liability management. 

As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, Discover Bank has access to short- and long-term advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to 30 years. At September 30, 2024, we had total committed borrowing capacity of $4.9 billion based on the amount and type of assets pledged, of which $1.0 billion of long-term advances were outstanding with the FHLB of Chicago. Under certain stressed conditions, we could pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value. 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Corporate and Bank Debt 

The following table provides a summary of Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) and Discover Bank outstanding fixed-rate debt (dollars in millions): At September 30, 2024 Principal Amount Outstanding Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate senior notes, maturing 2024-2032 $ 3,350 Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate retail notes, maturing 2025-2031 $ 139 Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed to floating-rate senior notes, maturing 2034 $ 1,000 Discover Bank fixed-rate senior bank notes, maturing 2026-2030 $ 2,800 Discover Bank fixed-rate subordinated bank notes, maturing 2028 $ 500 

At September 30, 2024, $644 million of interest on our fixed-rate debt is due in less than one year and $1.7 billion of interest is due in one year and thereafter. See Note 6: Long-Term Borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the maturities of our long-term borrowings. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

As part of our regular funding strategy, we may, from time to time, borrow short-term funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase ("repo") market through repurchase agreements. Federal funds are short-term, unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a Federal Reserve account. Funds borrowed in the repo market are short-term, collateralized loans, usually secured with highly rated investment securities such as U.S. Treasury bills or notes, or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or U.S. GSEs. At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements. Additionally, we have access to short-term advance structures through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. At September 30, 2024, there were $750 million of short-term advances outstanding from private asset-backed securitizations. 

Additional Funding Sources 

Private Asset-Backed Securitizations 

We have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. While we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations, their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source. Therefore, we reserve some undrawn capacity, informed by our liquidity stress test results, for any contingency funding needs. At September 30, 2024, we had a total committed capacity of $3.5 billion, $750 million of which was drawn. We seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates, renewing them well ahead of their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and seasonal funding needs. 

Federal Reserve 

Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's discount window. As of September 30, 2024, Discover Bank had $46.1 billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged, primarily consumer loans. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingency liquidity. 

Funding Uses 

Our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit to customers, primarily through Discover Bank; the maintenance of sufficient working capital for routine operations; the service of our debt and capital obligations, including interest, principal and dividend payments; and the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio. 

In addition to originating consumer loans to new customers, we also extend credit to existing customers, which primarily arises from agreements for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. At September 30, 2024, our unused credit arrangements were approximately $233.7 billion. These arrangements, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness, loan qualification and the cost of capital. 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts for goods and services, such as consulting, outsourcing, data, sponsorships, software licenses, telecommunications and global merchant acceptance, among other things. These contracts are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including any applicable fixed future cash payments. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have debt obligations, common stock and preferred stock outstanding, for which we incur servicing costs. Refer to "&#8212; Funding Sources" and "&#8212; Capital" for more information related to our debt obligations and capital service, respectively, and the timing of expected payments. 

We assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions, considering primary uses of funding, such as on-balance sheet loans and contingency uses of funding, such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions. To anticipate funding needs under stress, we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic, systemic and hybrid (i.e., idiosyncratic and systemic) scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity. If we determine we have excess cash and cash equivalents above what is required for daily operations, we may invest in highly liquid, unencumbered assets that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using the repo market or other secured borrowing or outright sales. 

Guarantees 

Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that may require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that may require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. In the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 12: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of DFS, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in our credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. 

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (1) 

Standard &#38; Poor's Fitch Ratings Discover Financial Services Senior unsecured debt Baa2 BBB- BBB+ Outlook for Discover Financial Services senior unsecured debt Under Review Positive Positive Discover Bank Senior unsecured debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ Outlook for Discover Bank senior unsecured debt Under Review Positive Positive Subordinated debt Baa1 BBB- BBB Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT)

Aaa(sf) AAA(sf) AAA(sf) 

(1) On February 20, 2024, following the announcement of the pending merger between Discover and Capital One, Moody's Investors Service placed all long-term ratings and assessments for DFS and Discover Bank under review with direction uncertain. 

(2) An "sf" in the rating denotes rating agency identification for structured finance product ratings. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. A credit rating outlook reflects an agency's opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium term, often a period of about a year, and indicates the agency's belief that the issuer's credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time. 

Liquidity 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions. In addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section, we also maintain highly liquid, unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or other secured borrowing or outright sales. 

We maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy, which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business. The Board of Directors approves the policy and the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the "ALCO") is responsible for its implementation. We seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, with having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. The ALCO, chaired by our Treasurer, has cross-functional membership and manages liquidity risk centrally. The ALCO monitors the liquidity risk profiles of DFS and Discover Bank and oversees any actions Corporate Treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs. In addition, the ALCO and our Board of Directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at DFS and Discover Bank, which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our Board of Directors. 

We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We utilize early warning indicators ("EWIs") to detect emerging liquidity stress events. The EWIs include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored daily and reported to the ALCO regularly. A warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decision-making by our senior management team and, in certain instances, may lead to the convening of a senior-level response team and activation of our contingency funding plan. 

In addition, we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed to follow regulatory requirements, including idiosyncratic, systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. These scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at DFS and Discover Bank across a range of periods by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingency liquidity. 

Our primary contingency liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities, which we could sell, repo or borrow against, and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity. In addition, we could borrow FHLB advances by pledging securities to the FHLB of Chicago. Moreover, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides an additional source of contingency liquidity. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to 

satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. In such an environment, we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet, which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity. 

At September 30, 2024, our liquidity portfolio was composed of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve. Short-term investments were primarily comprised of Treasury bills with contractual maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year at the time of acquisition. Investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSEs and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. GSEs. These investments, nearly all of which are classified as available-for-sale, are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them, utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding. The size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based on the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements, market conditions and interest rate risk management objectives. 

At September 30, 2024, our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $77.5 billion, which was $7.8 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2023. Our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities increased primarily as a result of an increase in unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was $23.5 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively. Our liquidity portfolio and undrawn facilities consist of the following (dollars in millions):

Bank Holding Company Liquidity 

The primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated DFS level include debt service obligations (interest payments and return of principal) and capital service and management activities, including dividend payments on capital instruments and the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock. Our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities, as well as dividends from our subsidiaries, notably Discover Bank. Under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress, the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets. In addition, our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from Discover Bank to the bank holding company. 

We utilize a measure referred to as Number of Months of Pre-Funding to determine the length of time DFS can meet upcoming funding obligations, including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources. In managing this metric, we structure our debt maturity schedule to manage prudently the amount of debt maturing within a short period. See Note 6: Long-Term Borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt. 

Capital 

Our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support our businesses' growth, account for their risks, and meet regulatory requirements, rating agency targets and debt investor expectations. Within these constraints, 

we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. 

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, DFS, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum capital levels. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial condition and operating results. We must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations. Current or future legislative or regulatory reforms, such as those related to the adoption of the CECL accounting model or those related to the proposed revisions to the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework ("Basel III rules"), may require us to hold more capital and/or adversely impact our capital level. We consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position. 

DFS and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively, under the Basel III rules. Under these rules, DFS and Discover Bank are classified as "standardized approach" entities as they are U.S. banking organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposures less than $10 billion. The Basel III rules require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. 

In accordance with the final rule on the impact of CECL on regulatory capital, we have elected to phase in the impact over three years, beginning in 2022. By electing this option, our Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratios are higher than they otherwise would have been. The phase-in of the CECL accounting model decreased CET1 by $1.6 billion as of January 1, 2024. For additional information regarding the risk-based capital and leverage ratios, see Note 11: Capital Adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Federal Reserve rules impose limitations on DFS' capital distributions if we do not maintain our risk-based capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests. We are required to assess whether DFS' planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distribution limitations that will apply on a pro-forma basis throughout the planning horizon. 

The SCB requirement is institution-specific and is calculated as the greater of (i) 2.5% and (ii) the sum of (a) the difference between DFS' actual CET1 ratio at the beginning of the forecast and the projected minimum CET1 ratio based on the Federal Reserve's models in its nine-quarter Severely Adverse stress scenario, plus (b) the sum of the dollar amount of DFS' planned common stock dividend distributions for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of its nine-quarter capital planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. For Category IV firms, including DFS, the Federal Reserve calculates each firm's SCB biennially in even-numbered calendar years. In odd-numbered years, each firm subject to Category IV standards that did not opt-in to such year's supervisory stress tests as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process receives an adjusted SCB requirement that is updated to reflect its planned common stock dividends per the firm's annual capital plan. In July 2023, the Federal Reserve disclosed that our SCB was unchanged at 2.5%, effective beginning October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. On April 5, 2024, we submitted our 2024 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. On June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the 2024 CCAR exercise, followed by the release of the final large bank capital requirements on August 28, 2024. Our new SCB requirement increased to 3.1% and is effective from October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025, subject to potential recalculation as discussed herein. 

Under the Basel III rules, a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan under certain circumstances, including a material change in the firm's risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. We determined our entry into the Merger Agreement with Capital One required us to resubmit our capital plan and we submitted our updated capital plan on May 3, 2024. The resubmission process is ongoing. See "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments &#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" for additional information. 

At September 30, 2024, DFS and Discover Bank met the requirements for "well-capitalized" status under the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y and the prompt corrective action rules and corresponding FDIC requirements, respectively, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the applicable rules. 

Basel III rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline. This series of disclosures is commonly referred to as "Pillar 3." The objective is to increase the transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations. We are required 

to make prescribed regulatory disclosures quarterly regarding our capital structure, capital adequacy, risk exposures and risk-weighted assets. We make the Pillar 3 disclosures publicly available on our website in a report called "Basel III Regulatory Capital Disclosures." 

We disclose tangible common equity, which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles. Management believes that common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangibles is meaningful to investors as a measure of our true net asset value. At September 30, 2024, tangible common equity is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure as it is not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations. Other financial services companies may also disclose this measure and definitions may vary. We advise users of this information to exercise caution in comparing this measure among different companies. 

The following table reconciles total common stockholders' equity (a GAAP financial measure) to tangible common equity (dollars in millions): September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (As Restated)

The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory review and other factors. Under the Merger Agreement with Capital One, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock may not exceed $0.70 per share without the prior written consent of Capital One. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation &#8212; Pending Merger with Capital One Financial Corporation to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The declaration and payment of future dividends and the amount thereof are otherwise subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding. No dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period. In addition, as noted above, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases, including limitations on the extent our banking subsidiary (Discover Bank) can provide funds to us through dividends, loans or otherwise. Further, current or future regulatory reforms, such as those that propose to alter the Basel III standards, may require us to hold more capital or could adversely impact our capital level. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no share repurchases. In accordance with the Merger Agreement with Capital One, we have paused share repurchases through the completion of the merger.
