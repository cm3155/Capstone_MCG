FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

First Horizon National Corporation (&#8220;FHN&#8221;) began as a community bank chartered in 1864. FHN's sole class of common stock, $.625 par value, is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange LLC under the symbol FHN. 

FHN is the parent company of First Horizon Bank (formerly First Tennessee Bank National Association ("FTBNA")). First Horizon Bank's principal divisions and subsidiaries operate under the brands of First Horizon Bank, First Horizon Advisors (formerly FTB Advisors), and FHN Financial (formerly FTN Financial or "FTNF"). FHN offers regional banking, wealth management and capital market services through the First Horizon family of companies. First Horizon Bank and First Horizon Advisors provide consumer and commercial banking and wealth management services. FHN Financial, which operates partly through a division of First Horizon Bank and partly through subsidiaries, is an industry leader in fixed income sales, trading, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad. First Horizon Bank has over 270 banking offices in seven southeastern U.S. states, and FHN Financial has 29 offices in 18 states across the U.S. 

FHN is composed of the following operating segments: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Regional banking segment offers financial products and services, including traditional lending and deposit taking, to consumer and commercial customers primarily in the southeast U.S. and other selected markets. Regional banking also provides investments, wealth management, financial planning, trust services and asset management, mortgage banking, credit card, and cash management. Additionally, the regional banking segment includes correspondent banking which provides credit, depository, and other banking related services to other financial institutions nationally. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Fixed income segment consists of fixed income securities sales, trading, underwriting, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad, as well as loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses, expense on subordinated debt issuances, bank-owned life insurance, unallocated interest income associated with excess equity, net impact of raising incremental capital, revenue and expense associated with deferred compensation plans, funds management, tax credit investment activities, derivative valuation adjustments related to prior sales of Visa Class B shares, gain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt, acquisition- and integration-related costs, expenses associated with rebranding initiatives, and various charges related to restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency efforts. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Non-strategic segment consists of run-off consumer lending activities, pre-2009 mortgage banking elements, and the associated ancillary revenues and expenses related to these businesses. Non-strategic also includes the wind-down trust preferred loan portfolio and exited businesses. 

##TABLE_END 

On November 4, 2019, FHN and IBERIABANK Corporation ("IBKC") announced that they had entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which IBKC will merge with FHN in a merger-of-equals transaction. IBKC, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, has 319 offices in 12 states, mostly in the southern and southeastern U.S., and has reported $31.7 billion of total assets, $24.0 billion in loans, and $25.2 billion in deposits, at December 31, 2019. IBKC's common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol IBKC. Under the merger agreement, each share of IBKC common stock will be converted into 4.584 shares of FHN common stock. After closing, FHN expects IBKC common shares will be converted into approximately 44 percent of the then-outstanding shares of FHN common stock. The merger agreement requires FHN to expand its board of directors to seventeen persons; after closing, eight board positions will be held by current IBKC directors, and nine will be held by current FHN directors. FHN expects the transaction to close in mid-2020, subject to regulatory approvals, approval by the shareholders of FHN and of IBKC, and other customary closing conditions. 

On November 8, 2019, FHN announced an agreement for First Horizon Bank to purchase 30 branches from SunTrust Bank in conjunction with SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s merger with BB&#38;T Corporation, which created Truist Financial Corp. As part of the agreement, FHN will assume approximately $2.4 billion of branch deposits for a 3.40 percent deposit premium and purchase approximately $410 million of branch loans. The branches are in communities in North Carolina (20 branches), Virginia (8 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 46 

branches), and Georgia (2 branches). FHN expects the purchase to close in second quarter 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. 

On November 30, 2017, FHN completed its merger with Capital Bank Financial Corporation ("CBF") for an aggregate of 92,042,232 shares of FHN common stock and $423.6 million in cash in a transaction valued at $2.2 billion. I n second quarter 2018, FHN canceled 2,373,220 FHN common shares which had been issued but set aside for certain CBF shareholders who had commenced a dissenter appraisal process. 

In first quarter 2018, FHN divested two branches, including approximately $30 million of deposits and $2 million of loans. The branches, both in Greeneville, Tennessee, were divested in connection with First Horizon's agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and commitments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which were entered into in connection with a customary review of FHN's merger with CBF. 

In second quarter 2018, FHN sold approximately $120 million UPB of its subprime auto loans. These loans, originally acquired as part of the CBF acquisition, did not fit within FHN's risk profile. 

In second quarter 2019, FHN sold a subsidiary acquired as part of the CBF acquisition, that did not fit within FHN's risk profile. The sale resulted in the removal of approximately $25 million UPB of subprime consumer loans from Loans held-for-sale on FHN's Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

On April 3, 2017, FHN Financial acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Coastal Securities, Inc. (&#8220;Coastal&#8221;), a national leader in the trading, securitization, and analysis of Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans, for approximately $131 million in cash. Coastal, which was based in Houston, TX, also traded United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) loans and fixed income products and provided municipal underwriting and municipal advisory services to its clients. Coastal&#8217;s government-guaranteed loan products were combined with FHN Financial's existing SBA trading activities to establish an additional major product sector for FHN Financial. 

In relation to all acquisitions, FHN's operating results include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities subsequent to the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information. 

For the purpose of this management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;), earning assets have been expressed as averages, unless otherwise noted, and loans have been disclosed net of unearned income. The following financial discussion should be read with the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in this report. 

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING UPDATES 

Effective January 1, 2019, FHN adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-02 " Leases " and related ASUs on a prospective basis which resulted in the recognition of approximately $185 million of lease assets and approximately $204 million of lease liabilities. See Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Certain measures are included in the narrative and tables in this MD&#38;A that are &#8220;non-GAAP&#8221;, meaning (under U.S. financial reporting rules) they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the U.S. and also are not codified in U.S. banking regulations currently applicable to FHN. Although other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN for non-GAAP measures, FHN&#8217;s management believes such measures are relevant to understanding the capital position or financial results of FHN. Non-GAAP measures are reported to FHN&#8217;s management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. 

Presentation of regulatory measures, even those which are not GAAP, provide a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions subject to the same regulations as FHN, as demonstrated by their use by banking regulators in reviewing capital adequacy of financial institutions. Although not GAAP terms, these regulatory measures are not considered &#8220;non-GAAP&#8221; under U.S. financial reporting rules as long as their presentation conforms to regulatory standards. Regulatory measures used in this MD&#38;A include: common equity tier 1 capital, generally defined as common equity less goodwill, other intangibles, and certain other required regulatory deductions; tier 1 capital, generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations; and risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), which is a measure of total on- and off-balance sheet assets adjusted for credit and market risk, used to determine regulatory capital ratios. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 47 

The non-GAAP measures presented in this filing are return on average tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;), tangible common equity to tangible assets and adjusted tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets. Refer to table 32 for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP measures and presentation of the most comparable GAAP items. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This MD&#38;A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to FHN&#8217;s beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are not a representation of historical information but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments. The words &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;is likely,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;going forward,&#8221; and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond FHN&#8217;s control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: global, general and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; the stability or volatility of values and activity in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirements for FHN to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; potential claims alleging mortgage servicing failures, individually, on a class basis, or as master servicer of securitized loans; potential claims relating to participation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, competitor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of FHN&#8217;s hedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means directly or indirectly affecting FHN or its customers, business counterparties or competitors; demand for FHN&#8217;s product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which FHN operates; the increasing use of new technologies to interact with customers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets, including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions ("TDFI") and its Commissioner, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221; or &#8220;Fed&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;U.S. Treasury&#8221;), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;Council&#8221;), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible future regulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; current or future Executive orders; changes in laws and regulations applicable to FHN; and FHN&#8217;s success in executing its business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. 

FHN assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made in this Annual Report to Shareholders for the period ended December 31, 2019 of which this MD&#38;A is a part or otherwise from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those presented in this Forward-Looking Statements section, in other sections of this MD&#38;A, in other parts of this Annual Report to Shareholders, or in FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2019 into which this MD&#38;A has been incorporated, and in exhibits to and documents incorporated into the Form 10-K. 

FINANCIAL SUMMARY - 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 

FHN reported net income available to common shareholders of $434.7 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $538.8 million, or $1.65 per diluted share in 2018. In 2019, operating results were impacted by a modest decrease in net interest income and lower noninterest income compared to the prior year. In 2018, operating results were favorably impacted by a $212.9 million pre-tax gain from the sale of FHN&#8217;s remaining Visa Class B shares. In 2019, FHN invested in strategic initiatives, which led to restructuring, rebranding and acquisition-related expenses. Various factors that significantly impacted reported earnings in 2019 included the steady economic environment, efficiency initiatives, prudent investments in key markets as well as strength in our countercyclical fixed income business. Strategic transactions are expected to boost growth, returns and profitability. 

While the economic environment remained relatively strong in 2019, with GDP growth throughout the year, low unemployment rates, and muted inflation, actions by the Federal Reserve, including three interest rate cuts during 2019, placed pressure on FHN&#8217;s net interest income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) and net interest margin (&#8220;NIM&#8221;). Profitable balance sheet growth and strong loan and deposit pricing disciplines helped defend FHN's NII and NIM in this challenging interest rate environment. Additionally, FHN effectively leveraged its key countercyclical fixed income business, capitalizing on lower interest rates and market volatility which led to higher profits within fixed income positively impacting fee income in 2019. 

FHN continued to execute on strategic priorities in 2019 by focusing on higher returns, profitable balance sheet growth in key markets and specialty areas, transforming the customer experience, and optimizing the expense base. Beginning in 2019, FHN initiated a company-wide review of business practices with the goal of optimizing its expense base to improve profitability which resulted in $39.8 million of restructuring charges. FHN invested in technology and infrastructure with enhanced mobile banking and an improved consumer platform, and enhanced its presence with strategic talent in growth markets. Additionally, FHN&#8217;s enhanced focus on efficiency and expense discipline created broad-based cost savings across multiple expense line items. In 2019, management successfully deployed capital through organic loan growth, share repurchases and a dividend increase. 

In fourth quarter 2019, FHN unified the legacy business and Capital Bank brands under the First Horizon name. Additionally, capitalizing on strength and balance sheet capacity from the execution of the CBF acquisition, FHN announced a merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation, as well as, an agreement for First Horizon Bank to purchase 30 branches from SunTrust Bank. These actions led to the recognition of $21.3 million and $39.0 million, respectively of rebranding and acquisition-related charges in 2019, compared with $97.5 million of acquisition expenses in 2018. 

Asset quality trends remained steady in 2019 reflecting steady economic conditions and continued strong credit risk management. The allowance for loan losses increased 11 percent from $180.4 million on December 31, 2018 to $200.3 million on December 31, 2019, primarily driven by commercial loan growth and grade migration. The ratio of annual net charge-offs to average loans were .09 percent for 2019, up slightly from .06 percent for 2018, and the ratio of 30+ delinquencies to total loans declined from .27 percent to .19 percent. 

Return on average common equity (&#8220;ROCE&#8221;) and ROTCE for 2019 were 9.60 percent and 14.71 percent, respectively, compared to 12.75 percent and 20.28 percent in 2018. Return on average assets (&#8220;ROA&#8221;) was 1.08 percent in 2019 compared to 1.38 percent in 2018. The 2018 metrics were favorably impacted by the third quarter 2018 gain on the sale of FHN's remaining Visa Class B shares. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.48 percent in 2019 compared to 7.15 percent in 2018. Common equity tier 1, Tier 1, Total capital, and Leverage ratios were 9.20 percent, 10.15 percent, 11.22 percent, and 9.04 percent on December 31, 2019, compared to 9.77 percent, 10.80 percent, 11.94 percent, and 9.09 percent, respectively, on December 31, 2018. Total period-end assets increased to $43.3 billion on December 31, 2019 from $40.8 billion on December 31, 2018. Total period-end equity was $5.1 billion on December 31, 2019, up from $4.8 billion on December 31, 2018. 

BUSINESS LINE REVIEW - 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 

Regional Banking 

Pre-tax income within the regional banking segment increased 2 percent to $671.1 million in 2019 from $658.3 million in 2018. The increase in pre-tax income was primarily driven by an increase in fee income and lower expenses, somewhat offset by an increase in loan loss provision expense. 

Total revenue increased $16.9 million to $1.5 billion in 2019 driven by an increase in noninterest income. Noninterest income in 2019 increased 6 percent to $329.8 million from $311.8 million in 2018. The increase in noninterest income was largely driven by increases in fees from derivative sales, other service charges, and ATM interchange fees. The increase in ATM interchange fees was primarily driven by the conversion of CBF debit cards to Visa in first quarter 2019. These increases were somewhat offset by lower fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities in 2019 as a result of a decline in NSF fee income and lower cash management fees driven by changes in consumer behavior. NII was flat in 2019 at $1.2 billion. 

Provision expense was $66.1 million and $24.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in provision expense for 2019 was primarily the result of increased reserves due to commercial loan growth, grade migration, three charge-offs, and a relationship that was downgraded in first quarter 2019. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 48 

Noninterest expense decreased 5 percent to $789.0 million in 2019 from $826.3 million in 2018. The decrease in expense was primarily driven by broad-based cost savings across multiple expense categories driven by strategic focus on expense optimization, lower personnel-related expenses and lower FDIC premium expense which decreased in 2019 primarily due to the end of an FDIC assessment surcharge starting with fourth quarter 2018. 

Fixed Income 

Pre-tax income in the fixed income segment was $67.8 million in 2019 compared to $11.1 million in 2018. The improvement in results in 2019 was driven by higher noninterest income which outpaced an increase in expenses and lower NII. 

Noninterest income increased 69 percent, or $113.7 million, to $278.4 million in 2019 from $164.8 million in 2018. Fixed income product revenue increased to $228.4 million in 2019 from $132.3 million in 2018, as average daily revenue (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) increased to $914 thousand in 2019 from $531 thousand in the prior year. The increase in ADR was largely due to declining interest rates and increased market volatility. Other product revenue increased to $50.0 million in 2019 from $32.5 million in 2018, driven by higher fees from derivative and loan sales and an increase in fees for portfolio advisory services. NII was $26.0 million and $35.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decline in NII was due in large part to lower spreads on inventory positions coupled with lower average balances of trading securities compared to the prior year. 

Noninterest expense increased 25 percent, or $47.3 million, to $236.7 million in 2019 from $189.4 million in 2018. The expense increase during 2019 was primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with an increase in fixed income product revenue and a $7.5 million net impact related to the resolution of legal matters recognized in 2019. 

Corporate 

The pre-tax loss for the corporate segment was $195.1 million and $2.9 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. In third quarter 2018, FHN recognized a $212.9 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Visa Class B shares which positively impacted noninterest income for 2018. 

Net interest expense was $40.8 million in 2019 compared to $64.2 million in 2018. Net interest expense was favorably impacted in 2019 by a reduction of market-indexed deposits due to strong lower cost deposit growth in Regional Banking and higher average balances of cash, somewhat offset by lower average balances of investment securities. Noninterest income (including securities gain/losses) was $41.4 million and $239.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in noninterest income in 2019 was driven by the previously mentioned $212.9 million gain from the sale of FHN&#8217;s remaining Visa shares recognized in 2018. Additionally lower dividend income recognized in 2019 compared to 2018 and a $1.8 million decrease in gains on sales of properties also contributed to the decline in noninterest income. These decreases were partially mitigated by higher deferred compensation income driven by equity market valuations. 

Noninterest expense increased to $195.7 million in 2019 from $177.9 million in 2018. The increase in expense for 2019 was primarily driven by $39.8 million of restructuring costs associated with efficiency initiatives, $21.3 million in rebranding expenses, and a $16.1 million increase in deferred compensation expense. Additionally, charitable contributions of $11.0 million made in 2019 also contributed to the overall expense increase in 2019. These increases were somewhat offset by a $58.5 million decrease in acquisition- and integration-related expenses as well as broad-based cost savings driven by strategic-focus on expense optimization compared to the prior year. 

Non-Strategic 

The non-strategic segment had pre-tax income of $41.9 million in 2019 compared to $47.5 million in 2018. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily driven by lower revenues, somewhat offset by lower expenses relative to the prior year. 

Total revenue decreased to $33.1 million in 2019 from $58.3 million in 2018. NII decreased 44 percent to $28.6 million in 2019, primarily due to continued run-off of the loan portfolios. Noninterest income decreased to $4.5 million in 2019 from $7.0 million in 2018. In 2018, FHN recognized $4.1 million of gains on the reversals of previous valuation adjustments related to the sales and payoff of TRUPS loans recognized within the non-strategic segment compared to $1.1 million of gains on the sale and payoff of TRUPS loans in 2019. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 49 

The provision for loan losses within the non-strategic segment was a provision credit of $19.1 million in 2019 compared to a provision credit of $17.6 million in the prior year. Overall, the non-strategic segment continued to reflect stable performance combined with lower loan balances resulting in a $9.8 million decline in reserves to $17.6 million on December 31, 2019. Losses remain historically low as the non-strategic segment had net recoveries of $9.2 million in 2019 compared to net recoveries of $7.2 million a year ago. 

Noninterest expense was $10.2 million in 2019, down from $28.4 million in 2018. The decline in noninterest expense relative to the prior year was primarily the result of an $8.3 million pre-tax expense reversal related to the settlement of litigation matters in 2019. Additionally, lower personnel expenses and legal fees also contributed to the overall decrease in noninterest expense compared to the prior year. 

INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW - 2019 COMPARED TO 2018; 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 

Total consolidated revenue was $1.9 billion, a 4 percent decrease from the prior year, driven by a decrease in noninterest income and lower net interest income. Total consolidated expenses were $1.2 billion, a 1 percent increase from 2018, primarily driven by restructuring and rebranding expense and higher fixed income variable compensation expense, somewhat offset by lower acquisition- and integration-related expenses and broad-based cost savings across multiple line items driven by strategic focus on expense optimization. 

In 2018, total consolidated revenue increased 46 percent, or $610.6 million to $1.9 billion in 2018, driven by a 45 percent increase in NII due to the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank and rate increases and a 47 percent increase in noninterest income primarily due to the gain on the sale of Visa Class B shares. Total consolidated expenses increased 19 percent to $1.2 billion in 2018 from $1.0 billion in 2017. The expense increase was primarily driven by a full-year inclusion of Capital Bank and an increase in acquisition- and integration-related expenses associated with the CBF acquisition. 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income was $1.2 billion in 2019, a 1 percent decrease from 2018. On a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis, NII also decreased 1 percent to $1.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. As detailed in Table 1 - Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income, as an increase in deposit costs and lower loan accretion were mitigated with strong commercial loan and deposit growth and higher loan yields. Average earning assets increased 4 percent to $37.2 billion in 2019 from $35.7 billion in 2018. The increase in average earning assets in 2019 was primarily driven by loan growth. To a much lesser extent an increase in interest-bearing cash also increased average earning assets in 2019, but these increases were somewhat offset by a smaller available-for-sale ("AFS") securities portfolio, a decrease in loans held-for-sale ("HFS") and declines in other earning assets in 2019 relative to the prior year. 

Net interest income increased 45 percent to $1.2 billion in 2018 from $842.3 million in 2017. On a FTE basis, NII increased 44 percent to $1.2 billion in 2018 from $855.9 million in 2017. The increase in NII was largely due to loans added through the CBF acquisition including CBF loan accretion. Additionally, the favorable impact of higher interest rates on loans and higher average balances of available-for-sale securities and trading securities also contributed to the increase in NII, but were somewhat offset by the negative impact of higher market interest rates on deposits and other funding sources. Average earning assets increased 30 percent to $35.7 billion in 2018 from $27.5 billion in 2017. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 was primarily due to the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank, organic loan growth within FHN&#8217;s regional banking activities, a larger securities portfolio, higher average balances of fixed income trading securities and increases in loans HFS. These increases were somewhat offset by continued run-off of the Non-strategic loan portfolios.

(a) The changes in interest due to both rate and volume have been allocated to change due to rate and change due to volume in proportion to the absolute and amounts of the changes in each. 

(b) Variances are computed on a line-by-line basis and are non-additive. 

For purposes of computing yields and the net interest margin, FHN adjusts net interest income to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent pre-tax basis which provides comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The consolidated net interest margin was 3.28 percent in 2019 compared to 3.45 percent in 2018. The net interest spread was 2.90 percent in 2019 compared to 3.15 percent in 2018, and the impact of free funding was 38 basis points and 30 basis points in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in NIM in 2019 relative to 2018 was largely driven by an unfavorable rate environment and lower loan accretion. 

In 2018, the consolidated net interest margin improved to 3.45 percent from 3.12 percent in 2017, largely driven by the result of CBF loan accretion, the positive impact of higher market rates and an increase in average deposits which allowed for reduction in higher cost funding. 

The activity levels and related funding for FHN&#8217;s fixed income activities affect the net interest margin. Generally, fixed income activities compress the margin, especially where there are elevated levels of trading inventory, because of the strategy to reduce market risk by economically hedging a portion of its inventory on the balance sheet. As a result, FHN&#8217;s consolidated margin 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 51 

cannot be readily compared to that of other bank holding companies. Table 2 - Net Interest Margin details the computation of the net interest margin for the past three years.

(a) 2018 increase driven by the adoption of ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" which resulted in the reclassification of interest and dividend income on equity securities to noninterest income on a prospective basis. The remaining balance is primarily comprised of higher-yielding SBA IO strips. 

(b) Calculated using total net interest income adjusted for FTE assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21 percent in 2019 and 2018 and 35 percent in 2017, and where applicable, state income taxes. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 52 

FHN&#8217;s net interest margin is primarily impacted by its balance sheet mix including the levels of fixed and floating rate loans, rate sensitive and non-rate sensitive liabilities, cash levels, trading inventory levels as well as loan fees and cash basis income. FHN&#8217;s balance sheet is positioned to benefit from a rise in short-term interest rates. For 2020, NIM will also depend on the extent of Federal Reserve interest rate increases, loan accretion levels, and the competitive pricing environment for core deposits. 

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES 

The provision for loan losses is the charge to earnings that management determines to be necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management's estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $47.0 million in 2019 compared to $7.0 million in 2018 and $0 million in 2017. The increase in provision expense for 2019 was primarily the result of increased reserves due to commercial loan growth and grade migration. For 2019, FHN's asset quality metrics remained stable. Year-to-date net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were .09 percent and .06 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The ALLL increased $19.9 million from year-end 2018 to $200.3 million as of December 31, 2019. For additional information about the provision for loan losses refer to the Regional Banking and Non-Strategic sections of the Business Line Review section in this MD&#38;A. For additional information about general asset quality trends refer to Asset Quality - Trend Analysis of 2019 Compared to 2018 in this MD&#38;A. 

NONINTEREST INCOME 

Noninterest income (including securities gains/(losses)) was $654.1 million in 2019 compared to $722.8 million in 2018 and $490.2 million in 2017. Noninterest income was 35 percent of total revenue in 2019 compared to 37 percent of total revenue in 2018 and 2017. Noninterest income in 2019 was primarily driven by higher fixed income product revenue. Additionally, market-driven increases in deferred compensation income, increases in derivative sales within the Regional Banking and Fixed Income segments, and higher bank fees relative to 2018 also contributed to noninterest income levels in 2019. For 2018, the increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by a gain on the sale of FHN's remaining Visa Class B shares in third quarter 2018, partially offset by a decrease in fixed income sales revenue. To a lesser extent, the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank in 2018 and a $14.3 million loss from the repurchase of equity securities previously included in a financing transaction recognized in 2017 also contributed to the year-over-year increase in noninterest income. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in fixed income sales revenue in 2018. FHN&#8217;s noninterest income for the last three years is provided in Table 3 - Noninterest Income.

##TABLE_END

Fixed Income Noninterest Income 

The major component of fixed income revenue is generated from the purchase and sale of fixed income securities as both principal and agent. Other noninterest revenues within this line item consist principally of fees from loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales. Securities inventory positions are procured for distribution to customers by the sales staff. Fixed income noninterest income increased 66 percent or $110.9 million, to $278.8 million in 2019 from $167.9 million in 2018, largely due to declining interest rates and increased market volatility. Revenue from other products increased 41 percent, or $14.8 million, to $50.4 million in 2019, largely driven by higher fees from derivative and loan sales, as well as an increase in fees for portfolio advisory services. 

Fixed income noninterest income decreased 23 percent in 2018 to $167.9 million from $216.6 million in 2017, reflecting lower activity due to challenging market conditions (expected interest rate increases, a flattening yield curve, and low levels of market volatility). Revenue from other products decreased 17 percent, or $7.1 million, to $35.6 million from $42.7 million in 2017, largely driven by a decline in fee income from loan sales, somewhat offset by $4.1 million of gains on the sales and payoff of TRUPS loans in the Non-strategic segment and increases in fees from derivative sales.

Deposit Transactions and Cash Management 

Fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities include fees for services related to consumer and commercial deposit products (such as service charges on checking accounts), cash management products and services such as electronic transaction processing (Automated Clearing House and Electronic Data Interchange), account reconciliation services, cash vault services, lockbox processing, and information reporting to large corporate clients. Deposit transactions and cash management activities decreased to $131.7 million in 2019 from $133.3 million in 2018. Lower NSF fee income and cash management fees contributed to the year-over-year decrease in fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities in 2019 compared to the prior year. In 2018, deposit transactions and cash management income increased to $133.3 million from $110.6 million in 2017, largely associated with the inclusion of Capital Bank. Fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities were negatively impacted in first quarter 2017 due to changes in consumer behavior and a modification of billing practices, which further contributed to the year-over-year increase in 2018. 

Brokerage, Management Fees and Commissions 

Brokerage, management fees and commissions include fees for portfolio management, trade commissions, and annuity and mutual funds sales. Noninterest income from brokerage, management fees and commissions increased to $55.5 million in 2019 and $54.8 million in 2018, up from $48.5 million in 2017. The increase was due in large part to the continued growth of FHN&#8217;s advisory business and favorable market conditions. An increase in the sales of structured products also contributed to the increase in 2018. 

Bank-owned Life Insurance 

Income from bank-owned life insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) increased to $19.2 million and $19.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from $15.1 million in 2017. The increases in 2018 and 2019 were driven by higher BOLI policy gains recognized in 2018 and 2019. 

Securities Gains/(Losses) 

Net securities gain/(losses) were not material in 2019 and 2017 compared to $212.9 million in 2018. The 2018 net gain was primarily related to FHN's sale of its remaining holdings of Visa Class B shares. 

Other Noninterest Income 

All other income and commissions includes revenues from other service charges, ATM and interchange fees, revenue related to deferred compensation plans (which are mirrored by changes in noninterest expense), mortgage banking (primarily within the non-strategic and regional banking segments), dividend income, letter of credit fees, electronic banking fees, insurance commissions, gains/(losses) on the extinguishment of debt, and various other fees. 

Revenue from all other income and commissions increased 46 percent or $35.1 million to $111.0 million in 2019 from $75.8 million in 2018. The increase in all other income and commissions was largely due to a $14.4 million increase in deferred compensation income driven by changes in equity market valuations and increases from derivative sales within the Regional Banking segment. Additionally, increases in other service charges and ATM interchange fees also contributed to the increase in all other income and commissions for 2019. Deferred compensation income fluctuates with changes in the market value of the underlying investments and are mirrored by changes in deferred compensation expense which is included in employee compensation expense. These increases were somewhat offset by a $3.4 million decrease in dividend income and a $2.5 million decrease of gains on sales of properties relative to the prior year. 

Revenue from all other income and commissions increased to $75.8 million in 2018 from $43.9 million in 2017. In 2017, FHN recognized a $14.3 million loss from the repurchase of equity securities previously included in a financing transaction which contributed to the year-over-year increase in other noninterest income in 2018. Additionally, effective January 1, 2018, FHN adopted ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" and began recording dividend income from FRB and FHLB holdings in other income which also contributed to the increase in other noninterest income in 2018 relative to the prior year, as previously these amounts were included in Interest income. Increases in mortgage banking income and other service charges related to the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank, $5.5 million in collections from CBF loans that were fully charged off prior to acquisition, and $5.0 million of gains on the sales of properties recognized in 2018 also contributed to the increase in other noninterest income. For 2018, all other income and commissions was unfavorably impacted by a $9.5 million decrease in deferred compensation income. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 56 

NONINTEREST EXPENSE 

Total noninterest expense increased 1 percent, or $9.6 million, to $1.2 billion in 2019. The slight increase in noninterest expenses in 2019 was largely driven by restructuring and rebranding expenses and higher fixed income variable compensation. These increases were somewhat offset by lower acquisition-and integration-related expenses compared to 2018 and broad-based cost saving across multiple line items driven by strategic focus on expense optimization. 

Total noninterest expense increased 19 percent, or $198.3 million, to $1.2 billion in 2018 from $1.0 billion in 2017. The increase in noninterest expenses in 2018 was primarily due to the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank expenses compared to one month of expenses included in 2017. Higher acquisition- and integration-related expenses primarily associated with the CBF acquisition, higher personnel-related expenses, and a smaller repurchase and foreclosure provision expense reversal related to the settlement of certain repurchase claims in 2018 relative to 2017, also contributed to the expense increase in 2018. A decrease in loss accruals related to legal matters in 2018 favorably impacted expense relative to 2017, offsetting a portion of the overall expense increase. 

FHN&#8217;s noninterest expense for the last three years is provided in Table 5 - Noninterest Expense. The discussion following provides additional information about various line items reported in the following table.

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 57 

Employee Compensation, Incentives, and Benefits 

Employee compensation, incentives, and benefits (personnel expense), the largest component of noninterest expense, increased 6 percent, or $37.1 million, to $695.4 million in 2019 from $658.2 million in 2018. The increase in personnel expense was primarily driven by an increase in variable compensation associated with higher fixed income sales revenue and severance-related costs associated with restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency initiatives recognized in 2019. Additionally, a $15.7 million increase in deferred compensation expense driven by equity market valuations also contributed to the increase in personnel expense in 2019. These expense increases were somewhat offset by a $6.2 million decrease in acquisition- and integration-related expenses and a reduction in headcount relative to the prior year. 

Personnel expense increased 12 percent, or $70.8 million, to $658.2 million in 2018 from $587.5 million in 2017, primarily due to a 30 percent increase in headcount in connection with the CBF acquisition. Within the regional banking segment, personnel expense increased due to a $15 hourly wage floor, strategic hires in expansion markets and specialty areas, and higher incentive expense associated with loan and deposit growth. Personnel expense within the fixed income segment decreased in 2018, largely driven by lower variable compensation associated with lower fixed income sales revenue relative to 2017. Additionally, a $10.3 million decrease in deferred compensation expense in 2018 as well as decreases in special performance, acquisition, and integration-related personnel expenses also offset a portion of the increase in personnel expense in 2018 relative to 2017. 

Occupancy 

Occupancy expense decreased to $80.3 million in 2019, from $85.0 million in 2018. The decrease in occupancy expense in 2019 was primarily due to lower lease abandonment expense associated with acquisition- and integration-related expenses in 2019 relative to the prior year. Occupancy expense increased to $85.0 million in 2018 from $54.6 million in 2017, primarily driven by higher rental expense due to the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank. Additionally, FHN recognized $5.3 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses primarily associated with lease abandonment expense in 2018. 

Computer Software 

Computer software expense was $60.7 million and $60.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Computer software increased $12.4 million in 2018 to $60.6 million from $48.2 million in 2017. The increase in computer software expense in 2018 was the result of the inclusion of a full-year of Capital Bank (compared to one month in 2017), as well as FHN&#8217;s focus on technology-related projects. To a lesser extent, acquisition- and integration-related expenses primarily associated with the CBF acquisition also contributed to the increase in computer software expense for 2018. 

Professional Fees 

Professional fees increased $9.4 million to $55.2 million in 2019 from $45.8 million in 2018. In 2019, the increase in professional fees was primarily driven by higher restructuring costs associated with the identification of efficiency opportunities within the organization, strategic initiatives and rebranding expenses recognized in 2019, somewhat offset by lower acquisition- and integration-related expenses relative to 2018. Professional fees decreased to $45.8 million in 2018 from $47.9 million in 2017. In 2018, the decrease in professional fees was due to lower acquisition- and integration-related expenses primarily associated with the CBF acquisition relative to 2017, somewhat offset by strategic investments to analyze growth potential and product mix for new markets. 

Operations Services 

Operations services expense decreased 18 percent, or $10.3 million to $46.0 million in 2019 from $56.3 million in 2018, primarily driven by vendor consolidation following the completion of integration of the CBF merger. Additionally, lower acquisition- and integration-related expenses also contributed to the decrease in 2019 compared to the prior year. Operations services expense was $56.3 million in 2018 compared $43.8 million in 2017. The increase in operations services expense was primarily related to an increase in third party fees associated with the inclusion of Capital Bank operating expenses, as well as higher acquisition- and integration-related expenses primarily related to the CBF acquisition. 

Advertising and Public Relations 

Expenses associated with advertising and public relations increased to $34.4 million from $24.8 million in 2018 and $19.2 million in 2017. In 2019, FHN recognized higher advertising expense due in large part to FHN&#8217;s rebranding initiative, as well 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 58 

as promotional branding campaigns and target marketing in new markets. The increase in 2018 relative to 2017 was due in large part to promotional branding campaigns and targeted marketing in new markets. 

Equipment Rentals, Depreciation, and Maintenance 

Equipment rentals, depreciation, and maintenance expense decreased 13 percent, or $5.1million, to $34.0 million for 2019, from $39.1 million in 2018. The decrease in equipment rentals, depreciation, and maintenance expense in both periods was due in large part to branch optimization, consolidation efforts and planned CBF merger synergies. Equipment rentals, depreciation, and maintenance expense was $39.1 million in 2018 compared to $29.5 million in 2017. The increase in equipment rentals, depreciation, and maintenance expense in was due in large part to the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank in 2018 and higher acquisition- and integration-related expenses primarily related to the CBF acquisition. 

Communication and Courier 

Expenses associated with communications and courier decreased 16 percent, or $5.0 million, to $25.1 million in 2019 from $30.0 million in 2018, primarily driven by branch optimization, vendor consolidation efforts and planned CBF merger synergies. Additionally, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition- and integration-related expenses also contributed to the expense decrease in 2019. Expenses associated with communication and courier increased to $30.0 million in 2018 from $17.6 million in 2017, primarily driven by the full-year inclusion of Capital Bank in 2018. To a lesser extent, an increase in acquisition- and integration-related expenses also contributed to the expense increase in 2018. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets 

Amortization expense was $24.8 million in 2019, compared to $25.9 million in 2018 and $8.7 million in 2017. The increase in amortization expense from 2017 was primarily due to the full-year inclusion of intangibles related to the Capital Bank acquisition in 2018. 

FDIC Premium Expense 

FD IC premium expense decreased 37 percent, or $11.8 million from $31.6 million in 2018 to $19.9 million in 2019. The decrease in FDIC premium expense is primarily due to the end of an FDIC assessment surcharge starting with fourth quarter 2018. FDIC premium expense increased to $31.6 million in 2018 from $26.8 million in 2017 primarily due to the CBF acquisition, as well as organic growth. In fourth quarter 2018, the FDIC assessment surcharge initiated in third quarter 2016 expired offsetting a portion of the overall increase in FDIC premium expense for 2018. 

Legal Fees 

Legal fees increased to $16.9 million in 2019 from $11.1 million in 2018 and $12.1 million in 2017. Legal fees fluctuate primarily based on the status, timing, type, and composition of cases or other projects. 

Contract Employment and Outsourcing 

Expenses associated with contract employment and outsourcing decreased 31 percent, or $5.7 million to $12.9 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the completion of acquisition- and integration- related projects primarily associated with the CBF acquisition. Expenses associated with contract employment and outsourcing increased 24 percent, or $3.6 million, to $18.5 million in 2018 compared to $15.0 million in 2017, primarily driven by acquisition- and integration-related projects primarily associated with the CBF acquisition. 

Other Noninterest Expense 

Other expense includes travel and entertainment expense, other insurance and tax expense, customer relations expense, supplies, employee training and dues, miscellaneous loan costs, losses from litigation and regulatory matters, expenses associated with the non-service components of net periodic pension and post-retirement cost, tax credit investments, expenses associated with OREO, expenses/expense reversals associated with FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure provision, and various other expenses. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 59 

All other expense decreased $8.9 million to $126.1 million in 2019 from $135.0 in 2018, primarily due to a $38.3 million decrease in acquisition- and integration-related expenses. FHN&#8217;s strategic focus on expense optimization also contributed to the overall decline in other noninterest expense in 2019, but was somewhat offset by a $23.1 million increase in costs associated with restructuring and rebranding initiatives primarily related to assets impairments. Additionally, a $10.8 million increase in charitable contributions, as well as increases in customer relations and loss accruals related to legal matters, somewhat offset a portion of the overall expense decline in 2019. 

All other expense was $135.0 million in 2018 compared to $112.6 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $35.8 million increase of acquisition- and integration-related costs primarily associated with the CBF acquisition, including contract termination charges, costs of shareholder matters and asset impairments related to the integration, as well as other miscellaneous expenses. A smaller pre-tax expense reversal of mortgage repurchase and foreclosure provision in 2018 compared to 2017 also contributed to the increase in all other expense in 2018. Additionally, a $4.1 million increase in Visa derivative valuation adjustments recognized in 2018, higher expenses associated with travel and entertainment, supplies, and employee training and dues largely due to the inclusion of Capital Bank, higher pension expense and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments also contributed to the increase in other noninterest expense relative to the prior year. These expense increases were largely offset by a $39.9 million net decrease in loss accruals related to legal matters and $8.8 million of charitable contributions made to FHN's foundation in 2017. 

INCOME TAXES 

FHN recorded an income tax provision of $133.3 million in 2019, compared to $157.6 million in 2018 and $131.9 million in 2017. The effective tax rates for 2019, 2018, and 2017 were approximately 22.8 percent, 22.1 percent, and 42.7 percent, respectively. 

The increase in the effective tax rates in 2019 compared to 2018 was related to a $5.1 million decrease in net discrete tax benefits realized during 2019. The larger discrete tax benefit in 2018 was primarily related to trailing benefits from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act &#8220;Tax Act,&#8221; which lowered the statutory rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective January 1, 2018. 

The decrease in the effective tax rates in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act. The tax rate in 2017 was adversely affected by approximately $82 million of tax expense primarily related to the revaluation of the net deferred tax asset based on a 21 percent tax rate as a result of the passage of the Tax Act in 2017. This was partially offset by the reversal of a capital loss valuation allowance which decreased federal and state taxes by $40.4 million. 

&#160; 

The company&#8217;s effective tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and tax credits and other tax benefits from affordable housing investments. The company&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. 

A deferred tax asset (&#8220;DTA&#8221;) or deferred tax liability (&#8220;DTL&#8221;) is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. As of December 31, 2019, FHN&#8217;s net DTA was $69.0 million compared with $127.9 million at December 31, 2018 and $221.8 million at December 31, 2017. 

As of December 31, 2019, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $43.8 million and $1.2 million, which will expire at various dates. Refer to Note 15 - Income Taxes for additional information. 

FHN&#8217;s gross DTA after valuation allowance was $250.6 million and $254.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Based on current analysis, FHN believes that its ability to realize the remaining DTA is more likely than not. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. A significant adverse change in FHN&#8217;s taxable earnings outlook could result in the need for a valuation allowance. 

FHN and its eligible subsidiaries are included in a consolidated federal income tax return. FHN files separate returns for subsidiaries that are not eligible to be included in a consolidated federal income tax return. Based on the laws of the applicable states where it conducts business operations, FHN either files consolidated, combined, or separate returns. FHN&#8217;s federal 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 60 

consolidated tax returns are currently under audit for 2013 through 2015 and the statutes for those years have been extended through December 31, 2020. Federal tax refund claims for Capital Bank Financial Corporation for 2010 - 2012 are under examination by the IRS. Several of FHN&#8217;s state returns are currently under examination. See Note 15 - Income Taxes for additional information. 

RESTRUCTURING, REPOSITIONING, AND EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES 

Beginning in first quarter 2019, FHN initiated a company-wide review of business practices with the goal of optimizing its expense base to improve profitability and create capacity to reinvest savings into technology and revenue production activities. The net charges for restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency initiatives were $39.8 million in 2019, primarily associated with professional fees, asset impairments, and severance and other employee costs. Due to the broad nature of the actions being taken, many components of expense are expected to benefit from the current efficiency initiatives. See Note 25 - Restructuring, Repositioning, and Efficiency for additional information. 

STATEMENT OF CONDITION REVIEW - 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 

Total period-end assets were $43.3 billion on December 31, 2019 , up 6 percent from $40.8 billion on December 31, 2018. Average assets increased 4 percent to $41.7 billion in 2019 from $40.2 billion in 2018. The increase in period-end assets was primarily driven by strong loan growth. Additionally, an increase in securities purchased under agreement to resell and a net increase in non-earning assets (including right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets) also contributed to the increase in period-end assets. These increases were somewhat offset by a net decrease in other earning assets (primarily interest-bearing cash), AFS securities, and loans HFS. The increase in average assets was also primarily driven by strong loan growth, somewhat offset by decreases in AFS securities, loans HFS, and a net decrease in other earning assets. Effective January 1, 2019, FHN adopted ASU 2016-02, &#8220; Leases &#8221; and all related ASUs and began recording ROU lease assets and lease liabilities in Other assets and Other liabilities which contributed to the increase in period-end and average assets and liabilities in 2019 relative to the prior year. 

Total period-end liabilities were $38.2 billion on December 31, 2019 , a 6 percent increase from $36.0 billion on December 31, 2018, driven by a net increase in short-term borrowings (primarily other short-term borrowings) and lease liabilities, somewhat offset by decreases in term borrowings and deposits. Average liabilities increased 3 percent to $36.8 billion in 2019, from $35.6 billion in 2018. The increase in average liabilities was largely driven by higher deposit levels in 2019 and the addition of lease liabilities, somewhat offset by a net decrease in short-term borrowings in 2019 relative to the prior year. 

EARNING ASSETS 

Earning assets consist o f loans, investment securities, other earning assets such as trading securities, interest-bearing cash, and loans HFS. Average earning assets increased to $37.2 billion in 20 19 from $35.7 billion in 2018. A more detailed discussion of the major line items follows. 

Loans 

Period-end loans were $31.1 billion on December 31, 2019 , up from $27.5 billion on December 31, 2018 . Average loans increased $2.0 billion to $29.2 billion in 2019 from $27.2 billion in 2018. The increase in period-end and average loan balances compared to the prior year was primarily due to strong loan growth within the Regional Banking portfolios. 

In third quarter 2019, FHN corrected a previous mis-classification of commercial loans and reclassified approximately $410 million of market investor CRE loans from the C&#38;I portfolio to the CRE portfolio. These loans were identified during an internal review and assessment by management of certain loan populations, a portion of which relate to loans acquired as part of the Capital Bank merger. The reclassification of these loan balances between regional banking portfolios did not have an impact on FHN&#8217;s consolidated period-end or average balance sheet and had an immaterial effect on the allowance for loan losses. No adjustments were made to prior periods as the impact of the reclassification, including the effect on the allowance for loan losses was deemed to be immaterial in all periods. 

The following table provides detail regarding FHN's average loans.

2019 , 2018 and 2017 include $12.4 million, $19.3 million, and $29.3 million of restricted and secured real estate loans, respectively. 

##TABLE_END

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan portfolio comprising 63 percent of total loans in 2019 and 58 percent in 2018. C&#38;I loans increased 15 percent, or $2.4 billion, from 2018, largely driven by strong loan growth within the mortgage warehouse lending and commercial portfolios of Regional Banking. Growth in other specialty lending areas within Regional Banking, such as energy and healthcare also meaningfully contributed to the overall growth in average C&#38;I loans in 2019 compared to 2018. Commercial real estate loans experienced a net decrease of 2 percent to $4.1 billion in 2019, primarily driven by loan payoffs and strategic run-off. 

Average consumer loans declined 5 percent, or $.3 billion, from 2018 to $6.8 billion in 2019, largely driven by declines in real estate installment loans and home equity lines of credit within the Regional Banking segment, and continued wind-down of portfolios within the Non-strategic segment.

##TABLE_END

Because of various factors, the contractual maturities of consumer loans are not indicative of the actual lives of such loans. A significant component of FHN&#8217;s loan portfolio consists of consumer real estate loans - a majority of which are home equity lines of credit and home equity installment loans. Typical home equity lines originated by FHN are variable rate 5/15, 10/10, or 10/20 lines. In a 5/15 line, a borrower may draw on the loan for 5 years and pay interest only during that period (&#8220;the draw period&#8221;), and for the next 15 years the customer pays principal and interest and may no longer draw on that line. A 10/10 loan has a 10 year draw period followed by a 10-year principal-and-interest repayment period, and a 10/20 loan has a 10 year draw period followed by a 20-year principal-and-interest repayment period. Therefore, the contractual maturity for 5/15 and 10/10 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 62 

home equity lines is 20 years and the contractual maturity for 10/20 home equity lines is 30 years. Numerous factors can contribute to the actual life of a home equity line or installment loan. As a result, the actual average life of home equity lines and loans is difficult to predict and changes in any of these factors could result in changes in projections of average lives. 

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment portfolio consists principally of debt securities including government agency issued mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) and government agency issued collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMO&#8221;), substantially all of which are classified as AFS. FHN utilizes the securities portfolio as a source of income, liquidity and collateral for repurchase agreements, for public funds, and as a tool for managing risk of interest rate movements. Table 8 - Contractual Maturities of Investment Securities on December 31, 2019 (Amortized Cost) shows information pertaining to the composition, yields, and contractual 

maturities of the investment portfolio. Investment securities were $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion on December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Average investment securities were $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion in 2019 and 2018, representing 12 percent and 13 percent of average earning assets in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in period-end and average investment securities was driven by FHN's reinvestment strategy in 2019. A portion of this decrease was somewhat offset by unrealized gains within the securities portfolio driven by lower interest rates in 2019 relative to the prior year. FHN manages the size and mix of the investment portfolio to assist in asset liability management, provide liquidity, and optimize risk adjusted returns. 

Government agency issued MBS, CMO, and other agencies averaged $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. U.S. treasury securities and corporate and municipal bonds averaged $102.4 million in 2019 compared to $76.5 million in 2018. On December 31, 2019, AFS investment securities had $41.3 million of net unrealized gains compared to $100.6 million of net unrealized losses on December 31, 2018. See Note 3 - Investment Securities for additional detail.

##TABLE_END

(a) Represents government agency-issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which, when adjusted for early pay downs, have an estimated average life of 4.3 years. 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

Loans HFS consists of small business, other consumer loans, the mortgage warehouse, USDA, student, and home equity loans . The average balance of loans HFS decreased to $578.0 milli on in 2019 from $724.0 million in 2018. On December 31, 2019 , loans HFS were $593.8 millio n compared to $679.1 million on December 31, 2018. The decrease in period-end an d average loans HFS was primarily driven by decreases in small business loans, somewhat offset by increases in USDA loans. In second quarter 2019, the sale of a subsidiary resulted in the removal of approximately $25 million UPB of subprime consumer loans which also contributed to the decrease in both period-end and average balances, but was somewhat offset by the remaining UPB related to a mortgage lending relationship that converted to the underlying collateral during third quarter 2019. 

Other Earning Assets 

Other earning assets include trading securities, securities purchased under agreements to resell ("asset repos"), federal funds sold (&#8220;FFS&#8221;), and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other financial institutions. Other earning assets averaged $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as decreases in asset repos and fixed income trading securities were largely offset by an increase in interest-bearing cash. Asset repos are used in fixed income trading activity and generally fluctuate with the level of fixed income trading liabilities (short-positions) as securities collateral from asset repo transactions are used to fulfill trades. Fixed income's trading inventory fluctuates daily based on customer demand. Other earning assets were $2.5 billion and $3.3 billion on December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decline in other earning assets on a period-end basis was primarily driven by decreases in interest-bearing cash and federal funds sold, somewhat offset by an increase in asset repos. The decrease in interest-bearing cash at year-end 2019 was primarily driven by strong loan growth and balance sheet funding strategies. 

The following table summarizes FHN's average other earning assets for 2019, 2018, and 2017.

##TABLE_END

(a) 2017 includes the average impact of one month of balances related to the CBF acquisition. 

Non-earning assets 

Period-end non-earning assets increased to $4.7 billion on December 31, 2019 from $4.6 billion on December 31, 2018. The increase was due to the recognition of ROU assets associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-02, " Leases ," and increases in derivative assets and LIHTC investments, partially offset by decreases in cash and net deferred tax assets. 

Deposits 

Average deposits were $32.4 billion during 2019, up 5 percent from $30.9 billion during 2018. The increase in average deposits was largely due to FHN's strategic focus on growing deposits. As noted in the table below, the composition of deposits remained relatively consistent in 2019, with interest-bearing deposits comprising 75 percent of total deposits. Market-indexed deposits as a percentage of total deposits decreased from 15 percent in 2018 to 13 percent in 2019, while commercial interest deposits increased as a percentage of total deposits. 

Period-end deposits were $32.4 billion on December 31, 2019, down 1 percent from $32.7 billion on December 31, 2018. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in market-indexed deposits which more than offset an influx of consumer interest deposits and non-interest bearing deposits. The following table summarizes FHN's average deposits for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

(b) Market-indexed deposits are tied to an index not administered by FHN and are comprised of insured network deposits, correspondent banking deposits, and trust/sweep deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings (federal funds purchased (&#8220;FFP&#8221;)), securities sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities, and other short-term borrowings) averaged $2.5 billion in 2019 and $2.8 billion in 2018. As noted in the table below, the decrease in short-term borrowings was largely due to decreases in other short-term borrowings and trading liabilities. Other short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. Trading liabilities fluctuate based on levels of trading securities and hedging strategies. Federal funds purchases increased in 2019, as an additional source of wholesale funding for FHN's balance sheet 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 64 

activities. Period-end short-term borrowings were $4.0 billion on December 31, 2019 and $1.5 billion on December 31, 2018. The increase in period-end short-term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in FHLB borrowings. Additionally, increases in FFP and trading liabilities also contributed to the increase in short-term borrowings on December 31, 2019. FFP fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. See Note 9 - Short-Term Borrowings for additional information. 

The following table summarizes FHN's average short-term borrowings for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

(a) 2017 includes the average impact of one month of balances related to the CBF acquisition. 

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Average term borrowings were $1.1 billion in 2019 and $1.2 billion in 2018. Term borrowings were $.8 billion on December 31, 2019, down from $1.2 billion on December 31, 2018. The decrease in period-end and average term borrowings was primarily driven by the redemption of $400.0 million senior debt in fourth quarter 2019. See Note 10 - Term Borrowings for additional information. 

Other Liabilities 

Period-end other liabilities were $1.0 billion on December 31, 2019, up from $.7 billion on December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of lease liabilities associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-02, " Leases " and an increase in fixed income payables, somewhat offset by a decrease in derivative liabilities. 

CAPITAL - 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 

Management&#8217;s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to well-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. Period-end equity increased to $5.1 billion on December 31, 2019 from $4.8 billion on December 31, 2018. Average equity increased to $4.9 billion in 2019 from $4.6 billion in 2018. The increase in period-end and average equity was due to net income recognized in 2019, somewhat offset by common and preferred dividends paid and share repurchases (mentioned below). A decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") also contributed to the increase in period-end and average equity and was largely the result of a decrease in unrealized losses associated with AFS debt securities.

(a) Tangible common equity to tangible assets and Adjusted tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled to Total equity to total assets (GAAP) in the Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation - Table 32. 

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.5 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. Furthermore, beginning January 1, 2019, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. As of December 31, 2019 , each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as well-capitalized institutions and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios decreased in 2019 relative to 2018 primarily due to increased risk-weighted assets driven by loan growth which was partially offset by the impact of net income less dividends and share repurchases during in 2019. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was relatively flat for both FHNC and First Horizon Bank as average assets for leverage in fourth quarter of 2019 increased relative to fourth quarter of 2018. During 2020, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards. 

Stress Testing 

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, along with an interagency regulatory statement effectively exempted both FHN and FTBNA from Dodd-Frank Act ("DFA") stress testing requirements starting with 2018. 

For 2019, even though no longer required, FHN and First Horizon Bank completed a stress test using DFA scenarios and requirements previously in effect. Results of these tests indicate that both FHN and First Horizon Bank would be able to maintain capital well in excess of Basel III Adequately Capitalized standards under the hypothetical severe global recession of the 2019 DFA Severely Adverse scenario. A summary of those results was posted in the &#8220;News &#38; Events-Stress Testing Results&#8221; section on FHN&#8217;s investor relations website on December 6, 2019. Neither FHN&#8217;s stress test posting, nor any other material found on FHN&#8217;s website generally, is part of this report or incorporated herein. 

First Horizon will continue performing an annual enterprise wide stress test as part of its capital and risk management process. Results of this test will be presented to executive management and the board. 

The disclosures in this &#8220;Stress Testing&#8221; section include forward-looking statements. Please refer to &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; for additional information concerning the characteristics and limitations of statements of that type.

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

Pursuant to board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Two common stock purchase programs currently authorized are discussed below. FHN&#8217;s board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

Table 13a&#8212;Issuer Purchases of Common Stock - General Authority 

On January 23, 2018, FHN announced a $250 million share purchase authority with an expiration date of January 31, 2020. On January 29, 2019, FHN announced a $250 million increase in that authority along with an extension of the expiration date to January 31, 2021. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to market conditions, accumulation of excess equity, prudent capital management, and legal and regulatory restrictions. As of December 31, 2019, $229.3 million in purchases had been made under this authority at an average price per share of $15.09, $15.07 excluding commissions. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during the first half of 2020 due to the pending merger of equals with IBKC.

Table 13b&#8212;Issuer Purchase of Common Stock - Compensation Authority 

A consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on August 6, 2004. This program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program, inclusive of a program amendment on April 24, 2006, is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion which relates to compensation plans for which no options remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option exercise period of the various compensation plans on or before December 31, 2023. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to market conditions, accumulation of excess equity, prudent capital management, and legal and regulatory restrictions. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was 24.5 million shares. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2020.

ASSET QUALITY - TREND ANALYSIS OF 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 

Loan Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans are composed of commercial, financial, and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) and commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;). Consumer loans are composed of consumer real estate; permanent mortgage; and credit card and other. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans (20 percent of total loans), the majority of which is in the consumer real estate portfolio (19 percent of total loans). Industry concentrations are discussed under the heading C&#38;I below. 

Underwriting Policies and Procedures 

The following sections describe each portfolio as well as general underwriting procedures for each. As economic and real estate conditions develop, enhancements to underwriting and credit policies and procedures may be necessary or desirable. Loan policies and procedures for all portfolios are reviewed by credit risk working groups and management risk committees comprised of business line managers and credit administration professionals as well as by various other reviewing bodies within FHN. Policies and procedures are approved by key executives and/or senior managers leading the applicable credit risk working groups as well as by management risk committees. The credit risk working groups and management risk committees strive to ensure that the approved policies and procedures address the associated risks and establish reasonable underwriting criteria that appropriately mitigate risk. Policies and procedures are reviewed, revised and re-issued periodically at established review dates or earlier if changes in the economic environment, portfolio performance, the size of portfolio or industry concentrations, or regulatory guidance warrant an earlier review. For example, in 2017 FHN expanded its borrower limits in association with the expansion of its overall portfolio through the acquisition of CBF and revised its Portfolio Concentration, Country Exposure, and Automated Clearing House limits to more appropriately align with its overall risk appetite and to provide more granularity into some of its portfolio sub segments. Additionally, in 2019 FHN expanded borrower limits within certain portfolios (such as loans to mortgage companies) to support FHN's strategic plan. These changes were approved by management risk committees and the Executive and Risk Committee of the Board in order to enhance and support loan growth while also minimizing incremental credit risk. 

COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIOS 

FHN&#8217;s commercial loan approval process grants lending authority based upon job description, experience, and performance. The lending authority is delegated to the business line (Market Managers, Departmental Managers, Regional Presidents, Relationship Managers (&#8220;RM&#8221;) and Portfolio Managers (&#8220;PM&#8221;)) and to Credit Risk Managers. While individual limits vary, the predominant amount of approval authority is vested with the Credit Risk Management function. Portfolio, industry, and borrower concentration limits for the various portfolios are established by executive management and approved by the Executive and Risk Committee of the Board. 

FHN&#8217;s commercial lending process incorporates an RM and a PM for most commercial credits. The RM is primarily responsible for communications with the customer and maintaining the relationship, while the PM is responsible for assessing the credit quality of the borrower, beginning with the initial underwriting and continuing through the servicing period. Other specialists and the assigned RM/PM are organized into units called deal teams. Deal teams are constructed with specific job attributes that facilitate FHN&#8217;s ability to identify, mitigate, document, and manage ongoing risk. PMs and credit analysts provide enhanced analytical support during loan origination and servicing, including monitoring of the financial condition of the borrower and tracking compliance with loan agreements. Loan closing officers and the construction loan management unit specialize in loan documentation and the management of the construction lending process. FHN strives to identify problem assets early through comprehensive policies and guidelines, targeted portfolio reviews, more frequent servicing on lower rated borrowers, and an emphasis on frequent grading. For smaller commercial credits, generally $3 million or less, FHN utilizes a centralized underwriting unit in order to originate and grade small business loans more efficiently and consistently. 

FHN may utilize availability of guarantors/sponsors to support commercial lending decisions during the credit underwriting process and when determining the assignment of internal loan grades. Reliance on the guaranty as a viable secondary source of repayment is a function of an analysis proving capability to pay, factoring in, among other things, liquidity and direct/indirect

cash flows. FHN also considers the volume and amount of guaranties provided for all global indebtedness and the likelihood of realization. FHN presumes a guarantor&#8217;s willingness to perform until there is any current or prior indication or future expectation that the guarantor may not willingly and voluntarily perform under the terms of the guaranty. In FHN&#8217;s risk grading approach, it is deemed that financial support becomes necessary generally at a point when the loan would otherwise be graded substandard, reflecting a well-defined weakness. At that point, provided willingness and capacity to support are appropriately demonstrated, a strong, legally enforceable guaranty can mitigate the risk of default or loss, justify a less severe rating, and consequently reduce the level of allowance or charge-off that might otherwise be deemed appropriate. 

C&#38;I 

The C&#38;I portfolio was $20.1 billion on December 31, 2019 , and is comprised of loans used for general business purposes . Typical products include working capital lines of credit, term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit. The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of December 31, 2019 , are in Tennessee (31 percent), North Carolina (10 percent), California (9 percent), Texas (6 percent), Florida (6 percent), Georgia (4 percent), and South Carolina (3 percent), with no other state representing more than 3 percent of the portfolio. 

C&#38;I loans are underwritten in accordance with a well-defined credit origination process. This process includes applying minimum underwriting standards as well as separation of origination and credit approval roles on transaction sizes over PM authorization limits. Underwriting typically includes due diligence of the borrower and the applicable industry of the borrower, analysis of the borrower&#8217;s available financial information, identification and analysis of the various sources of repayment and identification of the primary risk attributes. Stress testing the borrower&#8217;s financial capacity, adherence to loan documentation requirements, and assigning credit risk grades using internally developed scorecards are also used to help quantify the risk when appropriate. Underwriting parameters also include loan-to-value ratios (&#8220;LTVs&#8221;) which vary depending on collateral type, use of guaranties, loan agreement requirements, and other recommended terms such as equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Approval decisions also consider various financial ratios and performance measures of the borrowers, such as cash flow and balance sheet leverage, liquidity, coverage of fixed charges, and working capital. Additionally, approval decisions consider the capital structure of the borrower, sponsorship, and quality/value of collateral. Generally, guideline and policy exceptions are identified and mitigated during the approval process. Pricing of C&#38;I loans is based upon the determined credit risk specific to the individual borrower. These loans typically have variable rates tied to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) or the prime rate of interest plus or minus the appropriate margin. 

The following table provides the composition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (&#8220;NAICS&#8221;) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. 36 percent of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I portfolio (Finance and insurance plus Loans to mortgage companies) could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services industry. Except &#8220;Loans to Mortgage Companies&#8221; and &#8220;Finance and Insurance&#8221;, as discussed below, on December 31, 2019 , FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10 percent or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

The balance of loans to mortgage companies was 22 percent of the C&#38;I portfolio as of December 31, 2019 , and 12 percent of the C&#38;I portfolio as of December 31, 2018 , and includes balances related to both home purchase and refinance activity. This portfolio class, which generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors, includes commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Generally, lending to mortgage lenders increases when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decreases when rates rise. The increase in loans to mortgage companies year over year was due to higher home purchasing and refinance activity, as well as market share growth. In 2019, 60 percent of the loans funded were home purchases and 40 percent were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represents 14 percent of the C&#38;I portfolio and includes TRUPS (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of December 31, 2019 , asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represents approximately $1.2 billion of the finance and insurance component. 

TRUPS lending was originally extended as a form of &#8220;bridge&#8221; financing to participants in the pooled trust preferred securitization program offered primarily to smaller banking (generally less than $15 billion in total assets) and insurance institutions through FHN&#8217;s fixed income business. Origination of TRUPS lending ceased in early 2008. Individual TRUPS are re-graded at least quarterly as part of FHN&#8217;s commercial loan review process. During second quarter 2018, FHN revised the grading approach associated with the TRUPS portfolio to align with its scorecard grading methodologies which resulted in upgrades to a majority of this portfolio. The terms of these loans generally include a scheduled 30 year balloon payoff and include an option to defer interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters. As of December 31, 20 18, one TRUP relationship was on interest deferral. This relationship returned to accrual in fourth quarter 2019. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the UPB of trust preferred loans totaled $238.4 million ($177.7 million of bank TRUPS and $60.7 million of insurance TRUPS) with the UPB of other bank-related loans totaling $304.6 million. Inclusive of a valuation allowance on TRUPS of $ 19.1 million , total reserves (ALLL plus the valuation allowance) for TRUPS and other bank-related loans were $19.4 million or 4 percent of outstanding UPB. 

C&#38;I Asset Quality Trends 

Overall, the C&#38;I portfolio trends remained strong in 2019, continuing in line with recent historical performance. The C&#38;I ALLL increased $23.5 million from December 31, 2018, to $122.5 million as of December 31, 2019 . The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans increased to .61 percent as of December 31, 2019 , from .60 percent as of December 31, 2018. Nonperforming C&#38;I loans increased $34.5 million from December 31, 2018, to $74.3 million on December 31, 2019 , primarily driven by three credits which were partially offset by payments, returns to accrual status, or other resolutions. The nonperforming loan (&#8220;NPL&#8221;) ratio increased 13 basis points from December 31, 2018, to .37 percent of C&#38;I loans as of December 31, 2019 . The 30+ delinquency ratio decreased to .05 percent as of December 31, 2019 , from .06 percent as of December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs were $27.0 million in 2019 compared to $11.3 million in 2018, primarily driven by two credits. The following table shows C&#38;I asset quality trends by segment.

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 70 

Commercial Real Estate 

The CRE portfolio was $4.3 billion on December 31, 2019 . The CRE portfolio includes both financings for commercial construction and nonconstruction loans. The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of December 31, 2019 , are in North Carolina (29 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), Florida (12 percent), Texas (9 percent), South Carolina (8 percent), and Georgia (6 percent), with no other state representing more than 3 percent of the portfolio. This portfolio is segregated between the income-producing CRE and residential CRE classes. The income-producing CRE class contains loans and draws on lines and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-permanent financing of income-producing real estate. Subcategories of income CRE consist of office (28 percent), multi-family (20 percent), retail (19 percent), industrial (14 percent), hospitality (11 percent), land/land development (2 percent) and other (6 percent). 

The residential CRE class includes loans to residential builders and developers for the purpose of constructing single-family homes, condominiums, and town homes, and on a limited basis, for developing residential subdivisions. Subsequent to the Capital Bank merger completed in 2017, active residential CRE lending is now primarily focused in certain core markets. Nearly all new originations are to &#8220;strategic&#8221; clients. FHN considers a &#8220;strategic&#8221; residential CRE borrower as a homebuilder who demonstrates the ability to withstand cyclical downturns, maintains active development and investment activities providing for regular financing opportunities, and is fundamentally sound as evidenced by a prudent loan structure, appropriate covenants and recourse, and capable and willing sponsors in markets with positive homebuilding and economic dynamics. 

Income CRE loans are underwritten in accordance with credit policies and underwriting guidelines that are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary based on market conditions. Loans are underwritten based upon project type, size, location, sponsorship, and other market-specific data. Generally, minimum requirements for equity, debt service coverage ratios (&#8220;DSCRs&#8221;), and level of pre-leasing activity are established based on perceived risk in each subcategory. Loan-to-value (value is defined as the lower of cost or market) limits are set below regulatory prescribed ceilings and generally range between 50 and 80 percent depending on underlying product set. Term and amortization requirements are set based on prudent standards for interim real estate lending. Equity requirements are established based on the quality and liquidity of the primary source of repayment. For example, more equity would be required for a speculative construction project or land loan than for a property fully leased to a credit tenant or a roster of tenants. Typically, a borrower must have at least 15 percent of cost invested in a project before FHN will fund loan dollars. Income properties are required to achieve a DSCR greater than or equal to 125 percent at inception or stabilization of the project based on loan amortization and a minimum underwriting interest rate. Some product types that possess a greater risk profile require a higher level of equity, as well as a higher DSCR threshold. A proprietary minimum underwriting interest rate is used to calculate compliance with underwriting standards. Generally, specific levels of pre-leasing must be met for construction loans on income properties. A global cash flow analysis is performed at the sponsor level. The majority of the portfolio is on a floating rate basis tied to appropriate spreads over LIBOR. 

The credit administration and ongoing monitoring consists of multiple internal control processes. Construction loans are closed and administered by a centralized control unit. Underwriters and credit approval personnel stress the borrower&#8217;s/project&#8217;s financial capacity utilizing numerous attributes such as interest rates, vacancy, and discount rates. Key information is captured from the various portfolios and then stressed at the aggregate level. Results are utilized to assist with the assessment of the adequacy of the ALLL and to steer portfolio management strategies. 

CRE Asset Quality Trends 

T he CRE portfolio had continued stable performance as of December 31, 2019 . The allowance increased $4.8 million from December 31, 2018, to $36.1 million as of December 31, 2019 , driven by organic loan growth. Allowance as a percentage of loans increased 5 basis points from December 31, 2018, to .83 percent as of December 31, 2019 . Nonperforming loans decreased $1.2 million from December 31, 2018, to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total CRE loans decreased 3 basis points from 2018 to .04 percent as of December 31, 2019 . Accruing delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loans decreased to .02 percent as of December 31, 2019 , from .06 percent as of December 31, 2018. FHN recognized net charge-offs of $.7 million in 2019 compared $.4 million in 2018. The following table shows commercial real estate asset quality trends by segment.

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate portfolio was $6.0 billion on December 31, 2019 , and is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of December 31, 2019 , are in Tennessee (54 percent), North Carolina (15 percent), Florida (13 percent), and California (3 percent), with no other state representing more than 3 percent of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 , approximately 83 percent of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. As of December 31, 2019 , the weighted average FICO score at origination of this portfolio was 755 and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 753, compared to 753 and 752, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $.9 billion, or 15 percent, of the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens while $.1 billion, or 2 percent, were second liens whose first liens are owned or serviced by FHN. FHN obtains first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation activities, and places a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performance issues with the first lien loan. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) comprise $1.3 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2019 . FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is automatically frozen if a borrower becomes 45 days or more past due on payments. Once the draw period has concluded, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 76 percent of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period compared to 72 percent as of December 31, 2018. Based on when draw periods are scheduled to end per the line agreement, it is expected that $315.1 million, or 32 percent of HELOCs currently in the draw period, will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months. Generally, delinquencies for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement; however, after some seasoning, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. The home equity lines of the consumer real estate portfolio are monitored closely for those nearing the end of the draw period and borrowers are initially contacted at least 24 months before the repayment period begins to remind the customer of the terms of their agreement and to inform them of options. The following table shows the HELOCs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period.

Underwriting 

For the majority of loans in this portfolio, underwriting decisions are made through a centralized loan underwriting center. To obtain a consumer real estate loan, the loan applicant(s) in most cases must first meet a minimum qualifying FICO score. Minimum FICO score requirements are established by management for both loans secured by real estate as well as non-real estate loans. Management also establishes maximum loan amounts, loan-to-value ratios, and Debt-to-Income (&#8220;DTI&#8221;) ratios for each consumer real estate product. Applicants must have the financial capacity (or available income) to service the debt by not exceeding a calculated DTI ratio. The amount of the loan is limited to a percentage of the lesser of the current value or sales price of the collateral. Identified guideline and policy exceptions require established mitigating factors that have been approved for use by Credit Risk Management. 

HELOC interest rates are variable and adjust with movements in the index rate stated in the loan agreement. Such loans can have elevated risks of default, particularly in a rising interest rate environment, potentially stressing borrower capacity to repay the loan at the higher interest rate. FHN&#8217;s current underwriting practice requires HELOC borrowers to qualify based on a fully indexed, fully amortized payment methodology. FHN&#8217;s underwriting guidelines require borrowers to qualify at an interest rate that is 200 basis points above the note rate. This mitigates risk to FHN in the event of a sharp rise in interest rates over a relatively short time horizon. 

HELOC Portfolio Risk Management 

FHN performs continuous HELOC account review processes in order to identify higher-risk home equity lines and initiate preventative and corrective actions. The reviews consider a number of account activity patterns and characteristics such as the number of times delinquent within recent periods, changes in credit bureau score since origination, score degradation, performance of the first lien, and account utilization. In accordance with FHN&#8217;s interpretation of regulatory guidance, FHN may block future draws on accounts in order to mitigate risk of loss to FHN. 

Consumer Real Estate Asset Quality Trends 

Overall, performance of the consumer real estate portfolio remained strong in 2019 despite deterioration in the non-strategic segment of some metrics compared to prior year. The non-strategic segment is a run-off portfolio and while the absolute dollars of nonaccruals declined compared to December 31, 2018, nonperforming loans ratios deteriorated. That trend of increasing deterioration of ratios in the non-strategic segment is likely to continue and may become more skewed as the portfolio shrinks unevenly, with stronger borrowers exiting the portfolio more rapidly than others. The ALLL decreased $6.8 million from December 31, 2018, to $19.6 million as of December 31, 2019 , with the majority of the decline attributable to the non-strategic segment. The balance of nonperforming loans decreased $11.3 million to $71.3 million on December 31, 2019 . Loans delinquent 30 or more days and still accruing decreased from $46.5 million as of December 31, 2018, to $36.6 million as of December 31, 2019 . The portfolio realized net recoveries of $9.2 million in 2019 compared to net recoveries of $10.3 million in 2018. The following table shows consumer real estate asset quality trends by segment.

Permanent Mortgage 

The permanent mortgage portfolio was $.2 billion on December 31, 2019 . This portfolio is primarily composed of jumbo mortgages and one-time-close (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) completed construction loans in the non-strategic segment that were originated through pre-2009 mortgage businesses. The corporate segment includes loans that were previously included in off-balance sheet proprietary securitization trusts. These loans were brought back into the loan portfolios at fair value through the execution of cleanup calls due to the relatively small balances left in the securitization and should continue to run-off. Approximately 27 percent of loan balances as of December 31, 2019 , are in California, but the remainder of the portfolio is somewhat geographically diverse. Non-strategic and corporate segment run-off primarily contributed to the $52.1 million decrease in permanent mortgage period-end balances from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019 . 

Permanent Mortgage Asset Quality Trends 

The permanent mortgage portfolios within the non-strategic and corporate segments are run-off portfolios. As a result, asset quality metrics are becoming skewed as the portfolios shrink and some of the stronger borrowers payoff or refinance elsewhere. The ALLL decreased $2.2 million as of December 31, 2019 , from $11 million as of December 31, 2018. TDR reserves (which are estimates of losses for the expected life of the loan) comprise 88 percent of the ALLL for the permanent mortgage portfolio as of December 31, 2019 . Consolidated accruing delinquencies decreased $.8 million from December 31, 2018 to $6.3 million as of December 31, 2019 . Nonperforming loans decreased $7.4 million from December 31, 2018, to $14.3 million as of December 31, 2019 . The portfolio experienced net recoveries of $2.8 million in 2019 compared to net recoveries of $.9 million in 2018. The following table shows permanent mortgage asset quality trends by segment.

##TABLE_END

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 79 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The total allowance for loan losses increased to $200.3 million on December 31, 2019 , from $180.4 million on December 31, 2018. The ALLL as of December 31, 2019 , reflects strong asset quality with the consumer real estate portfolio continuing to stabilize, historically low levels of net charge-offs, and declining non-strategic balances. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans, net of unearned income, decreased to .64 percent on December 31, 2019 , from .66 percent on December 31, 2018. 

The provision for loan losses is the charge to (or release of) earnings necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Provision expense was $47.0 million in 2019 compared to $7.0 million in 2018. The increase in provision expense was primarily the result of increased reserves due to commercial loan growth, grade migration, two charge-offs, and a relationship that was downgraded in first quarter 2019. 

FHN expects asset quality trends to remain relatively stable for the near term if the growth of the economy continues. The C&#38;I portfolio is expected to continue to show stable trends but short-term variability (both positive and negative) is possible, primarily due to the size of the credits within this portfolio. The CRE portfolio metrics should be relatively consistent as FHN expects stable property values over the near term; however, oversupply of any CRE product type, changes in the lending environment, or economic uncertainty could result in decreased property values (which could happen abruptly). The remaining non-strategic consumer real estate and permanent mortgage portfolios should continue to steadily wind down. Asset quality metrics within non-strategic are becoming skewed as the portfolios continue to shrink, with stronger credits exiting the portfolios more rapidly than others. Continued stabilization in performance of the consumer real estate portfolio assumes an ongoing positive economic outlook as consumer delinquency and loss rates are correlated with life events that affect borrowers' finances, unemployment trends, and strength of the housing market. 

Effective January 1, 2020, FHN adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," and related ASUs. Refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information about the standard and its impact on FHN. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were $27.1 million in 2019 compared to $16.1 million in 2018. 

The commercial portfolio experienced $27.7 million of net charge-offs in 2019 compared to $11.7 million in 2018. Commercial charge-offs were driven by a $9.2 million partial charge-off on an energy credit and a $7.8 million partial charge-off on a healthcare credit. In addition, the consumer portfolio experienced $.6 million of net recoveries in 2019 compared to $4.4 million of net charge-offs in 2018. The net decrease in consumer portfolio net charge-offs was driven by the credit card and other portfolio.

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 81 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or on a case-by-case basis if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans that FHN continues to receive payments including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy, and second liens, regardless of delinquency status, behind first liens that are 90 or more days past due, are bankruptcies, or are TDRs. These, along with OREO, excluding OREO from government insured mortgages, represent nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;). 

Total nonperforming assets (including NPLs HFS) increased to $181.9 million on December 31, 2019 , from $175.5 million on December 31, 2018. The nonperforming assets ratio (nonperforming assets excluding NPLs HFS to total period-end loans plus OREO and other assets) was .57 percent as of December 31, 2019 , compared to .62 percent as of December 31, 2018. 

The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs in the loan portfolio was 1.24 times as of December 31, 2019 , compared to 1.22 times as of December 31, 2018. Certain nonperforming loans in both the commercial and consumer portfolios are deemed collateral-dependent and are charged down to an estimate of collateral value less costs to sell. Because loss content has been recognized through a partial charge-off, typically reserves are not recorded.

The following table provides an activity rollforward of OREO balances for December 31, 2019 and 2018. The balance of OREO, exclusive of inventory from government insured mortgages, decreased to $15.7 million as of December 31, 2019 , from $22.4 million as of December 31, 2018 , driven by the sale of OREO, primarily those acquired from CBF. Moreover, property values have stabilized which also affects the balance of OREO.

Past Due Loans and Potential Problem Assets 

Past due loans are loans contractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status. Loans in the portfolio that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing were $21.9 million on December 31, 2019 , compared to $32.5 million on December 31, 2018. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased to $36.1 million on December 31, 2019 , from $42.7 million on December 31, 2018. 

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the Federal banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan portfolio were $346.9 million on December 31, 2019 , compared to $317.0 million on December 31, 2018. The increase year-over-year in potential problem assets was due to a net increase in classified commercial loans within the C&#38;I portfolio. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

Troubled Debt Restructuring and Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. In a situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty, FHN identifies and reports that loan as a Troubled Debt Restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). See Note 4 &#8211; Loans for further discussion regarding TDRs and loan modifications. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 85 

Commercial Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s credit risk management governance processes, the Loan Rehab and Recovery Department (&#8220;LRRD&#8221;) is responsible for managing most commercial relationships with borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are being considered for impairment, classified as substandard or worse, placed on nonaccrual status, foreclosed or in process of foreclosure, or in active or contemplated litigation. LRRD has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout and/or rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate and/or minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets. While every circumstance is different, LRRD will generally use forbearance agreements (generally 6-12 months) as an element of commercial loan workouts, which might include reduced interest rates, reduced payments, release of guarantor, or entering into short sale agreements. 

The individual impairment assessments completed on commercial loans in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic related to Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;ASC 310-40&#8221;) include loans classified as TDRs as well as loans that may have been modified yet not classified as TDRs by management. For example, a modification of loan terms that management would generally not consider to be a TDR could be a temporary extension of maturity to allow a borrower to complete an asset sale whereby the proceeds of such transaction are to be paid to satisfy the outstanding debt. Additionally, a modification that extends the term of a loan but does not involve reduction of principal or accrued interest, in which the interest rate is adjusted to reflect current market rates for similarly situated borrowers, is not considered a TDR. Nevertheless, each assessment will take into account any modified terms and will be comprehensive to ensure appropriate impairment assessment. If individual impairment is identified, management will either hold specific reserves on the amount of impairment, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, write down the carrying amount of the asset to the net realizable value of the collateral. 

Consumer Loan Modifications 

FHN does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the U.S. government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former Home Affordable Modification Program (&#8220;HAMP&#8221;). Generally, a majority of loans modified under any such proprietary programs are classified as TDRs. 

Within the HELOC and R/E installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment, TDRs are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 1 percent for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification; for certain modifications, the modified interest rate increases 2 percent per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved. Permanent mortgage TDRs are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 2 percent for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate steps up 1 percent every year until it reaches the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Weekly Survey Rate cap. Contractual maturities may be extended to 40 years on permanent mortgages and to 30 years for consumer real estate loans. Within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment, TDRs are typically modified through either a short-term credit card hardship program or a longer-term credit card workout program. In the credit card hardship program, borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for 6 months to 1 year. In the credit card workout program, customers are granted a rate reduction to 0 percent and term extensions for up to 5 years to pay off the remaining balance. 

Following classification as a TDR, modified loans within the consumer portfolio, which were previously evaluated for impairment on a collective basis determined by their smaller balances and homogenous nature, become subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 310-10-35, which requires individual evaluation of the debt for impairment. However, as applicable accounting guidance allows, FHN may aggregate certain smaller-balance homogeneous TDRs and use historical statistics, such as aggregated charge-off amounts and average amounts recovered, along with a composite effective interest rate to measure impairment when such impaired loans have risk characteristics in common. 

On December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, FHN had $206.3 million and $228.2 million portfolio loans classified as TDRs, respectively. For TDRs in the loan portfolio, FHN had loan loss reserves of $19.7 million and $27.7 million, or 10 and 12 percent of TDR balances, as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Additionally, FHN had $51.1 million and $57.8 million of HFS loans classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Total held-to-maturity TDRs decreased by $21.9 million with the decline attributable to consumer real estate and permanent mortgage partially offset by an increase in commercial.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

FHN derives revenue from providing services and, in many cases, assuming and managing risk for profit which exposes the Company to business strategy and reputational, interest rate, liquidity, market, capital adequacy, operational, compliance, and credit risks that require ongoing oversight and management. FHN has an enterprise-wide approach to risk governance, measurement, management, and reporting including an economic capital allocation process that is tied to risk profiles used to measure risk-adjusted returns. Through an enterprise-wide risk governance structure and a statement of risk tolerance approved by the Board, management continually evaluates the balance of risk/return and earnings volatility with shareholder value. 

FHN&#8217;s enterprise-wide risk governance structure begins with the Board. The Board, working with the Executive &#38; Risk Committee of the Board, establishes the Company&#8217;s risk tolerance by approving policies and limits that provide standards for the nature and the level of risk the Company is willing to assume. The Board regularly receives reports on management&#8217;s performance against the Company&#8217;s risk tolerance primarily through the Board&#8217;s Executive &#38; Risk and Audit Committees. 

To further support the risk governance provided by the Board, FHN has established accountabilities, control processes, procedures, and a management governance structure designed to align risk management with risk-taking throughout the Company. The control procedures are aligned with FHN&#8217;s four components of risk governance: (1) Specific Risk Committees; (2) the Risk Management Organization; (3) Business Unit Risk Management; and (4) Independent Assurance Functions. 

##TABLE_START 1. 

Specific Risk Committees: The Board has delegated authority to the Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) to manage Business Strategy and Reputation Risk, and the general business affairs of the Company under the Board&#8217;s oversight. The CEO utilizes the executive management team and the Executive Risk Management Committee to carry out these duties and to analyze existing and emerging strategic and reputation risks and determines the appropriate course of action. The Executive Risk Management Committee is comprised of the CEO and certain officers designated by the CEO. The Executive Risk Management Committee is supported by a set of specific risk committees focused on unique risk types (e.g. liquidity, credit, operational, etc). These risk committees provide a mechanism that assembles the necessary expertise and perspectives of the management team to discuss emerging risk issues, monitor the Company&#8217;s risk-taking activities, and evaluate specific transactions and exposures. These committees also monitor the direction and trend of risks relative to business strategies and market conditions and direct management to respond to risk issues. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START 2. 

The Risk Management Organization: The Company&#8217;s risk management organization, led by the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, provides objective oversight of risk-taking activities. The risk management organization translates FHN&#8217;s overall risk tolerance into approved limits and formal policies and is supported by corporate staff functions, including the Corporate Secretary, Legal, Finance, Human Resources, and Technology. Risk management also works with business units and functional experts to establish appropriate operating standards and monitor business practices in relation to those standards. Additionally, risk management proactively works with business units and senior management to focus management on key risks in the Company and emerging trends that may change FHN&#8217;s risk profile. The Chief Risk Officer has overall responsibility and accountability for enterprise risk management and aggregate risk reporting. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START 3. 

Business Unit Risk Management: The Company&#8217;s business units are responsible for identifying, acknowledging, quantifying, mitigating, and managing all risks arising within their respective units. They determine and execute their business strategies, which puts them closest to the changing nature of risks and they are best able to take the needed actions to manage and mitigate those risks. The business units are supported by the risk management organization that helps identify and consider risks when making business decisions. Management processes, structure, and policies are designed to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations as well as provide organizational clarity for authority, decision-making, and accountability. The risk governance structure supports and promotes the escalation of material items to executive management and the Board. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START 4. 

Independent Assurance Functions: Internal Audit, Credit Assurance Services (&#8220;CAS&#8221;), and Model Validation provide an independent and objective assessment of the design and execution of the Company&#8217;s internal control system, including management processes, risk governance, and policies and procedures. These groups&#8217; activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that risks are appropriately identified and communicated; resources are safeguarded; significant financial, managerial, and operating information is complete, accurate, and reliable; and employee actions are in compliance with the Company&#8217;s policies and applicable laws and regulations. Internal Audit and CAS report to the Chief Audit Executive, who is appointed by and reports to the Audit Committee of the 

##TABLE_END

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 88 

Board. Internal Audit reports quarterly to the Audit Committee of the Board, while CAS reports quarterly to the Executive &#38; Risk Committee of the Board. Model Validation reports to the Chief Risk Officer and reports annually to the Audit Committee of the Board. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact FHN&#8217;s earnings. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with FHN&#8217;s operations, primarily trading activities within FHN&#8217;s fixed income segment, but also through non-trading activities which are primarily affected by interest rate risk that is managed by the Asset Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) within FHN. 

FHN is exposed to market risk related to the trading securities inventory and loans held-for-sale maintained by its Fixed Income division in connection with its fixed income distribution activities. Various types of securities inventory positions are procured for distribution to customers by the sales staff. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts. Refer to the "Determination of Fair Value - Trading securities and trading liabilities" section of Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities, which section is incorporated into this MD&#38;A by this reference. 

FHN&#8217;s market risk appetite is approved by the Executive &#38; Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and executed through management policies and procedures of ALCO and the FHN Financial Risk Committee. These policies contain various market risk limits including, for example, overall balance sheet size limits for Fixed Income, VaR limits for the trading securities inventory, and individual position limits and sector limits for products with credit risk, among others. Risk measures are computed and reviewed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with market risk management policies. 

VaR and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99 percent confidence level and 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR ("SVaR") measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 89 

A summary of FHN's VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is as follows:

##TABLE_END

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN&#8217;s Fixed Income division procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to customers, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, Fixed Income traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHN&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for Fixed Income to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its VaR measurements. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the "Capital" section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within Fixed Income have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement in interest rates. ALCO is responsible for overseeing the management of existing and emerging interest rate risk in the company within risk tolerances established by the Board. FHN primarily manages interest rate risk by structuring the balance sheet to maintain a desired level of associated earnings and to protect the economic value of FHN&#8217;s capital. 

&#160; 

Net interest income and the value of equity are affected by changes in the level of market interest rates because of the differing repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, the exercise of prepayment options held by loan customers, the early withdrawal options held by deposit customers, and changes in the basis between and changing shapes of the various yield curves used to price assets and liabilities. To isolate the repricing, basis, option, and yield curve components of overall interest rate risk, FHN employs Gap, Earnings at Risk, and Economic Value of Equity analyses generated by a balance sheet simulation model. 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this MD&#38;A. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 , NII exposures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and 200 basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of .5 percent, .8 percent, 2.1 percent, and 3.5 percent, respectively compared to base NII. A steepening yield curve scenario where long-term 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 90 

rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance of .7 percent. A flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 1.1 percent. Rate shocks of minus 25 basis points and 50 basis points result in unfavorable NII variances of 1.0 percent and 2.7 percent. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

During the past few years, the movement of short term interest rates higher after a prolonged period of very low interest rates has had an overall positive effect on FHN's NII and NIM. More recently, the Federal Reserve has lowered short term interest rates. However, competitive pressures have caused FHN&#8217;s deposit costs to fall slower than the long term &#8220;through the cycle&#8221; assumptions made in its simulation model. Of the many assumptions made in its simulation model, deposit pricing and deposit mix are two that can have a meaningful impact on measured results. For example, in the analysis presented above, interest bearing deposit rates are assumed to decrease by 25 basis points in the -50 basis point scenario. If interest bearing deposit costs were to decline 5 percent less than currently assumed in the -50 basis point scenario, the 2.7 percent unfavorable variance in NII disclosed above for that scenario would deteriorate to a 2.9 percent unfavorable variance. 

Fair Value Shock Analysis 

Interest rate risk and the slope of the yield curve also affect the fair value of Fixed Income&#8217;s trading inventory that is reflected in Fixed Income&#8217;s noninterest income. 

Generally, low or declining interest rates with a positively sloped yield curve tend to increase Fixed Income&#8217;s income through higher demand for fixed income products. Additionally, the fair value of Fixed Income&#8217;s trading inventory can fluctuate as a result of differences between current interest rates and the interest rates of fixed income securities in the trading inventory. 

Derivatives 

In the normal course of business, FHN utilizes various financial instruments (including derivative contracts and credit-related agreements) to manage the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments generally caused by changes in interest rates including Fixed Income&#8217;s securities inventory, certain term borrowings, and certain loans. Additionally, Fixed Income or Regional Banking may enter into derivative contracts in order to meet customers' needs. However, such derivative contracts are typically offset with a derivative contract entered into with an upstream counterparty in order to mitigate risk associated with changes in interest rates. 

The simulation models and related hedging strategies discussed above exclude the dynamics related to how fee income and noninterest expense may be affected by actual changes in interest rates or expectations of changes. See Note 22 - Derivatives for additional discussion of these instruments. 

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ADEQUACY 

The capital management objectives of FHN are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to well-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. The Capital Management Committee, chaired by the Senior Vice President and Corporate Treasurer, reports to ALCO and is responsible for capital management oversight and provides a forum for addressing management issues related to capital adequacy. This committee reviews sources and uses of capital, key capital ratios, segment economic capital allocation methodologies, and other factors in monitoring and managing current capital levels, as well as potential future sources and uses of capital. The Capital Management Committee also recommends capital management policies, which are submitted for approval to ALCO and the Executive &#38; Risk Committee and the Board as necessary. 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events including data or network security breaches of FHN or of third parties affecting FHN or its customers. This risk is inherent in all businesses. Operational risk is divided into the following risk areas, which have been established at the corporate level to address these risks across the entire organization:

Management, measurement, and reporting of operational risk are overseen by the Operational Risk, Fiduciary, Financial Governance, FHN Financial Risk, and Investment Rationalization Board Committees. Key representatives from the business segments, operating units, and supporting units are represented on these committees as appropriate. These governance committees manage the individual operational risk types across the Company by setting standards, monitoring activity, initiating actions, and reporting exposures and results. Key Committee activities and decisions are reported to the appropriate governance committee or included in the Enterprise Risk Report, a quarterly analysis of risk within the organization that is provided to the Executive and Risk Committee. Emphasis is dedicated to refinement of processes and tools to aid in measuring and managing material operational risks and providing for a culture of awareness and accountability. 

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct applicable to FHN&#8217;s activities. Management, measurement, and reporting of compliance risk are overseen by the Operational Risk Committee. Key executives from the business segments, legal, risk management, and service functions are represented on the Committee. Summary reports of Committee activities and decisions are provided to the appropriate governance committees. Reports include the status of regulatory activities, internal compliance program initiatives, and evaluation of emerging compliance risk areas. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower&#8217;s or counterparty&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms. FHN is subject to credit risk in lending, trading, investing, liquidity/funding, and asset management activities although lending activities have the most exposure to credit risk. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the types of transactions, the structure of those transactions, collateral received, the use of guarantors and the parties involved. 

FHN assesses and manages credit risk through a series of policies, processes, measurement systems, and controls. The Credit Risk Management Committee (&#8220;CRMC&#8221;) is responsible for overseeing the management of existing and emerging credit risks in the company within the broad risk tolerances established by the Board. The CRMC reports through the Executive Risk Management Committee. The Credit Risk Management function, led by the Chief Credit Officer, provides strategic and tactical credit leadership by maintaining policies, overseeing credit approval, assessing new credit products, strategies and processes, and managing portfolio composition and performance. 

While the Credit Risk function oversees FHN&#8217;s credit risk management, there is significant coordination between the business lines and the Credit Risk function in order to manage FHN&#8217;s credit risk and maintain strong asset quality. The Credit Risk function recommends portfolio, industry/sector, and individual customer limits to the Executive &#38; Risk Committee of the Board for approval. Adherence to these approved limits is vigorously monitored by Credit Risk which provides recommendations to slow or cease lending to the business lines as commitments near established lending limits. Credit Risk also ensures subject matter experts are providing oversight, support and credit approvals, particularly in the specialty lending areas where industry-specific knowledge is required. Management emphasizes general portfolio servicing such that emerging risks are able to be spotted early enough to correct potential deficiencies, prevent further credit deterioration, and mitigate credit losses. 

The Credit Risk Management function assesses the asset quality trends and results, as well as lending processes, adherence to underwriting guidelines (portfolio-specific underwriting guidelines are discussed further in the Asset Quality Trends section), and utilizes this information to inform management regarding the current state of credit quality and as a factor of the estimation process for determining the allowance for loan losses. The CRMC reviews on a periodic basis various reports issued by assurance functions which provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of loan servicing, grading accuracy, and other key functions. Additionally, CRMC is presented with and discusses various portfolios, lending activity and lending-related projects. 

All of the above activities are subject to independent review by FHN&#8217;s Credit Assurance Services Group. CAS reports to the Chief Audit Executive, who is appointed by and reports to the Audit Committee of the Board, and provides quarterly reports to the Executive &#38; Risk Committee of the Board. CAS is charged with providing the Executive &#38; Risk Committee of the Board and executive management with independent, objective, and timely assessments of FHN&#8217;s portfolio quality, credit policies, and credit risk management processes. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

ALCO also focuses on liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy. The objective of the Liquidity Policy is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed, should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry as a whole, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal Funds markets, incremental borrowing cap acity at the F HLB ($3.4 billion was available at December 31, 2019 ), brokered deposits, loan sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Banks. 

Core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks. Generally, core deposits represent funding from a financial institution's customer base which provide inexpensive, predictable pricing. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures these deposits to the extent authorized by law. Generally, these limits are $250 thousand per account owner for interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts. The ratio of total loans, excluding loans HFS and restricted real estate loans, to core deposits was 98 percent on December 31, 2019 compared to 100 percent on December 31, 2018. 

FHN also may use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Currently, the largest concentration of unsecured borrowings is federal funds purchased from correspondent bank customers. These funds are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings is securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with Regional Banking&#8217;s business customers or Fixed Income&#8217;s broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank may access the debt markets in order to provide funding through the issuance of senior or subordinated unsecured debt subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In 2014, First Horizon Bank issued $400 million of fixed rate senior notes due in December 2019. In October 2015, FHN issued $500 million of fixed rate senior notes due in December 2020. First Horizon Bank early redeemed the $400 million senior debt on November 1, 2019. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing preferred equity, and (for FHN) by issuing common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In January 2013, FHN issued $100 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. As of December 31, 2019 , First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295.4 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. The amount paid to the parent company through First Horizon Bank common dividends is managed as part of FHN&#8217;s overall cash management process, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of First Horizon Bank to transfer funds to FHN in the form of cash, common dividends, loans, or advances. At any given time, the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow First Horizon Bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year to date. For any period, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 92 

&#8216;retained net income&#8217; generally is equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by First Horizon Bank. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $331.2 million as of January 1, 2020. Consequently, on that date the Bank could pay common dividends up to that amount to its sole common stockholder, FHN, or to its preferred shareholders without prior regulatory approval. First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $345.0 million in 2019 and $420.0 million in 2018. In January 2020, First Horizon Bank declared and paid a common dividend to the parent company in the amount of $65 million. During 2019 and 2018, First Horizon Bank declared and paid dividends on its preferred stock quarterly. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in first quarter 2020 payable in April 2020. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions, and also availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Beginning January 1, 2019, FHN and First Horizon Bank each must maintain a capital conservation buffer or else face dividend restrictions. The buffer is an extra one-half percent above well-capitalized levels (equal to an extra 2.5 percent above minimum levels) for each of three capital ratios: Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital. The restrictions would apply to FHN or First Horizon Bank if the buffer is not met for any of those ratios. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. FHN paid a cash dividend of $.14 per common share on January 2, 2020, and in January 2020 the Board approved a $.15 per common share cash dividend payable on April 1, 2020, to shareholders of record on March 13, 2020. FHN paid a cash dividend of $1,550.00 per preferred share on January 10, 2020, and in January 2020 the Board approved a $1,550.00 per preferred share cash dividend payable on April 10, 2020, to shareholders of record on March 26, 2020. 

CREDIT RATINGS 

FHN is currently able to fund a majority of the balance sheet through core deposits, which are generally not as sensitive to FHN&#8217;s credit ratings as other types of funding. However, maintaining adequate credit ratings on debt issues and preferred stock is critical to liquidity should FHN need to access funding from other sources, including from long-term debt issuances and certain brokered deposits, at an attractive rate. The availability and cost of funds other than core deposits is also dependent upon marketplace perceptions of the financial soundness of FHN, which include such factors as capital levels, asset quality, and reputation. The availability of core deposit funding is stabilized by federal deposit insurance, which can be removed only in extraordinary circumstances, but may also be influenced to some extent by the same factors that affect other funding sources. FHN&#8217;s credit ratings are also referenced in various respects in agreements with certain derivative counterparties as discussed in Note 22 - Derivatives.

CASH FLOWS 

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows provide information on cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. The level of cash and cash equivalents decreased $138.4 million during 2019 compared to a decrease of $46.7 million during 2018 and an increase of $414.3 million in 2017. 

Net cash used by investing activities was $2.4 billion in 2019, largely driven by an increase in loan balances somewhat offset by a decrease in interest-bearing cash and a net decrease in AFS debt securities, as maturities and sales outpaced purchases. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 billion in 2019, primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings somewhat offset by a decrease in term borrowings, deposits, share repurchases and cash dividends paid during 2019. The increase in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of an increase in FHLB borrowings, which fluctuate largely based on loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. The decrease in term borrowing was primarily the result of FHN's redemption of $400 million of senior debt during fourth quarter 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities was $830.3 million in 2019 due in large part to net cash inflows of $1.4 billion related to a decrease in fixed income trading securities and favorably driven cash-related net income items. Cash outflows of $1.3 billion related to loans HFS negatively impacted operating cash flows during 2019 as purchases of government guaranteed loans outpaced sales, including the sale of approximately $25 million UPB of subprime consumer loans in 2019. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $761.4 million in 2018, driven by a decrease in short-term borrowings and to a lesser extent cash dividends paid and share repurchases, somewhat offset by an increase in deposits. The decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of a decline in FHLB borrowings. The increase in deposits was due in large part to increases in savings and time deposits as a result of FHN's strategic focus on growing deposits. Net cash provided by investing activities was $480.4 million in 2018, driven by proceeds from the sales of FHN's remaining Visa Class B shares and net decreases in the AFS and loan portfolios. Proceeds from the sales and payoffs of TRUPS loans and OREO during 2018 also favorably impacted cash flows in 2018. A decrease in interest-bearing cash, cash paid associated with the cancellation of common shares in connection with CBF dissenting shareholders, and cash paid related to the divestiture of two branches negatively impacted investing cash flows during 2018. Net cash provided by operating cash flows was $234.3 million in 2018. A $1.0 billion net decrease in fixed income trading activities and favorably driven cash-related net income items positively impacted operating cash flows in 2018, but were somewhat offset by cash outflows of $1.4 billion related to a net increase in 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 94 

loans HFS, as purchases of government guaranteed loans outpaced sales, including the sale of approximately $120 million of subprime auto loans. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 billion in 2017, largely driven by cash inflows of $2.1 billion related to an increase in short-term borrowings, primarily FHLB borrowings used to fund loan growth; however these were somewhat offset by a decrease in deposit balances and cash dividends . Net cash used by investing activities was $1.3 billion in 2017 primarily driven by increases in loan balances and interest-bearing cash of $808.4 million and $ 121.4 million, respectively, as well as $336.6 million of net cash payments associated with the CBF and Coastal acquisitions. Net cash used by operating activities was $28.8 million in 2017 as operating cash flows were negatively impacted by a net increase in loans HFS within the fixed income segment as well as cash outflows of $384.2 million related to fixed income activities, but were favorably impacted by cash-related net income items and a $223.8 million net decrease in operating assets and liabilities. 

REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

Obligations from Pre-2009 Mortgage Businesses 

Prior to September 2008 FHN originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. Sales typically were effected either as non-recourse whole loan sales or through non-recourse proprietary securitizations. Conventional conforming single-family residential mortgage loans were sold predominately to two government-sponsored entities, or "GSEs": Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Also, federally insured or guaranteed whole loans were pooled, and payments to investors were guaranteed through Ginnie Mae. Many mortgage loan originations, especially nonconforming mortgage loans, were sold to investors, or certificate-holders, predominantly through First Horizon proprietary securitizations but also, to a lesser extent, through other whole loans sold to private non-Agency purchasers. FHN used only one trustee for all of its First Horizon proprietary securitizations. In addition to First Horizon proprietary securitization and other whole loan sales activities, FHN also originated and sometimes sold or securitized second-lien, line of credit, and government-insured mortgage loans. 

From these pre-2009 activities, FHN has incurred substantial losses stemming from obligations to repurchase loans, pay make-whole amounts, or otherwise resolve claims that loans which FHN originated, or FHN's servicing of those loans, were deficient in a manner for which FHN was liable. Many years ago, FHN established a repurchase and foreclosure liability, or reserve, in connection with those claims. FHN has settled many claims, and the reserve is reduced each time a claim is settled. As discussed in Note 17 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

Servicing Obligations 

FHN's national servicing business was sold as part of the platform sale in 2008. A significant amount of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") was sold at that time, and a significant amount was retained. The related servicing activities, including foreclosure and loss mitigation practices, not sold in 2008 were outsourced including a subservicing arrangement initiated in 2011 (the "2011 subservicer"). In fourth quarter 2013 and first quarter 2014, FHN sold and transferred a substantial majority of its remaining servicing obligations and servicing assets (including advances) to the 2011 subservicer. The servicing still retained by FHN is not significant and continues to be subserviced. 

As servicer, FHN had contractual obligations to the owners of the loans (primarily GSEs) and securitization trustees to handle billing, custodial, and other tasks related to each loan. Each subservicer undertook to perform those obligations on FHN's behalf during the applicable subservicing period, although FHN legally remained the servicer of record for those loans that were subserviced. 

As mentioned in Note 17 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures - FHN has received a notice of indemnification claims from its 2011 subservicer, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, currently doing business as "Mr. Cooper." The notice asserts several categories of indemnity obligations by FHN to Nationstar in connection with mortgage loans under the subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction. This matter currently is not in formal litigation, but litigation in the future is possible. 

Repurchase Accrual Methodology 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

The repurchase and foreclosure liability is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 95 

liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The repurchase and foreclosure liability decreased to $14.5 million on December 31, 2019 from $32.3 million on December 31, 2018, primarily driven by a $12.6 million payment related to a complete settlement with a single party during second quarter 2019. 

Other Contractual Obligations 

Pension obligations are funded by FHN to provide current and future benefits to participants in FHN&#8217;s noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan. On December 31, 2019, the annual measurement date, pension obligations (representing the present value of estimated future benefit payments), including obligations of the unfunded plans, were $835.9 million with $826.1 million of assets (measured at current fair value) in the qualified plan&#8217;s trust to fund the qualified plan&#8217;s obligations. The discount rate for 2019 of 3.31 percent for the qualified pension plan and 3.08 percent for the nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan was determined by using a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to thirty years. The discount rates for the pension and nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans are selected based on data specific to FHN&#8217;s plans and participant populations. See Note 18 - Pension, Savings, and Other Employee Benefits for additional information. As of December 31, 2019, the plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified pension plan. Decisions to contribute to the plan are based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. FHN made no contributions to 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 96 

the qualified pension plan in 2019 and 2017, and made an insignificant contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2018. Management does not currently anticipate that FHN will make a contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2020. 

The nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, excluding the retiree medical plan, are unfunded. Benefit payments under the non-qualified plans were $5.2 million in 2019. FHN anticipates 2020 benefit payments to be $5.2 million. 

FHN has various other financial obligations which may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth contractual obligations representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2019. Purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on FHN and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, FHN enters into commitments to extend credit to borrowers, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. These commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon and are not included in the table.

MARKET UNCERTAINTIES AND PROSPECTIVE TRENDS 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives, changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, political uncertainty, and potential changes in federal policies including changes to the government's approach to tariffs and the potential impact to our customers. In addition, pre-2009 mortgage business matters in the Non-strategic segment could continue to impact FHN&#8217;s quarterly results in ways which are both difficult to predict and unrelated to current operations. 

FHN has prioritized expense discipline to include reducing or controlling certain expenses including realization of expense efficiencies from the merger with CBF and investing in revenue-producing activities, customer-facing technology, and critical infrastructure. FHN remains committed to organic growth through customer retention, key hires, targeted incentives, and other traditional means. 

Performance by FHN, and the entire U.S. financial services industry, is affected considerably by the overall health of the U.S. and global economy and outlook. Furthermore, FHN may be indirectly impacted by global events that impact our customers and their businesses. The most recent recession ended in 2009. During the U.S. economic expansion since 2009, growth was muted compared to earlier recoveries. In the past several years, growth has been more robust and more volatile, impacted (up or down) by several significant events such as U.S. tax and regulatory reform, protracted U.S. tariffs and trade negotiations with major foreign trading partners, and, in 2019, an abrupt change in U.S. interest rate policy. Because few expansions last longer than ten years, it is uncertain how much longer the current expansion will continue even though, currently, indications of impending weakness are modest and mixed. 

In 2018, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by .25 percent four times following similar, but less frequent, raises starting in 2015. These actions, along with a decline in long-term interest rates, flattened the yield curve. Early in 2019, the Federal Reserve signaled the possibility of pausing further increases in short-term interest rates while economic trends were evaluated. The Federal Reserve implemented .25 percent cuts to short-term interest rates three times during 2019. This volatility in 2019 contributed to improved performance in mortgage warehouse lending in the Regional Banking segment and FHN's Fixed Income segment. In 2020, lowered rates will put downward pressure on FHN's net interest margin, and 2019's volatility may abate. However, current expectations that rates are stable, at current (relatively low) levels, appear to have benefited the economy by, at a minimum, removing 2018's threat of rising rate. 

In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, LIBOR as currently operated may not continue after 2021. FHN is not currently able to predict the impact that the transition from LIBOR will have on the Company; however, because FHN has instruments with floating rate terms based on LIBOR, FHN may experience increases in interest, dividends, and other costs relative to these instruments subsequent to 2021. Additionally, the transition from LIBOR could impact or change FHN&#8217;s hedge accounting practices. FHN has initiated efforts to 1) develop an inventory of affected loans, securities, and derivatives, 2) evaluate and draft modifications as needed to address loans outstanding at the time of LIBOR retirement, 3) obtain an understanding of the potential effects for applicable securities and derivatives and 4) assess revisions to product pricing structures based on alternative reference rates. Both the FASB and IRS have released proposals that are intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from LIBOR to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting for those contracts. Each proposal contains specific guidance that must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and FHN is considering this guidance in its transition plans. 

Lastly, while FHN has resolved most matters from the pre-2009 mortgage business, some remain unresolved. The timing or financial impact of resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with accuracy. Accordingly, the non-strategic segment is expected to occasionally and unexpectedly impact FHN&#8217;s overall quarterly results negatively or positively with reserve accruals or releases. Also, although new pre-2009 mortgage business matters of significance arise at a much slower pace than in years past and some formerly common legal claims no longer can be made due to the passage of time, potential for new pre-2009 mortgage business matters remains. 

Foreclosure Practices 

FHN retains exposure for potential deficiencies in servicing related to its pre-2009 mortgage servicing business and subservicing arrangements. Further details regarding these matters are provided in "Obligations from Pre-2009 Mortgage Businesses - Servicing Obligations" under "Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations."

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the loan portfolio. Accounting standards require that loan losses be recorded when management 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 99 

determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the ALLL is a &#8220;critical accounting estimate&#8221; as: (1) changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan losses and net income, (2) it requires management to predict borrowers&#8217; likelihood or capacity to repay, often under uncertain economic conditions, and (3) it requires management to distinguish between losses incurred as of a balance sheet date and losses expected to be incurred in the future. Accordingly, this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is often difficult to determine when specific loss events may actually occur. The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased by charged-off loans. Principal loan amounts are charged off against the ALLL in the period in which the loan or any portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible. This critical accounting estimate applies to the regional banking, non-strategic, and corporate segments. A management committee comprised of representatives from Risk Management, Finance, Credit, and Treasury performs a quarterly review of the assumptions used in FHN&#8217;s ALLL analytical models, makes qualitative assessments of the loan portfolio, and determines if qualitative adjustments should be recommended to the modeled results. On a quarterly basis, as a part of Enterprise Risk reporting and discussion, management addresses credit reserve adequacy and credit losses with the Executive and Risk Committee of FHN&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

FHN believes that the critical assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include: (1) the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers; (2) borrower specific information made available to FHN is current and accurate; (3) the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly; (4) known significant loss events that have occurred were considered by management at the time of assessing the adequacy of the ALLL; (5) the adjustments for economic conditions utilized in the allowance for loan losses estimate represent actual incurred losses; (6) the period of history used for historical loss factors are most reflective of the current environment; (7) the estimate of the time it takes for a loss event to occur and loss to be recognized (the loss emergence period) is most reflective of the current environment; and (8) the reserve rates, as well as other adjustments estimated by management for current events, trends, and conditions, utilized in the process reflect an estimate of losses that have been incurred as of the date of the financial statements. 

While management uses the best information available to establish the ALLL, future adjustments to the ALLL and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates. 

See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Allowance for Loan Losses for detail regarding FHN&#8217;s processes, models, and methodology for determining the ALLL. 

INCOME TAXES 

FHN is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and the states and jurisdictions in which it operates. FHN accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. FHN income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management&#8217;s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. 

Income tax expense consists of both current and deferred taxes. Current income tax expense is an estimate of taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. A DTA or a DTL is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes can be affected by changes in tax rates applicable to future years, either as a result of statutory changes or business changes that may change the jurisdictions in which taxes are paid. Additionally, DTAs are subject to a &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test to determine whether the full amount of the DTAs should be realized in the financial statements. FHN evaluates the likelihood of realization of the DTA based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time, including (as appropriate) scheduled reversals of DTLs, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards attributable to or generated with respect to the DTA. In projecting future taxable income, FHN incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. If the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test is not met, a valuation allowance must be established against the DTA. 

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which FHN operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, FHN must make 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 100 

judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions. FHN attempts to resolve disputes that may arise during the tax examination and audit process. However, certain disputes may ultimately be resolved through the federal and state court systems. 

FHN monitors relevant tax authorities and revises estimates of accrued income taxes on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates may occur due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. Revisions of estimates may also result from income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in estimates may be material to operating results for any given period. 

See also Note 15 - Income Taxes for additional information. 

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

A liability is contingent if the amount or outcome is not presently known, but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event. FHN estimates its contingent liabilities based on management&#8217;s estimates about the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure. Accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event. As part of the estimation process, management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain. 

The assessment of contingent liabilities, including legal contingencies, involves the use of critical estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Management&#8217;s estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures. However, there can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or decisions of arbitrators, will not differ from management&#8217;s assessments. Whenever practicable, management consults with third-party experts (e.g., attorneys, accountants, claims administrators, etc.) to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities. Based on internally and/or externally prepared evaluations, management makes a determination whether the potential exposure requires accrual in the financial statements. 

See Note 17 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures for additional information.

##TABLE_END

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to agree with current presentation. 

Yields and corresponding income amounts are adjusted to a FTE basis assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21 percent in 2019 and 2018 and 35 percent in 2017, and, where applicable, state income taxes. 

Earning asset yields are expressed net of unearned income. Rates are expressed net of unamortized debenture cost for long-term debt. Net interest margin is computed using total net interest income.
