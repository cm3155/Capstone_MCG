REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management at First Horizon National Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. First Horizon National Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Even effective internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations such as the possibility of human error or of circumvention or overriding of controls, and consideration of cost in relation to benefit of a control. Moreover, effectiveness must necessarily be considered according to the existing state of the art of internal control. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may diminish over time. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of First Horizon National Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. This assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that First Horizon National Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. 

First Horizon National Corporation&#8217;s independent auditors have issued an attestation report on First Horizon National Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on the following page.

First Horizon National Corporation: 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited First Horizon National Corporation and subsidiaries&#8217; (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of condition of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

First Horizon National Corporation: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of First Horizon National Corporation and subsidiaries&#8217; (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Assessment of the allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment (Collective ALLL) was $172,426 thousand of the total allowance for loan losses of $200,307 thousand at December 31, 2019. The Company estimated the Collective ALLL using historical net loss factors by grade level, loan product, and business segment for commercial loans; and segmented roll-rate models that incorporate various factors that include historical delinquency trends, experienced loss frequencies, and experienced loss severities for consumer loans. The Company subjected the historical net loss factors to qualitative adjustments to reflect current events, trends, and conditions (including economic considerations and trends), which are not fully captured in the historical net loss factors. 

We identified the assessment of the Collective ALLL as a critical audit matter because there is a high degree of subjectivity in performing procedures over key factors and assumptions used in the Collective ALLL methodology which included (1) the average amount of time it takes for a loss to be confirmed after a loss event has occurred (loss emergence period), (2) the historical data period used to estimate loss rates, and (3) the internal commercial loan grades. The loss emergence period, 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 117 

historical data period used to estimate loss rates, and internal commercial loan grades were challenging to test as the Collective ALLL is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. The assessment of internal commercial loan grades required the use of significant judgment as well as industry knowledge and experience. There was a high level of subjectivity in performing test procedures related to internal and external factors used to estimate the qualitative adjustments. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's Collective ALLL process, including controls to (1) develop and approve the Collective ALLL methodology, (2) determine the key factors and assumptions, (3) develop the qualitative factors, and (4) evaluate the estimate in total. We involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:

performing a methodology assessment and to evaluate that the Company&#8217;s methodology is sufficiently structured, transparent, and repeatable to produce a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles compliant estimate; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

evaluating the key factors and assumptions, specifically the loss emergence period, historical data period used to estimate loss rates, and internal and external factors; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

performing credit file evaluations on a selection of loans to assess the commercial loan grades; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

evaluating the methodology and metrics used by the Company to assess internal and external factors related to qualitative adjustments; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

performing sensitivity analyses over the effect of internal and external factors to assess their impact on the qualitative component of the Collective ALLL. 

##TABLE_END 

We evaluated the cumulative results of the procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the Collective ALLL. 

We have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Accounting. The consolidated financial statements of First Horizon National Corporation (&#8220;FHN&#8221;), including its subsidiaries, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and could differ from actual results. 

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FHN and other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Variable Interest Entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) for which FHN or a subsidiary has been determined to be the primary beneficiary are also consolidated. Affiliates for which FHN is not considered the primary beneficiary and in which FHN does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by the equity method. These investments are included in other assets, and FHN&#8217;s proportionate share of income or loss is included in noninterest income. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. For purposes of comparability, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 

Business Combinations. FHN accounts for acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," which requires acquired assets and liabilities (other than tax, certain benefit plan balances, and starting in 2019 certain lease-related assets and liabilities) to be recorded at fair value. Business combinations are included in the financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. 

Revenues. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied in an amount that reflects the consideration FHN expects to be entitled. FHN derives a significant portion of its revenues from fee-based services. Noninterest income from transaction-based fees is generally recognized immediately upon completion of the transaction. Noninterest income from service-based fees is generally recognized over the period in which FHN provides the service. Any services performed over time generally require that FHN render services each period and therefore FHN measures progress in completing these services based upon the passage of time and recognizes revenue as invoiced. 

Following is a discussion of FHN's key revenues within the scope of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and all related amendments, except as noted. 

Fixed Income. Fixed income includes fixed income securities sales, trading, and strategies, loan sales and derivative sales which are not within the scope of revenue from contracts with customers. Fixed income also includes investment banking fees earned for services related to underwriting debt securities and performing portfolio advisory services. FHN's performance obligation for underwriting services is satisfied on the trade date while advisory services is satisfied over time. 

Deposit Transactions and Cash Management. Deposit transactions and cash management activities include fees for services related to consumer and commercial deposit products (such as service charges on checking accounts), cash management products and services such as electronic transaction processing (Automated Clearing House and Electronic Data Interchange), account reconciliation services, cash vault services, lockbox processing, and information reporting to large corporate clients. FHN's obligation for transaction-based services is satisfied at the time of the transaction when the service is delivered while FHN's obligation for service based fees is satisfied over the course of each month. 

Brokerage, Management Fees and Commissions. Brokerage, management fees and commissions include fees for portfolio management, trade commissions, and annuity and mutual fund sales. Asset-based management fees are charged based on the market value of the client&#8217;s assets. The services associated with these revenues, which include investment advice and active management of client assets are generally performed and recognized over a month or quarter. Transactional revenues are based on the size and number of transactions executed at the client&#8217;s direction and are generally recognized on the trade date. 

Trust Services and Investment Management. Trust services and investment management fees include investment management, personal trust, employee benefits, and custodial trust services. Obligations for trust services are generally satisfied over time but may be satisfied at points in time for certain activities that are transactional in nature. 

Bankcard Income. Bankcard income includes credit interchange and network revenues and various card-related fees. Interchange income is recognized concurrently with the delivery of services on a daily basis. Card-related fees such as late fees, currency conversion, and cash advance fees are loan-related and excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09.

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Contract Balances. As of December 31, 2019, accounts receivable related to products and services on non-interest income were $ 8.7 million . For the year ended December 31, 2019, FHN had no material impairment losses on non-interest accounts receivable and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Condition as of December 31, 2019. 

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced, is not material. 

Refer to Note 20 - Business Segment Information for a reconciliation of disaggregated revenue by major product line and reportable segment. 

Debt Investment Securities. Available-for-sale ("AFS") and held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;). The review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the degree of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that security&#8217;s performance, the creditworthiness of the issuer and FHN&#8217;s intent and ability to hold the security. Debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses on debt securities AFS, including securities for which no credit impairment exists, are excluded from earnings and are reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity and the Statements of Comprehensive Income. Debt securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at amortized cost. Interest-only strips that are classified as securities AFS are valued at elected fair value. See Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for additional information. 

Realized gains and losses for investment securities are determined by the specific identification method and reported in noninterest income. Declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary based on FHN&#8217;s analysis of the facts and circumstances related to an individual investment, including securities that FHN has the intent to sell, are also determined by the specific identification method. For HTM debt securities, OTTI recognized is typically credit-related and is reported in noninterest income. For impaired AFS debt securities that FHN does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery but for which credit losses exist, the OTTI recognized is separated between the total impairment related to credit losses which is reported in noninterest income, and the impairment related to all other factors which is excluded from earnings and reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity and the Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Equity Investment Securities. Equity securities are classified in Other assets. 

National banks chartered by the federal government are, and banks organized under state law may apply to be, members of the Federal Reserve System. Each member bank is required to own stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"). Given this requirement, FRB stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as collateral for loans. Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) network requires ownership of capital stock. Member banks are entitled to borrow funds from the FHLB and are required to pledge mortgage loans as collateral. Investments in the FHLB are non-transferable and, generally, membership is maintained primarily to provide a source of liquidity as needed. FRB and FHLB stock are recorded at cost and are subject to impairment reviews. FHN's subsidiary, First Horizon Bank, was a member bank throughout 2019, initially as a national bank and later as a state member bank. 

Other equity investments primarily consist of mutual funds which are marked to fair value through earnings. Smaller balances of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost minus impairment with adjustments through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase. FHN purchases short-term securities under agreements to resell which are accounted for as collateralized financings except where FHN does not have an agreement to sell the same or substantially the same securities before maturity at a fixed or determinable price. All of FHN&#8217;s securities purchased under agreements to resell are recognized as collateralized financings. Securities delivered under these transactions are delivered to either the dealer custody account at the FRB or to the applicable counterparty. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are offered to cash management customers as an automated, collateralized investment account. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are also used by the consumer/commercial bank to obtain favorable borrowing rates on its purchased funds. All of FHN's securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured borrowings. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 126 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Collateral is valued daily and FHN may require counterparties to deposit additional securities or cash as collateral, or FHN may return cash or securities previously pledged by counterparties, or FHN may be required to post additional securities or cash as collateral, based on the contractual requirements for these transactions. 

FHN&#8217;s fixed income business utilizes securities borrowing arrangements as part of its trading operations. Securities borrowing transactions generally require FHN to deposit cash with the securities lender. The amount of cash advanced is recorded within Securities purchased under agreements to resell in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. These transactions are not considered purchases and the securities borrowed are not recognized by FHN. FHN does not conduct securities lending transactions. 

Loans Held-for-Sale. Loans originated or purchased for which management lacks the intent to hold are included in loans held-for-sale in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. FHN has elected the fair value option on a prospective basis for certain mortgage loans held-for-sale and repurchased loans that are not governmentally insured. Such loans are carried at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized in the other income section of the Consolidated Statements of Income. For mortgage loans originated for sale for which the fair value option was elected, loan origination fees were recorded by FHN when earned and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. See Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for additional information. FHN accounts for all other loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or market value (&#8220;LOCOM&#8221;). 

Loans. Generally, loans are stated at principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income. Interest on loans is recognized on an accrual basis at the applicable interest rate on the principal amount outstanding. Loan origination fees and direct costs as well as premiums and discounts are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms. Unamortized net fees or costs, premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income upon early repayment of the loans. Cash collections from loans that were fully charged off prior to acquisition are recognized in noninterest income. Loan commitment fees are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. 

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or on a case-by-case basis if FHN continues to receive payments, but there are other borrower-specific issues. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The accrual status policy for commercial troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) follows the same internal policies and procedures as other commercial portfolio loans. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Residential real estate secured loans discharged in bankruptcy that have not been reaffirmed by the borrower (&#8220;discharged bankruptcies&#8221;) are placed on nonaccrual regardless of delinquency status and are reported as TDRs. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Current second lien residential real estate loans that are junior to first liens are placed on nonaccrual status if the first lien is 90 or more days past due, is a bankruptcy, or is a troubled debt restructuring. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Consumer real estate (HELOC and residential real estate installment loans), if not already on nonaccrual per above situations, are placed on nonaccrual if the loan is 30 or more days delinquent at the time of modification and is also determined to be a TDR. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Government guaranteed/insured residential mortgage loans remain on accrual (even if the loan falls into one of the above categories) because the collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. 

##TABLE_END For commercial and consumer loans within each portfolio segment and class that have been placed on nonaccrual status, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed and charged against interest income when the loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to recover the principal balance and accrued interest. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are normally applied to outstanding principal first. Once all principal has been received, additional interest payments are recognized on a cash basis as interest income. 

Generally, commercial and consumer loans within each portfolio segment and class that have been placed on nonaccrual status can be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest is current and FHN expects full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. This typically requires that a borrower make payments in accordance with the contractual terms for a sustained period of time (generally for a minimum of six months) before being returned to accrual status. For TDRs, FHN may also consider a borrower&#8217;s sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring in assessing whether the borrower can meet the restructured terms, as it may indicate whether the borrower is capable of servicing the level of debt under the modified terms. 

Residential real estate loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are not returned to accrual status. For current second liens that have been placed on nonaccrual because the first lien is 90 or more days past due or is a TDR or bankruptcy, the second lien may be returned to accrual upon pay-off or cure of the first lien. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 127 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Charge-offs. For all commercial and consumer loan portfolio segments, all losses of principal are charged to the allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") in the period in which the loan is deemed to be uncollectible. 

For consumer loans, the timing of a full or partial charge-off generally depends on the loan type and delinquency status. Generally, for the consumer real estate and permanent mortgage portfolio segments, a loan will be either partially or fully charged-off when it becomes 180 days past due. At this time, if the collateral value does not support foreclosure, balances are fully charged-off and other avenues of recovery are pursued. If the collateral value supports foreclosure, the loan is charged-down to net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell) and is placed on nonaccrual status. For residential real estate loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower, the fair value of the collateral position is assessed at the time FHN is made aware of the discharge and the loan is charged down to the net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell). Within the credit card and other portfolio segment, credit cards and installment loans secured by automobiles are normally charged-off upon reaching 180 days past due while other non-real estate consumer loans are charged-off upon reaching 120 days past due. 

Impaired Loans. Impaired loans include nonaccrual commercial loans greater than $ 1 million and modified consumer and commercial loans that have been classified as a TDR and are individually measured for impairment under the guidance of ASC 310. TDRs are always reported as such unless the TDR has exhibited sustained performance, was reported as a TDR over a year-end, and the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification. 

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans. ASC 310-30 &#8220;Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,&#8221; provides guidance for acquired loans that have exhibited deterioration of credit quality between origination and the time of acquisition and for which the timely collection of the interest and principal is not reasonably assured (&#8220;PCI loans&#8221;). PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value which is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at acquisition date. The expected cash flows include all contractually expected amounts (including interest) and incorporate an estimate for future expected credit losses, pre-payment assumptions, and yield requirement for a market participant, among other things. To the extent possible, certain PCI loans were aggregated into pools with composite interest rate and cash flows expected to be collected for the pool. Aggregation into loan pools is based upon common risk characteristics that include similar credit risk or risk ratings, and one or more predominant risk characteristics. Each PCI pool is accounted for as a single unit. 

Accretable yield is initially established at acquisition and is the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the initial investment in the loan and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans. Nonaccretable difference is initially established at acquisition and is the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition. FHN estimates expected cash flows for PCI loans on a quarterly basis. Increases in expected cash flows from the last measurement result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference (or allowance for loan losses to the extent any has previously been recorded) with a prospective positive impact on interest income. Decreases to the expected cash flows result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses through provision expense. 

FHN does not report PCI loans as nonperforming loans due to the accretion of interest income. Additionally, PCI loans that have been pooled and subsequently modified will not be reported as troubled debt restructurings since the pool is the unit of measurement. 

Allowance for Loan Losses. The ALLL is maintained at a level that management determines is sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan losses and loan recoveries and is decreased by loan charge-offs. The ALLL is determined in accordance with ASC 450-20-50 "Contingencies - Accruals for Loss Contingencies" and is composed of reserves for commercial loans evaluated based on pools of credit graded loans and reserves for pools of smaller-balance homogeneous consumer and commercial loans. The reserve factors applied to these pools are an estimate of probable incurred losses based on management&#8217;s evaluation of historical net losses from loans with similar characteristics. Additionally, the ALLL includes specific reserves established in accordance with ASC 310-10-35 for loans determined by management to be individually impaired as well as reserves associated with PCI loans. Management uses analytical models to estimate probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The models, which are primarily driven by historical losses, are carefully reviewed to identify trends that may not be captured in the historical loss factors used in the models. Management uses qualitative adjustments for those items not yet captured in the models like current events, recent trends in the portfolio, current underwriting guidelines, and local and macroeconomic trends, among other things. 

The nature of the process by which FHN determines the appropriate ALLL requires the exercise of considerable judgment. See Note 5 - Allowance for Loan Losses for a discussion of FHN&#8217;s ALLL methodology and a description of the models utilized in the estimation process for the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 128 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Key components of the estimation process are as follows: (1) commercial loans determined by management to be individually impaired loans are evaluated individually and specific reserves are determined based on the difference between the outstanding loan amount and the estimated net realizable value of the collateral (if collateral dependent), the present value of expected future cash flows or by observable market prices; (2) individual commercial loans not considered to be individually impaired are segmented based on similar credit risk characteristics and evaluated on a pool basis; (3) reserve rates for the commercial segment are calculated based on historical net charge-offs and are subject to adjustment by management to reflect current events, trends, and conditions (including economic considerations and trends); (4) management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred losses reflects the reserve rates applied against the balance of loans in the commercial segment of the loan portfolio; (5) consumer loans are generally segmented based on loan type; (6) reserve amounts for each consumer portfolio segment are calculated using analytical models based on delinquency trends and net loss experience and are subject to adjustment by management to reflect current events, trends, and conditions (including economic considerations and trends); and (7) the reserve amount for each consumer portfolio segment reflects management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred losses in the consumer segment of the loan portfolio. 

Impairment related to individually impaired loans is measured in accordance with ASC 310-10. For all commercial portfolio segments, commercial TDRs and other individually impaired commercial loans are measured based on the present value of expected future payments discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate (&#8220;the DCF method&#8221;), observable market prices, or for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell). Impaired loans also include consumer TDRs. 

Future adjustments to the ALLL may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates or, if required by regulators, based upon information at the time of their examinations or upon future regulatory guidance. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates. 

Premises and Equipment. Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and include additions that materially extend the useful lives of existing premises and equipment. All other maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred. Premises and equipment held-for-sale are generally valued at appraised values which reference recent disposition values for similar property types but also consider marketability discounts for vacant properties. The valuations of premises and equipment held-for-sale are reduced by estimated costs to sell. Impairments, and any subsequent recoveries, are recorded in noninterest expense. Gains and losses on dispositions are reflected in noninterest income and expense, respectively. 

Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and are recorded as noninterest expense. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease periods or the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Useful lives utilized in determining depreciation for furniture, fixtures and equipment and for buildings are three years to fifteen years and seven years to forty-five years , respectively. 

Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO"). Real estate acquired by foreclosure or other real estate-owned consists of properties that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt. These properties are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan amount or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the real estate. At the time acquired, and in conjunction with the transfer from loans to OREO, there is a charge-off against the ALLL if the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the loan&#8217;s cost basis. Subsequent declines in fair value and gains or losses on dispositions, if any, are charged to All other expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Properties acquired by foreclosure in compliance with HUD servicing guidelines prior to January 1, 2015, are included in &#8220;OREO&#8221; and are carried at the estimated amount of the underlying government insurance or guarantee. On December 31, 2019, FHN had $ 2.2 million of these properties. 

Required developmental costs associated with acquired property under construction are capitalized and included in determining the estimated net realizable value of the property, which is reviewed periodically, and any write-downs are charged against current earnings. 

Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of &#8220;Other intangible assets&#8221; and &#8220;Goodwill.&#8221; Other intangible assets represent customer lists and relationships, acquired contracts, covenants not to compete and premium on purchased deposits, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets related to acquired deposit bases are primarily amortized over 10 years using an accelerated method. Management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining useful life or carrying value of amortizing intangibles should be revised. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses less identifiable intangible assets. On an annual basis, FHN assesses goodwill for impairment. 

Derivative Financial Instruments. FHN accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815 which requires recognition of all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 129 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

through adjustments to either accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity or current earnings. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell a derivative asset or paid to transfer a derivative liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the transaction date. Fair value is determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. FHN has elected to present its derivative assets and liabilities gross on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Amounts of collateral posted or received have not been netted with the related derivatives unless the collateral amounts are considered legal settlements of the related derivative positions. See Note 22 - Derivatives for discussion on netting of derivatives. 

FHN prepares written hedge documentation, identifying the risk management objective and designating the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge as applicable, or as a free-standing derivative instrument entered into as an economic hedge or to meet customers&#8217; needs. All transactions designated as ASC 815 hedges must be assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in earnings. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings as the hedged transaction impacts net income. Prior to 2018, ineffectiveness in debt and cash flow hedges was recorded in noninterest expense. Starting in 2018, for fair value hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of effectiveness is recorded to the same financial statement line item (e.g., interest expense) used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the entire fair value change of the hedging instrument that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and later recycled into earnings as the hedged transaction(s) affect net income with the income statement effects recorded in the same financial statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item (e.g., interest income). For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are recognized currently in earnings. See Note 22 - Derivatives for additional information. 

Cash flows from derivative contracts are reported as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Leases. At inception, all arrangements are evaluated to determine if they contain a lease, which is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is deemed to exist when a lessor has granted and a lessee has received both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. 

Lessee. As a lessee, FHN recognizes lease (right-of-use) assets and lease liabilities for all leasing arrangements with lease terms that are greater than one year. The lease asset and lease liability are recognized at the present value of estimated future lease payments, including estimated renewal periods, with the discount rate reflecting a fully-collateralized rate matching the estimated lease term. Renewal options are included in the estimated lease term if they are considered reasonably certain of exercise. Periods covered by termination options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain they will not be exercised. Additionally, prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives and initial direct costs related to lease arrangements are recognized within the right-of-use asset. Each lease is classified as a financing or operating lease which depends on the relationship of the lessee&#8217;s rights to the economic value of the leased asset. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in earnings, resulting in higher expense in the earlier portion of the lease term. For operating leases, a single lease cost is calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. Substantially all of FHN&#8217;s lessee arrangements are classified as operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, FHN does not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Lease assumptions and classification are reassessed upon the occurrence of events that result in changes to the estimated lease term or consideration. Modifications to lease contracts are evaluated to determine 1) if a right to use an additional asset has been obtained, 2) if only the lease term and/or consideration have been revised or 3) if a full or partial termination has occurred. If an additional right-of use-asset has been obtained, the modification is treated as a separate contract and its classification is evaluated as a new lease arrangement. If only the lease term or consideration are changed, the lease liability is revalued with an offset to the lease asset and the lease classification is re-assessed. If a modification results in a full or partial termination of the lease, the lease liability is revalued through earnings along with a proportionate reduction in the value of the related lease asset and subsequent expense recognition is similar to a new lease arrangement. 

Lease assets are evaluated for impairment when triggering events occur, such as a change in management intent regarding the continued occupation of the leased space. If a lease asset is impaired, it is written down to the present value of estimated future 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 130 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

cash flows and the prospective expense recognition for that lease follows the accelerated expense recognition methodology applicable to finance leases, even if it remains classified as an operating lease. 

Sublease arrangements are accounted for consistent with the lessor accounting described below. Sublease arrangements are evaluated to determine if changes to estimates for the primary lease are warranted or if the sublease terms reflect impairment of the related lease asset. 

Lease assets are recognized in Other assets and lease liabilities are recognized in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Since substantially all of its leasing arrangements relate to real estate, FHN records lease expense, and any related sublease income, within Occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Lessor. As a lessor, FHN also evaluates its lease arrangements to determine whether a finance lease or an operating lease exists and utilizes the rate implicit in the lease arrangement as the discount rate to calculate the present value of future cash flows. Depending upon the terms of the individual agreements, finance leases represent either sales-type or direct financing leases, both of which require de-recognition of the asset being leased with offsetting recognition of a lease receivable that is evaluated for impairment similar to loans. Currently, all of FHN&#8217;s lessor arrangements are considered operating leases. 

Lease income for operating leases is recognized over the life of the lease, generally on a straight line basis. Lease incentives and initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the lease. Lease income is not significant for any reporting periods and is classified as a reduction of Occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Advertising and Public Relations. Advertising and public relations costs are generally expensed as incurred. 

Income Taxes. FHN accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method pursuant to ASC 740, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets ("DTAs") and liabilities ("DTLs") for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, FHN&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax basis of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on DTAs and DTLs is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Additionally, DTAs are subject to a &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test to determine whether the full amount of the DTAs should be recognized in the financial statements. FHN evaluates the likelihood of realization of the DTA based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time, including (as appropriate) scheduled reversals of DTLs, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. If the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test is not met, a valuation allowance must be established against the DTA. In the event FHN determines that DTAs are realizable in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, FHN would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 

FHN records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority is recognized. FHN's ASC 740 policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax asset/liability line in the consolidated balance sheet. 

FHN and its eligible subsidiaries are included in a consolidated federal income tax return. FHN files separate returns for subsidiaries that are not eligible to be included in a consolidated federal income tax return. Based on the laws of the applicable state where it conducts business operations, FHN either files consolidated, combined, or separate returns. FHN&#8217;s federal consolidated tax returns are currently under audit for 2013 through 2015 and the statutes for those years have been extended through December 31, 2020. Federal tax refund claims for Capital Bank Financial Corporation for 2010 - 2012 are under examination by the IRS. Several of FHN&#8217;s state returns are currently under examination. 

Earnings per Share. Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period. Diluted earnings per share in net income periods is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential dilutive common shares resulting from performance shares and units, restricted shares and units, and options granted under FHN&#8217;s equity compensation plans and deferred compensation arrangements had been issued. FHN utilizes the treasury stock 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 131 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

method in this calculation. Diluted earnings per share does not reflect an adjustment for potentially dilutive shares in periods in which a net loss available to common shareholders exists. 

Equity Compensation. FHN accounts for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the grant date fair value of an award to determine the expense to be recognized over the life of the award. Stock options are valued using an option-pricing model, such as Black-Scholes. Restricted and performance shares and share units are valued at the stock price on the grant date. Awards with post-vesting transfer restrictions are discounted using models that reflect market considerations for illiquidity. For awards with service vesting criteria, expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. For awards vesting based on a performance measure, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. If a performance period extends beyond the required service term, total expense is adjusted for changes in estimated achievement through the end of the performance period. Some performance awards include a total shareholder return modifier (&#8220;TSR Modifier&#8221;) that operates after determination of the performance criteria, affecting only the quantity of awards issued if the minimum performance threshold is attained. The effect of the TSR Modifier is included in the grant date fair value of the related performance awards using a Monte Carlo valuation technique. The fair value of equity awards with cash payout requirements, as well as awards for which fair value cannot be estimated at grant date, is remeasured each reporting period through vesting date. Performance awards with pre-grant date achievement criteria are expensed over the period from the start of the performance period through the end of the service vesting term. Awards are amortized using the nonsubstantive vesting methodology which requires that expense associated with awards having only service vesting criteria that continue vesting after retirement be recognized over a period ending no later than an employee&#8217;s retirement eligibility date. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Provision. The repurchase and foreclosure provision is the charge to earnings necessary to maintain the liability at a level that reflects management&#8217;s best estimate of losses associated with the repurchase of loans previously transferred in whole loans sales or securitizations, or make whole requests as of the balance sheet date. See Note 17 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures for discussion related to FHN&#8217;s obligations to repurchase such loans. 

Legal Costs. Generally, legal costs are expensed as incurred.Costs related to equity issuances are netted against Capital surplus. Costs related to debt issuances are included in debt issuance costs that are recorded within Term borrowings. 

Contingency Accruals. Contingent liabilities arise in the ordinary course of business, including those related to lawsuits, arbitration, mediation, and other forms of litigation. FHN establishes loss contingency liabilities for matters when loss is both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC 450-20-50 &#8220;Contingencies - Accruals for Loss Contingencies&#8221;. If loss for a matter is probable and a range of possible loss outcomes is the best estimate available, accounting guidance generally requires a liability to be established at the low end of the range. Expected recoveries from insurance and indemnification arrangements are recognized if they are considered equally as probable and reasonably estimable as the related loss contingency up to the recognized amount of the estimated loss. Gain contingencies and expected recoveries from insurance and indemnification arrangements in excess of the associated recorded estimated losses are generally recognized when received. Recognized recoveries are recorded as offsets to the related expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The favorable resolution of a gain contingency generally results in the recognition of other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Contingencies assumed in business combinations are evaluated through the end of the one-year post-closing measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value of the contingency can be determined during the measurement period, recognition occurs as part of the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired business. If the acquisition-date fair value of the contingency cannot be determined, but loss is considered probable as of the acquisition date and can be reasonably estimated within the measurement period, then the estimated amount is recorded within acquisition accounting. If the requirements for inclusion of the contingency as part of the acquisition are not met, subsequent recognition of the contingency is included in earnings. 

Summary of Accounting Changes. Effective January 1, 2019, FHN adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-02, &#8220;Leases,&#8221; which requires a lessee to recognize in its statement of condition a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged from prior standards. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. All other leases must be classified as financing or operating leases which depends on the relationship of the lessee&#8217;s rights to the economic value of the leased asset. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in earnings, resulting in higher expense in the earlier portion of the lease term. For operating leases, a single lease cost is calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 132 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Effective January 1, 2019, FHN adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-11, &#8220;Leases - Targeted Improvements,&#8221; which provides an election for a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon initial adoption of ASU 2016-02. Alternatively, under the initial guidance of ASU 2016-02, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Both adoption alternatives include a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply, which would result in continuing to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous requirements (unless the lease is modified) except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous requirements. ASU 2016-02 also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from lease arrangements. Upon adoption, FHN utilized the cumulative effect transition alternative provided by ASU 2018-11. FHN utilized the lease classification practical expedients and the short-term lease exemption upon adoption. FHN also has elected to determine the discount rate on leases as of the effective date and elected to use hindsight in determining lease terms as well as impairments of lease assets resulting from lease abandonments upon adoption. The table below summarizes the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2019, for line items in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Lease assets of approximately $ 185 million are included in Other Assets. Lease liabilities of approximately $ 204 million are included in Other Liabilities. The after-tax decrease in Undivided Profits reflects the recognition of deferred gains associated with prior sale-leaseback transactions, revisions to the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and adjustments of lease expense to reflect revised lease duration estimates.

Effective January 1, 2019, FHN adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-15, &#8220;Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,&#8221; which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). Capitalized implemented costs are required to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement which includes the non-cancellable period of the arrangement plus periods covered by (1) an option to extend the arrangement if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) an option to terminate the arrangement if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option, and (3) an option to extend (or not to terminate) the arrangement in which exercise of the option is in the control of the vendor. ASU 2018-15 also requires application of the impairment guidance applicable to long-lived assets to the capitalized implementation costs. Amortization expense related to capitalized implementation costs must be presented in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement and payments for capitalized implementation costs will be classified in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element. Capitalized implementation costs will be presented in the statement of financial position in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented. FHN elected early adoption of ASU 2018-15 using the prospective transition method and the effects of adoption were not significant. 

In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments,&#8221; which makes several revisions and clarifications to the accounting for these items. The revisions related to ASU 2016-03 (Topic 326) are discussed below. ASU 2019-04 clarifies several aspects of fair hedge accounting, including the application to partial term fair value hedges. ASU 2019-04 provides an election regarding the timing for amortization of basis adjustments to hedged items in fair value hedges, indicating that amortization may, but is not required to, commence prior to the end of the hedge relationship. ASU 2019-04 also provides additional guidance related to the application of the hypothetical derivative method and first-payments-received method in cash flow hedges. Further, ASU 2019-04 indicates that remeasurement of an equity security without a readily determinable fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer represents a non-recurring fair value measurement and the related disclosure requirements apply to the remeasurement event. The hedging updates are effective at the beginning of the first annual reporting period after issuance with early adoption permitted. The financial instruments measurement and disclosure changes are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 133 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. FHN early adopted these portions of ASU 2019-04 in second quarter 2019 and the effects were not significant based on its existing accounting practices. 

Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; which revises the measurement and recognition of credit losses for assets measured at amortized cost (e.g., held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) loans and debt securities) and available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) debt securities. Under ASU 2016-13, for assets measured at amortized cost, the current expected credit loss (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) is measured as the difference between amortized cost and the net amount expected to be collected. This represents a departure from existing GAAP as the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; methodology for recognizing credit losses delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Under CECL the full amount of expected credit losses will be recognized at the time of loan origination. The measurement of current expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Additionally, current disclosures of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables will be further disaggregated by year of origination. ASU 2016-13 leaves the methodology for measuring credit losses on AFS debt securities largely unchanged, with the maximum credit loss representing the difference between amortized cost and fair value. However, such credit losses will be recognized through an allowance for credit losses, which permits recovery of previously recognized credit losses if circumstances change. 

ASU 2016-13 also revises the recognition of credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (&#8220;PCD assets&#8221;). For PCD assets, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a credit loss expense for PCD assets. Interest income for PCD assets will be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer&#8217;s assessment of credit losses at acquisition. Currently, credit losses for purchased credit-impaired assets are included in the initial basis of the assets with subsequent declines in credit resulting in expense while subsequent improvements in credit are reflected as an increase in the future yield from the assets. For non-PCD assets, expected credit losses will be recognized through earnings upon acquisition and the entire premium or discount will be accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the loan. 

The provisions of ASU 2016-13 will be generally adopted through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in the year of adoption. Prospective implementation is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary-impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) had been previously recognized. Amounts previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) as of the date of adoption that relate to improvements in cash flows expected to be collected will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the asset. Recoveries of amounts previously written off relating to improvements in cash flows after the date of adoption will be recorded in earnings when received. A prospective transition approach will be used for existing PCD assets where, upon adoption, the amortized cost basis will be increased to offset the initial recognition of the allowance for credit losses. Thus, an entity will not be required to reassess its purchased financial assets that exist as of the date of adoption to determine whether they would have met at acquisition the new criteria of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination. An entity will accrete the remaining noncredit discount (based on the revised amortized cost basis) into interest income at the effective interest rate at the adoption date. 

ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. FHN&#8217;s most significant implementation activities included review of loan portfolio segments and classes, identification and evaluation of collateral dependent loans and loans secured by collateral replenishment arrangements, selection of measurement methodologies and related model development, data accumulation and verification, development of loan life estimates, identification of reasonable and supportable forecast periods, selection of timelines and methods for reversion to unadjusted historical information, multiple preliminary analyses including parallel runs against existing loan loss estimation processes, and design and evaluation of internal controls over the new estimation processes. FHN will utilize undiscounted cash flow methods for loans except for troubled debt restructurings, which require use of discounted cash flow methodologies. 

Based on implementation efforts, FHN expects to incur a decrease to Undivided profits of approximately $ 100 million as of January 1, 2020, related to an increase in the allowance for loan losses as well as an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments. A significant portion of this impact relates to increased reserves within the consumer portfolios, given the longer contractual maturities associated with many of these products as well as reserves related to acquired loans. FHN expects the coverage ratio for total loans to be approximately 100 basis points at adoption but would expect future coverage to be affected by changes in economic forecasts, portfolio composition and loan terms. The total impact from adoption to FHN's regulatory 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 134 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

capital ratio CET1 is anticipated to be a decrease of approximately 7 basis points in 2020. Management is in the final stages of documenting the accounting, reporting and governance processes associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

FHN also assessed several asset classes other than loans that are within the scope of CECL and determined that the adoption effects for the change in measurement of credit risk were minimal for these classes. This includes Fed funds sold which have no history of credit losses due to their short (typically overnight) duration and counterparty risk assessment processes. This also includes securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell which have collateral maintenance agreements that incorporate master netting provisions resulting in minimal uncollateralized positions as of any date as evidenced by the disclosures provided in Note 23 - Master Netting and Similar Agreements-Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, and Securities Borrowing Transactions. Additionally, FHN has also evaluated the composition of its AFS securities and determined that the changes in ASU 2016-13 will not have a significant effect on the current portfolio. 

ASU 2019-04 provides an election to either not measure or measure separately an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable (&#8220;AIR"). Entities electing to not measure an allowance for AIR must write off uncollectible interest in a timely manner. Additionally, an election is provided for the write off of uncollectible interest to be recorded either as a reversal of interest income or a charge against the allowance for credit losses or a combination of both. Disclosures are required depending upon which elections are made. 

ASU 2019-04 also clarifies that when loans and securities are transferred between balance sheet categories (e.g., loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale or securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale) the associated allowance for credit losses should be reversed to income and prospective accounting follows the requirements for the new classification. Further, ASU 2019-04 clarifies that recoveries should be incorporated within the estimation of the allowance for credit losses. Expected recoveries should not exceed the aggregate amount of prior write offs and expected future write offs. The inclusion of expected recoveries in the measurement of expected credit losses may result in a negative credit allowance in certain circumstances. Additionally, for collateral dependent financial assets, the allowance for credit losses that is added to the amortized cost basis should not exceed amounts previously written off. 

ASU 2019-04 also makes several changes when a discounted cash flow approach is used to measure expected credit losses. ASU 2019-04 removes ASU 2016-03&#8217;s prohibition of using projections of future interest rate environments when using a discounted cash flow method to measure expected credit losses on variable-rate financial instruments. If an entity uses projections or expectations of future interest rate environments in estimating expected cash flows, the same assumptions should be used in determining the effective interest rate used to discount those expected cash flows. The effective interest rate should also be adjusted to consider the effects of expected prepayments on the timing of expected future cash flows. ASU 2019-04 provides an election to adjust the effective interest rate used in discounting expected cash flows to isolate credit risk in measuring the allowance for credit losses. Further, the discount rate should not be adjusted for subsequent changes in expected prepayments if a financial asset is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. 

Related to collateral-dependent financial assets, ASU 2019-04 requires inclusion of estimated costs to sell in the measurement of expected credit losses in situations where the entity intends to sell rather than operate the collateral. Additionally, the estimated costs to sell should be undiscounted when the entity intends to sell rather than operate the collateral. 

Finally, ASU 2019-04 specifies that contractual renewal or extension options, except those treated as derivatives, should be included in the determination of the contractual term for a financial asset when included in the original or modified contract as of the reporting date if they are not unconditionally cancellable by the entity. 

The effective date and transition requirements for these components of ASU 2019-04 are consistent with the requirements for ASU 2016-13 and FHN incorporated these changes and revisions within its implementation efforts. Based on its previous existing practices for the timely write off uncollectible AIR, FHN elected to not measure an allowance for credit losses for AIR and to continue recognition of related write offs as a reversal of interest income. 

In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Targeted Transition Relief,&#8221; which provides an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis that are in the scope of ASU 2016-13, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2019-05 are consistent with the requirements for ASU 2016-13. FHN did not elect to apply the fair value option to any asset classes that are in scope for CECL. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 135 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses&#8221; which clarifies that expected recoveries should be included in the amortized cost basis previously written off or expected to be written off in the valuation allowance for PCD assets. ASU 2019-11 also clarifies that recoveries or expected recoveries of the unamortized noncredit discount or premium should not be included in the allowance for credit losses. ASU 2019-11 provides specific transition relief for existing troubled debt restructurings and extends the disclosure relief of ASU 2019-04 for accrued interest receivable balances to additional relevant disclosures involving amortized cost basis. Related to the assessment of credit risk for collateralized assets, ASU 2019-11 indicates that an entity should assess whether it reasonably expects the borrower will be able to continually replenish collateral securing the financial asset to apply the practical expedient of ASU 2016-13 while also requiring an estimation of expected credit losses for any difference between the amount of the amortized cost basis that is greater than the fair value of the collateral securing the financial asset. 

The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2019-11 are consistent with the requirements for ASU 2016-13 and FHN incorporated these changes and revisions within its implementation efforts and the effects are embedded within the adoption effects of ASU 2016-13. Consistent with non-PCD assets, the effect of including recoveries and expected recoveries within the measurement of expected credit losses for PCD assets may result in a negative credit allowance in certain circumstances.

Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions and Divestitures 

On November 4, 2019, FHN and IBERIABANK Corporation (&#8220;IBKC&#8221;) announced that they had entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which IBKC will merge with FHN in a merger-of-equals transaction. IBKC, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, has 319 offices in 12 states, mostly in the southern and southeastern U.S., and has reported $ 31.7 billion of total assets, $ 24.0 billion in loans, and $ 25.2 billion in deposits, at December 31, 2019. IBKC's common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol IBKC. Under the merger agreement, each share of IBKC common stock will be converted into 4.584 shares of FHN common stock. After closing, FHN expects IBKC common shares will be converted into approximately 44 percent of the then-outstanding shares of FHN common stock. The merger agreement requires FHN to expand its board of directors to seventeen persons; after closing, eight board positions will be held by current IBKC directors, and nine will be held by current FHN directors. FHN expects the transaction to close mid-2020, subject to regulatory approvals, approval by the shareholders of FHN and of IBKC, and other customary conditions. Merger and integration expenses related to the pending merger of equals with IBKC are recorded in FHN&#8217;s Corporate segment. 

Total merger expenses for the IBKC merger recognized during 2019 were as follows:

On November 8, 2019, FHN announced an agreement for First Horizon Bank to purchase 30 branches from SunTrust Bank in conjunction with SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s merger with BB&#38;T Corporation, which created Truist Financial Corp. As part of the agreement, FHN will assume approximately $ 2.4 billion of branch deposits for a 3.40 percent deposit premium and purchase approximately $ 410 million of branch loans. The branches are in communities in North Carolina ( 20 branches), Virginia ( 8 branches), and Georgia ( 2 branches). FHN expects the purchase to close in second quarter 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. 

On November 30, 2017, FHN completed its acquisition of Capital Bank Financial Corporation ("CBF") and its subsidiaries, including Capital Bank Corporation, for an aggregate of 92,042,232 shares of FHN common stock and $ 423.6 million in cash in a transaction valued at $ 2.2 billion . In second quarter 2018, FHN canceled 2,373,220 common shares which had been issued but set aside for certain shareholders of CBF who have commenced a dissenters' appraisal process resulting in a reduction in equity consideration and an increase in cash consideration of $ 46.0 million . In October 2019 this matter was resolved and the financial statement effects were not significant. CBF operated 178 branches in North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida and Virginia at the time of closing. In relation to the acquisition, FHN acquired approximately $ 9.8 billion in assets, including approximately $ 7.3 billion in loans and $ 1.2 billion in AFS securities, and assumed approximately $ 8.1 billion of CBF deposits. 

The following schedule details acquired assets and liabilities and consideration paid, as well as adjustments to record the assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values as of November 30, 2017. These fair value measurements are based on third party and internal valuations.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

Amounts reflect adjustments made to provisional fair value estimates during the measurement period ending November 30, 2018. These adjustments were recorded in FHN's Consolidated Statement of Condition in 2018 with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

Amount represents a conformity adjustment to align with FHN presentation. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (c) 

Amount primarily relates to a net deferred tax asset recorded for the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments and adjustments for acquired tax contingencies. 

##TABLE_END In relation to the acquisition, FHN recorded goodwill of approximately $ 1.2 billion , representing the excess of acquisition consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. All goodwill has been attributed to FHN&#8217;s Regional Banking segment (refer to Note 7 - Intangible Assets for additional information). This goodwill is the result of 1) the addition of an experienced workforce, 2) expected synergies to be realized within overlapping banking markets, 3) operational efficiencies obtained through integration of back office functions and 4) proportionately lower net operating costs from a larger company scale. $ 17.0 million of goodwill was determined to be deductible for tax purposes as a result of tax bases carryover resulting from prior CBF acquisitions. FHN&#8217;s operating results for 2018 and 2017 include the operating results of the assets and liabilities acquired from CBF subsequent to the acquisition on November 30, 2017. 

Following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented above. 

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. 

Securities available-for-sale: Fair values for securities are based on quoted prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs obtained from market transactions in similar securities. Securities held-to-maturity were reclassified to securities available-for-sale based on FHN&#8217;s intent at closing. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 138 

Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued) 

Loans and loans held-for-sale: Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan, amortization status and current discount rates. Loans were aggregated according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. Loans held-for-sale were classified according to FHN&#8217;s intent at closing. The valuation of loans held-for-sale reflects contractual or bid prices. 

Intangible assets: Core deposit intangible ("CDI") represents the value of the relationships with deposit customers. The fair value was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternate costs of funds, and the interest costs associated with customer deposits. The CDI is being amortized over 10 years using an accelerated methodology based upon the period over which estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received. Lease intangibles are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which compares the current contractual rental payments to estimated current market rents for the property. 

Premises and Equipment: Land and buildings held-for-use are valued at appraised values, which reflect considerations of recent disposition values for similar property types with adjustments for characteristics of individual properties. Locations held-for-sale are valued at appraised values which also reference recent disposition values for similar property types but also considers marketability discounts for vacant properties. The valuations of locations held-for-sale are reduced by estimated costs to sell. Other fixed assets are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which reflects estimates of the future value of the assets to a hypothetical buyer. 

OREO: OREO properties are valued at estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the real estate. Estimated fair value is determined using appraised values which includes consideration of recent disposition values for similar property types with adjustments for characteristics of individual properties. 

Deposits: The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the acquisition date. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation using the remaining duration of the accounts and reflects the difference in interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Other short-term borrowings: The carrying amount of these liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these liabilities. 

Term borrowings: The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analysis, based on estimated current borrowing rates for similar types of instruments and considers whether the debt is currently callable. Estimated discount rates are determined from the perspective of the post-merger combined entity rather than the acquiree and/or original issuers.

(a) Net income available to common shareholders is not meaningful for actual CBF results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2017 because of the effect of tax reform. 

The pro forma financial information and explanatory notes have been prepared to illustrate the effects of the merger between FHN and CBF under the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of each period presented, nor does it necessarily indicate the results of operations in future

periods or the future financial position of the combined entities. Cost savings and other business synergies related to the acquisition are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. 

This unaudited pro forma information combines the historical consolidated results of operations of FHN and CBF for the periods presented and gives effect to the following nonrecurring adjustments: 

Fair value adjustments: Pro forma adjustment to net interest income of $ 34.5 million and $ 46.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to record estimated amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on acquired loans, securities, deposits, and term borrowings. 

CBF accretion/amortization: Pro forma adjustment to net interest income of $ 24.4 million and $ 25.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to eliminate CBF amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on previously acquired loans, securities, and deposits. 

Amortization of acquired intangibles: Pro forma adjustment to noninterest expense of $ 15.8 million and $ 18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to record estimated amortization on acquired CDI and other lease intangibles. 

Other adjustments: Pro forma results also include adjustments related to the removal of CBF's intangible amortization expense, amortization of previously acquired lease intangibles, and FHN's merger-related costs. Also includes adjustments to depreciation expense to record estimated fair value marks for CBF tangible assets, as well as income-tax effects of pro forma adjustments. 

All expenses related to the merger and integration with CBF are recorded in FHN's Corporate segment. Integration activities were substantially completed in second quarter 2018. 

Total CBF merger and integration expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 are presented in the table below:

In first quarter 2018, FHN divested two branches, including approximately $ 30 million of deposits and $ 2 million of loans. The branches, both in Greeneville, Tennessee, were divested in connection with First Horizon's agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and commitments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which were entered into in connection with a customary review of FHN's merger with CBF. 

In second quarter 2018, FHN sold approximately $ 120 million UPB of its subprime auto loans. These loans, originally acquired as part of the CBF acquisition, did not fit within FHN's risk profile. Based on the sales price, a measurement period adjustment to the acquisition-date fair value of the subprime auto loans was recorded in second quarter 2018. A measurement period 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 140

adjustment was made in fourth quarter 2018 for other consumer loans acquired from CBF based on pricing information received from potential buyers. 

On April 3, 2017, FHN Financial (formerly FTN Financial or "FTNF") acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Coastal Securities, Inc. (&#8220;Coastal&#8221;), a national leader in the trading, securiti zation, and analysis of Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans, for appro ximately $ 131 million in cash. Coastal, which was based in Houston, TX, also traded United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) loans and fixed income products and provided municipal underwriting and advisory services to its clients. Coastal&#8217;s government-guaranteed loan products, combined with FHN Financial&#8217;s existing SBA trading activities, have established an additional major product sector for FHN Financial.

##TABLE_END

In relation to the acquisition, FHN has recorded $ 45.0 million in goodwill, representing the excess of acquisition consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired (refer to Note 7 - Intangible Assets for additional information), and all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill is the result of adding an experienced workforce, establishing an additional major product sector for FHN Financial, expected synergies, and other factors. FHN's operating results for 2017 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Coastal subsequent to the acquisition on April 3, 2017. 

In addition to the transactions mentioned above, FHN acquires or divests assets from time to time in transactions that are considered business combinations or divestitures but are not material to FHN individually or in the aggregate. In April 2019, FHN sold a subsidiary acquired as part of the CBF acquisition that did not fit within FHN's risk profile. The sale resulted in the removal of approximately $ 25 million UPB of subprime consumer loans from Loans held-for-sale on FHN's Consolidated Statements of Condition.

##TABLE_END

FHN has reviewed debt investment securities that were in unrealized loss positions in accordance with its accounting policy for OTTI and does not consider them other-than-temporarily impaired. For debt securities with unrealized losses, FHN does not intend to sell them and it is more-likely-than-not that FHN will not be required to sell them prior to recovery. The decline in value is primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit losses. 

The carrying amount of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value was $ 25.6 million and $ 21.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The year-to-date 2019 and 2018 gross amounts of upward and downward valuation adjustments were not significant. 

Unrealized gains of $ 7.0 million and unrealized losses of $ 1.5 million were recognized during 2019 and 2018 , respectively, for equity investments with readily determinable fair values. 

In 2018 FHN sold its remaining holdings of Visa Class B Shares resulting in a pre-tax gain of $ 212.9 million recognized within the Corporate segment. See the Other Derivatives section of Note 22 - Derivatives for more information regarding FHN&#8217;s Visa shares.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

In third quarter 2019, FHN corrected a previous mis-classification of commercial loans and reclassified approximately $ 410 million of market investor CRE loans from the C&#38;I portfolio to the CRE portfolio. These loans were identified during an internal review and assessment by management of certain loan populations, a portion of which relate to loans acquired as part of the Capital Bank merger. The reclassification of these loan balances between regional banking portfolios did not have an impact on FHN&#8217;s consolidated period-end or average balance sheet and had an immaterial effect on the allowance for loan losses. No adjustments were made to prior periods as the impact of the reclassification, including the effect on the allowance for loan losses was deemed to be immaterial in all periods. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) 

Balance as of December 31, 2018 includes $ 16.2 million of restricted real estate loans. See Note 21&#8212;Variable Interest Entities for additional information. 

##TABLE_END COMPONENTS OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO 

The loan portfolio is disaggregated into segments and then further disaggregated into classes for certain disclosures. GAAP defines a portfolio segment as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. A class is generally determined based on the initial measurement attribute (i.e., amortized cost or purchased credit-impaired), risk characteristics of the loan, and FHN&#8217;s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. Commercial loan portfolio segments include commercial, financial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) and commercial real estate ("CRE"). Commercial classes within C&#38;I include general C&#38;I, loans to mortgage companies, the trust preferred loans (&#8220;TRUPS&#8221;) (i.e. long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses) portfolio and purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans. Loans to mortgage companies include commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Commercial classes within CRE include income CRE, residential CRE and PCI loans. Consumer loan portfolio segments include consumer real estate, permanent mortgage, and the credit card and other portfolio. Consumer classes include home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;), real estate (&#8220;R/E&#8221;) installment and PCI loans within the consumer real estate segment, permanent mortgage (which is both a segment and a class), and credit card and other. 

Concentrations 

FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans ( 20 percent of total loans), the majority of which is in the consumer real estate segment ( 19 percent of total loans). Loans to finance and insurance companies total $ 2.8 billion ( 14 percent of the C&#38;I portfolio, or 9 percent of the total loans). FHN had loans to mortgage companies totaling $ 4.4 billion ( 22 percent of the C&#38;I segment, or 14 percent of total loans) as of December 31, 2019 . As a result, 36 percent of the C&#38;I segment is sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. 

Restrictions 

On December 31, 2019, $ 5.2 billion of commercial loans were pledged to secure potential discount window borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, FHN pledged all of its first and second lien mortgages, 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 145 

Note 4 &#8211; Loans (Continued) 

HELOCs, excluding restricted real estate loans, and commercial real estate loans to secure potential borrowings from the FHLB-Cincinnati. Restricted loans secured borrowings associated with consolidated VIEs. See Note 21 - Variable Interest Entities for additional discussion. 

Acquisition 

Generally, the fair value for acquired loans is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including adjustments for expected credit losses, prepayment speeds, current market rates for similar loans, and an adjustment for investor-required yield given product-type and various risk characteristics. 

At acquisition, FHN designated certain loans as PCI with the remaining loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, &#8220;Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs&#8221;. Of the loans designated as PCI at acquisition, $ 4.7 million is held-for-sale. For loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the difference between each loan&#8217;s book value and the estimated fair value at the time of the acquisition will be accreted into interest income over its remaining contractual life and the subsequent accounting and reporting will be similar to a loan in FHN&#8217;s originated portfolio. 

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

All discharged bankruptcy loans are charged down to an estimate of net realizable value and do not carry any allowance. 

##TABLE_END Asset Quality Indicators 

FHN employs a dual grade commercial risk grading methodology to assign an estimate for the probability of default (&#8220;PD&#8221;) and the loss given default (&#8220;LGD&#8221;) for each commercial loan using factors specific to various industry, portfolio, or product segments that result in a rank ordering of risk and the assignment of grades PD 1 to PD 16 . This credit grading system is intended to identify and measure the credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the migration of loans between grading categories. It is also integral to the estimation methodology utilized in determining the allowance for loan losses since an allowance is established for pools of commercial loans based on the credit grade assigned. Each PD grade corresponds to an estimated one-year default probability percentage; a PD 1 has the lowest expected default probability, and probabilities increase as grades progress down the scale. PD 1 through PD 12 are &#8220;pass&#8221; grades. PD grades 13 - 16 correspond to the regulatory-defined categories of special mention ( 13 ), substandard ( 14 ), doubtful ( 15 ), and loss ( 16 ). Pass loan grades are required to be reassessed annually or earlier whenever there has been a material change in the financial condition of the borrower or risk characteristics of the relationship. All commercial loans over $ 1 million and certain commercial loans over $ 500,000 that are graded 13 or worse are reassessed on a quarterly basis. Loan grading discipline is regularly reviewed internally by Credit Assurance Services to determine if the process continues to result in accurate loan grading across the portfolio. FHN may utilize availability of guarantors/sponsors to support lending decisions during the credit underwriting process and when determining the assignment of internal loan grades. LGD grades are assigned based on a scale of 1 - 12 and represent FHN&#8217;s expected recovery based on collateral type in the event a loan defaults. See Note 5 &#8211; Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion on the credit grading system.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

Balances presented net of a $ 20.2 million valuation allowance. In 3Q18, FHN sold $ 55.5 million of TRUPS loans with a $ 5.0 million valuation allowance. Upon sale, a gain of $ 3.8 million was recognized in the Non-Strategic segment within Fixed Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An additional TRUPS loan with a principal balance of $ 3.0 million and a valuation of $ .3 million was paid off in fourth quarter 2018. 

##TABLE_END 

The consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of smaller-balance loans which are very similar in nature in that most are standard products and are backed by residential real estate. Because of the similarities of consumer loan-types, FHN is able to utilize the Fair Isaac Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) score, among other attributes, to assess the credit quality of consumer borrowers. FICO scores are refreshed on a quarterly basis in an attempt to reflect the recent risk profile of the borrowers. Accruing delinquency amounts are indicators of asset quality within the credit card and other consumer portfolio. 

The following table reflects the percentage of balances outstanding by average, refreshed FICO scores for the HELOC, real estate installment, and permanent mortgage classes of loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Note 4 &#8211; Loans (Continued) 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when necessary to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. 

A modification is classified as a TDR if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and it is determined that FHN has granted a concession to the borrower. FHN may determine that a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt, or if it is probable that a borrower may default in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of a borrower&#8217;s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions could include extension of the maturity date, reductions of the interest rate (which may make the rate lower than current market for a new loan with similar risk), reduction or forgiveness of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing (or is likely to experience) financial difficulty, and whether a concession has been granted, are subjective in nature and management&#8217;s judgment is required when determining whether a modification is classified as a TDR. 

For all classes within the commercial portfolio segment, TDRs are typically modified through forbearance agreements (generally 6 to 12 months ). Forbearance agreements could include reduced interest rates, reduced payments, release of guarantor, or entering into short sale agreements. FHN&#8217;s proprietary modification programs for consumer loans are generally structured using parameters of U.S. government-sponsored programs such as the former Home Affordable Modification Program (&#8220;HAMP&#8221;). Within the HELOC and R/E installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment, TDRs are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 1 percent for up to 5 years ) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years , the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification; for certain modifications, the modified interest rate increases 2 percent per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved. Permanent mortgage TDRs are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 2 percent for up to 5 years ) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years , the interest rate steps up 1 percent every year until it reaches the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Weekly Survey Rate cap. Contractual maturities may be extended to 40 years on permanent mortgages and to 30 years for consumer real estate loans. Within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment, TDRs are typically modified through either a short-term credit card hardship program or a longer-term credit card workout program. In the credit card hardship program, borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for 6 months to 1 year . In the credit card workout program, customers are granted a rate reduction to 0 percent and term extensions for up to 5 years to pay off the remaining balance. 

Despite the absence of a loan modification, the discharge of personal liability through bankruptcy proceedings is considered a concession. As a result, FHN classifies all non-reaffirmed residential real estate loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as nonaccruing TDRs. 

On December 31, 2019 and 2018 , FHN had $ 206.3 million and $ 228.2 million of portfolio loans classified as TDRs, respectively. For TDRs in the loan portfolio, FHN had loan loss reserves of $ 19.7 million , or 10 percent as of December 31, 2019 , and $ 27.7 million , or 12 percent as of December 31, 2018 . Additionally, $ 51.1 million and $ 57.8 million of loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, were classified as TDRs.

Note 5 &#8211; Allowance for Loan Losses 

As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices, the ALLL includes the following components: reserves for commercial loans evaluated based on pools of credit graded loans and reserves for pools of smaller-balance homogeneous consumer loans, both determined in accordance with ASC 450-20-50, and to a lesser extent, reserves determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35 for loans determined by management to be individually impaired and an allowance associated with PCI loans. 

For commercial loans, ASC 450-20-50 reserves are established using historical net loss factors by grade level, loan product, and business segment. The ALLL for smaller-balance homogeneous consumer loans is determined based on pools of similar loan types that have similar credit risk characteristics. ASC 450-20-50 reserves for the consumer portfolio are determined using segmented roll-rate models that incorporate various factors including historical delinquency trends, experienced loss frequencies, and experienced loss severities. Generally, reserves for consumer loans reflect inherent losses in the portfolio that are expected to be recognized over the following twelve months. The historical net loss factors for both commercial and consumer ASC 450-20-50 reserve models are subject to qualitative adjustments by management to reflect current events, trends, and conditions (including economic considerations and trends), which are not fully captured in the historical net loss factors. The pace of the economic recovery, performance of the housing market, unemployment levels, labor participation rate, the regulatory environment, regulatory guidance, and portfolio segment-specific trends, are examples of additional factors considered by management in determining the ALLL. Additionally, management considers the inherent uncertainty of quantitative models that are driven by historical loss data. Management evaluates the periods of historical losses that are the basis for the loss rates used in the quantitative models and selects historical loss periods that are believed to be the most reflective of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Management also periodically reviews an analysis of the loss emergence period which is the amount of time it takes for a loss to be confirmed (initial charge-off) after a loss event has occurred. FHN performs extensive studies as it relates to the historical loss periods used in the model and the loss emergence period and model assumptions are adjusted accordingly. 

Impairment related to individually impaired loans is measured in accordance with ASC 310-10. For all commercial portfolio segments, commercial TDRs and other individually impaired commercial loans are measured based on the present value of expected future payments discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate (&#8220;the DCF method&#8221;), observable market prices, or for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell). Impaired loans also include consumer TDRs. Generally, the allowance for TDRs in all consumer portfolio segments is determined by estimating the expected future cash flows using the modified interest rate (if an interest rate concession), incorporating payoff and net charge-off rates specific to the TDRs within the portfolio segment being assessed, and discounted using the pre-modification interest rate. The discount rates of variable rate TDRs are adjusted to reflect changes in the interest rate index to which the rates are tied. The discounted cash flows are then compared to the outstanding principal balance in order to determine required reserves. Residential real estate loans discharged through bankruptcy are collateral-dependent and are charged down to net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell).

##TABLE_START a) 

In third quarter 2019, FHN corrected a previous mis-classification of commercial loans and reclassified approximately $ 410 million of market investor CRE loans from the C&#38;I portfolio to the CRE portfolio. These loans were identified during an internal review and assessment by management of certain loan populations, a portion of which relate to loans acquired as part of the Capital Bank merger. The reclassification of these loan balances between regional banking portfolios did not have an impact on FHN&#8217;s consolidated period-end or average balance sheet and had an immaterial effect on the allowance for loan losses. No adjustments were made to prior periods as the impact of the reclassification, including the effect on the allowance for loan losses was deemed to be immaterial in all periods.

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 163 

Note 10 &#8211; Term Borrowings (Continued) 

In conjunction with the acquisition of CBF, FHN acquired junior subordinated debentures with aggregate par values of $ 212.4 million . Each of these issuances is held by a wholly owned trust that has issued trust preferred securities to external investors and loaned the funds to FHN, as successor to CBF, as junior subordinated debt. The book value for each issuance represents the purchase accounting fair value as of the closing date less accumulated amortization of the associated discount, as applicable. Through various contractual arrangements FHN assumed a full and unconditional guarantee for each trust&#8217;s obligations with respect to the securities. While the maturity dates are typically 30 years from the original issuance date, FHN has the option to redeem each of the junior subordinated debentures at par on any future interest payment date, which would trigger redemption of the related trust preferred securities. The junior subordinated debentures are included in the Consolidated Statements of Condition in Term borrowings. A portion of FHN's junior subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital under the risk-based capital guidelines. FHN retired $ 45.4 million of this debt and the related trust preferred securities in 2018. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 164 

Note 11 &#8211; Preferred Stock 

FHN Preferred Stock 

On January 31, 2013, FHN issued 1,000 shares having an aggregate liquidation preference of $ 100 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A for net proceeds of approximately $ 96 million . Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of 6.20 percent per annum. For the issuance, FHN issued depositary shares, each of which represents a 1/4000th fractional ownership interest in a share of FHN&#8217;s preferred stock. These securities qualify as Tier 1 capital. 

Subsidiary Preferred Stock 

In 2000 FT Real Estate Securities Company, Inc. (&#8220;FTRESC&#8221;), an indirect subsidiary of FHN, issued 50 shares of 9.50 percent Cumulative Preferred Stock, Class B (&#8220;Class B Preferred Shares&#8221;), with a liquidation preference of $ 1.0 million per share; of those, 47 shares were issued to nonaffiliates. For all periods presented, these securities are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Condition as Term borrowings. FTRESC is a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) established for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and managing real estate mortgage assets. Dividends on the Class B Preferred Shares are cumulative and are payable semi-annually. 

The Class B Preferred Shares are mandatorily redeemable on March 31, 2031, and redeemable at the discretion of FTRESC in the event that the Class B Preferred Shares cannot be accounted for as Tier 2 regulatory capital or there is more than an insubstantial risk that dividends paid with respect to the Class B Preferred Shares will not be fully deductible for tax purposes. At December 31, 2019 the Class B Preferred Shares partially qualified as Tier 2 regulatory capital. They are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into any other securities of FTRESC, FHN, or any of its subsidiaries. In the event First Horizon Bank becomes undercapitalized, insolvent, or in danger of becoming undercapitalized, the shares are, however, automatically exchanged at the direction of the Federal banking regulators for preferred stock of First Horizon Bank, having substantially the same terms as the Class B Preferred Shares. 

Additionally for all periods presented, subsidiaries have also issued $ .6 million in aggregate of Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, which has been recognized as Noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statements of Condition and which partially qualifies as Tier 2 capital. Other preferred shares are outstanding but are owned by FHN subsidiaries and are eliminated in consolidation. 

In 2005 First Horizon Bank issued 300,000 shares of Class A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (&#8220;Class A Preferred Stock&#8221;) with a liquidation preference of $ 1,000 per share. Dividends on the Class A Preferred Stock, if declared, accrue and are payable each quarter, in arrears, at a floating rate equal to the greater of the three month LIBOR plus .85 percent or 3.75 percent per annum. These securities qualify fully as Tier 1 capital for First Horizon Bank while for FHN consolidated they qualify partially as Tier 1 capital and partially as Tier 2 capital. On December 31 , 2019 and 2018 , $ 294.8 million of Class A Preferred Stock was recognized as Noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statements of Condition.

Note 12 &#8211; Regulatory Capital and Restrictions 

Regulatory Capital. FHN and First Horizon Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on FHN&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain derivatives as calculated under regulatory accounting practices must be met. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators such as capital components, asset risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require FHN and First Horizon Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total, Tier 1, and Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (&#8220;Leverage&#8221;). Management believes that, as of December 31, 2019 , FHN and First Horizon Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. 

The actual capital amounts and ratios of FHN and First Horizon Bank are presented in the table below. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in thousands)

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 166 

Note 12 &#8211; Regulatory Capital and Restrictions (Continued) 

Restrictions on cash and due from banks. Under the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D, First Horizon Bank is required to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves. On December 31 , 2019 and 2018 , First Horizon Bank's net required reserves were $ 396.1 million and $ 371.7 million , respectively, after the consideration of $ 273.7 million in average vault cash. The remaining net reserve requirement for each year was met with Federal Reserve Bank deposits. Vault cash is reflected in Cash and due from banks on the Consolidated Statements of Condition and Federal Reserve Bank deposits are reflected as Interest-bearing cash. 

Restrictions on dividends. Cash dividends are paid by FHN from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its subsidiaries. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of First Horizon Bank to transfer funds to FHN in the form of cash, dividends, loans, or advances. As of December 31, 2019 , First Horizon Bank had undivided profits of $ 1.2 billion , of which a limited amount was available for distribution to FHN as dividends without prior regulatory approval. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of First Horizon Bank to transfer funds to FHN in the form of cash, dividends, loans, and advances. At any given time, the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow First Horizon Bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an amount equal to First Horizon Bank's retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year to date. For any period, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s &#8216;retained net income&#8217; generally is equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by First Horizon Bank. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $ 331.2 million at January 1, 2020 . First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $ 345.0 million in 2019 and $ 420.0 million in 2018. In January 2020, First Horizon Bank declared and paid a common dividend to the parent company in the amount of $ 65.0 million . During 2019 and 2018, First Horizon Bank declared and paid dividends on its preferred stock quarterly. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in first quarter 2020 payable in April 2020. 

The payment of cash dividends by FHN and First Horizon Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Beginning January 1, 2019, the ability to pay dividends for both FHN and First Horizon Bank is restricted if capital ratios fall below regulatory minimums for Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, Total Capital ratios plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer or 50 basis points above the capital ratios required to be considered well-capitalized. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. 

Restrictions on intercompany transactions. Under current Federal banking laws, First Horizon Bank may not enter into covered transactions with any affiliate including the parent company and certain financial subsidiaries in excess of 10 percent of the bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, as defined, or $ 426.0 million , on December 31, 2019 . Covered transactions include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or an investment in securities issued by an affiliate and the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for any loan or extension of credit. The equity investment, including retained earnings, in certain of a bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries is also treated as a covered transaction. On December 31, 2019, the parent company had covered transactions of $ .8 million from First Horizon Bank and two of the bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries, FHN Financial Securities Corp. and First Horizon Advisors, Inc., had covered transactions from First Horizon Bank totaling $ 390.4 million and $ 34.7 million , respectively. In addition, the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates, as defined, is limited to 20 percent of the bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, as defined, or $ 851.9 million , on December 31, 2019 . First Horizon Bank&#8217;s total covered transactions with all affiliates including the parent company on December 31, 2019 were $ 425.9 million .

##TABLE_END

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act &#8220;Tax Act&#8221; was signed into law at the end of 2017. The Tax Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. FHN recorded approximately $ 82 million of increase in tax expense related to the effects of the Tax Act during 2017 which was primarily related to an adjustment of DTA balances to the lower federal tax rate. In 2018, FHN recorded a tax benefit of $ 6.7 million related to the finalization of tax items for the 2017 tax return. 

A reconciliation of expected income tax expense/(benefit) at the federal statutory rate of 21 percent for 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 35 percent for 2017 to the total income tax expense follows:

##TABLE_END

A deferred tax asset (&#8220;DTA&#8221;) or deferred tax liability (&#8220;DTL&#8221;) is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. In order to support the recognition of the DTA, FHN&#8217;s management must believe that the realization of the DTA is more likely than not. FHN evaluates the likelihood of realization of the DTA based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time, including (as appropriate) scheduled reversals of DTLs, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards attributable to the DTA. In projecting future taxable income, FHN incorporates assumptions including the estimated amount of future state and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. 

As of December 31, 2019 , FHN's net DTA was $ 69.0 million compared to the $ 127.9 million at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019, FHN's gross DTA (net of a valuation allowance) and gross DTL were $ 250.6 million and $ 181.6 million , respectively. Although realization is not assured, FHN believes that it meets the more-likely-than-not requirement with respect to the net DTA after valuation allowance. 

Temporary differences which gave rise to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on December 31 , 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 171 

Note 15 &#8211; Income Taxes (Continued) 

The total unrecognized tax benefits (&#8220;UTB&#8221;) at December 31 , 2019 and 2018 , was $ 24.4 million and $ 20.2 million , respectively. To the extent such unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 are subsequently recognized, $ 18.4 million of tax benefits would impact tax expense and FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate in future periods. 

FHN is currently in audit in several jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the UTB related to federal and state exposures could decrease by $ 6.7 million and $ .5 million , respectively during 2020 if audits are completed and settled and if the applicable statutes of limitations expire as scheduled. 

FHN recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to UTB within income tax expense. FHN had approximately $ 2.9 million and $ 1.6 million accrued for the payment of interest as of December 31 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income during both 2019 and 2018 was an expense of $ 1.3 million .

Note 17 &#8211; Contingencies and Other Disclosures 

CONTINGENCIES 

Contingent Liabilities Overview 

Contingent liabilities arise in the ordinary course of business. Often they are related to lawsuits, arbitration, mediation, and other forms of litigation. Various litigation matters are threatened or pending against FHN and its subsidiaries. Also, FHN at times receives requests for information, subpoenas, or other inquiries from federal, state, and local regulators, from other government authorities, and from other parties concerning various matters relating to FHN&#8217;s current or former businesses. Certain matters of that sort are pending at this time, and FHN is cooperating in those matters. Pending and threatened litigation matters sometimes are settled by the parties, and sometimes pending matters are resolved in court or before an arbitrator. Regardless of the manner of resolution, frequently the most significant changes in status of a matter occur over a short time period, often following a lengthy period of little substantive activity. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, or where claims or other actions may be possible but have not been brought, FHN cannot reasonably determine what the eventual outcome of the matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters may be, or what the eventual loss or impact related to each matter may be. FHN establishes a loss contingency liability for a litigation matter when loss is both probable and reasonably estimable as prescribed by applicable financial accounting guidance. If loss for a matter is probable and a range of possible loss outcomes is the best estimate available, accounting guidance requires a liability to be established at the low end of the range. 

Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with counsel, management is of the opinion that loss contingencies related to threatened or pending litigation matters should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of FHN, but may be material to FHN&#8217;s operating results for any particular reporting period depending, in part, on the results from that period. 

Material Loss Contingency Matters 

Summary 

As used in this Note, except for matters that are reported as having been substantially settled or otherwise substantially resolved, FHN's &#8220;material loss contingency matters&#8221; generally fall into at least one of the following categories: (i) FHN has determined material loss to be probable and has established a material loss liability in accordance with applicable financial accounting guidance; (ii) FHN has determined material loss to be probable but is not reasonably able to estimate an amount or range of material loss liability; or (iii) FHN has determined that material loss is not probable but is reasonably possible, and that the amount or range of that reasonably possible material loss is estimable. As defined in applicable accounting guidance, loss is reasonably possible if there is more than a remote chance of a material loss outcome for FHN. Set forth below are disclosures for certain pending or threatened litigation matters, including all matters mentioned in (i) or (ii) and certain matters mentioned in (iii). In addition, certain other matters, or groups of matters, are discussed relating to FHN&#8217;s pre-2009 mortgage origination and servicing businesses. In all litigation matters discussed, unless settled or otherwise resolved, FHN believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue those defenses vigorously. 

FHN reassesses the liability for litigation matters each quarter as the matters progress. At December 31, 2019 , the aggregate amount of liabilities established for all such loss contingency matters was $ .7 million . These liabilities are separate from those discussed under the heading &#8220;Loan Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability&#8221; below. 

In each material loss contingency matter, except as otherwise noted, there is more than a remote chance that any of the following outcomes will occur: the plaintiff will substantially prevail; the defense will substantially prevail; the plaintiff will prevail in part; or the matter will be settled by the parties. At December 31, 2019, FHN is unable to estimate any material reasonably possible losses ("RPLs") for contingency matters in future periods in excess of currently established liabilities. 

As a result of the general uncertainties discussed above and the specific uncertainties discussed for each matter mentioned below, it is possible that the ultimate future loss experienced by FHN for any particular matter may materially exceed the amount, if any, of currently established liability for that matter.

Material Matters 

FHN was one of multiple defendants in a consolidated putative class action suit: In re GSE Bonds Antitrust Litigation, No. 1:19-cv-01704-JSR (U.S. District Court S.D.N.Y.). The plaintiffs claim that defendants conspired to fix secondary market prices of government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) bonds from 2009 through 2015. During the third quarter, FHN reached a class settlement with the plaintiffs, subject to court approval, without admitting liability. Though still subject to court approval, the settlement was paid before year-end and therefore is no longer reflected in established liabilities. 

On February 26, 2020, a former shareholder of Capital Bank Financial Corp. ("CBF") filed a putative class action suit, Searles v. DeMartini et al, No. 2020-0136 (Del. Chancery), against certain former directors, officers, and shareholders of CBF, alleging, among other things, that defendants breached certain fiduciary duties in connection with CBF's merger with FHN in 2017. Plaintiff claims unspecified damages related to the merger consideration and opportunity loss. FHN is unable to estimate an RPL range for this matter due to significant uncertainties regarding: whether a class will be certified and, if so, the composition of the class; the amount of potential damages that might be awarded, if any; of any such damages amount, the amount that FHN would be obliged to indemnify; the availability of applicable insurance; and the outcome of discovery, which has not yet begun. 

Exposures from pre-2009 Mortgage Business 

FHN is contending with indemnification claims related to "other whole loans sold," which were mortgage loans originated by FHN before 2009 and sold outside of an FHN securitization. These claims generally assert that FHN-originated loans contributed to losses in connection with mortgage loans securitized by the buyer of the loans. The claims generally do not include specific deficiencies for specific loans sold by FHN. Instead, the claims generally assert that FHN is liable for a share of the claimant's loss estimated by assessing the totality of the other whole loans sold by FHN to claimant in relation to the totality of the larger number of loans securitized by claimant. FHN is unable to estimate an RPL range for these matters due to significant uncertainties regarding: the number of, and the facts underlying, the loan originations which claimants assert are indemnifiable; the applicability of FHN&#8217;s contractual indemnity covenants to those facts and originations; and, in those cases where an indemnity claim may be supported, whether any legal defenses, counterclaims, other counter-positions, or third-party claims might eliminate or reduce claims against FHN or their impact on FHN. 

FHN also has indemnification claims related to servicing obligations. The most significant is from Nationstar Mortgage LLC, currently doing business as &#8220;Mr. Cooper.&#8221; Nationstar was the purchaser of FHN&#8217;s mortgage servicing obligations and assets in 2013 and 2014 and, starting in 2011, was FHN&#8217;s subservicer. Nationstar asserts several categories of indemnity obligations in connection with mortgage loans under the subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction. This matter currently is not in litigation, but litigation in the future is possible. FHN is unable to estimate an RPL range for this matter due to significant uncertainties regarding: the exact nature of each of Nationstar&#8217;s claims and its position in respect of each; the number of, and the facts underlying, the claimed instances of indemnifiable events; the applicability of FHN&#8217;s contractual indemnity covenants to those facts and events; and, in those cases where the facts and events might support an indemnity claim, whether any legal defenses, counterclaims, other counter-positions, or third-party claims might eliminate or reduce claims against FHN or their impact on FHN. 

FHN has additional potential exposures related to its pre-2009 mortgage businesses. A few of those matters have become litigation which FHN currently estimates are immaterial, some are non-litigation claims or threats, some are mere subpoenas or other requests for information, and in some areas FHN has no indication of any active or threatened dispute. Some of those matters might eventually result in settlements, and some might eventually result in adverse litigation outcomes, but none are included in the material loss contingency liabilities mentioned above or in the RPL range mentioned above. 

Mortgage Loan Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage businesses, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. 

Based on currently available information and experience to date, FHN has evaluated its loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure, and certain related exposures and has accrued for losses of $ 14.5 million and $ 32.3 million as of December 31, 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 175 

Note 17 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures (Continued) 

2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Accrued liabilities for FHN&#8217;s estimate of these obligations are reflected in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Charges/expense reversals to increase/decrease the liability are included within Repurchase and foreclosure provision/(provision credit) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimates are based upon currently available information and fact patterns that exist as of each balance sheet date and could be subject to future changes. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of FHN&#8217;s liability. 

OTHER DISCLOSURES 

Indemnification Agreements and Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, FHN enters into indemnification agreements for legal proceedings against its directors and officers and standard representations and warranties for underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, contractual commitments, and various other business transactions or arrangements. The extent of FHN&#8217;s obligations under these agreements depends upon the occurrence of future events; therefore, it is not possible to estimate a maximum potential amount of payouts that could be required by such agreements. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 176 

Note 18 &#8211; Pension, Savings, and Other Employee Benefits 

Pension plan. FHN sponsors a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan to employees hired or re-hired on or before September 1, 2007. Pension benefits are based on years of service, average compensation near retirement or other termination, and estimated social security benefits at age 65 . Benefits under the plan are &#8220;frozen&#8221; so that years of service and compensation changes after 2012 do not affect the benefit owed. Minimum contributions are based upon actuarially determined amounts necessary to fund the total benefit obligation. Decisions to contribute to the plan are based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. FHN made no contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2019 and 2017, and made an insignificant contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2018. Management does not currently anticipate that FHN will make a contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2020. 

FHN assumed two additional qualified pension plans in conjunction with the CBF acquisition. Both legacy CBF plans were frozen at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate benefit obligation for the plans was $ 17.1 million and aggregate plan assets were $ 16.5 million . Benefit payments, expense and actuarial gains/losses related to these plans were insignificant for the first half of 2019 and 2018. In third quarter 2019, FHN settled these plans through the purchase of annuity contracts, making related contributions of $ .5 million . Due to the insignificant financial statement impact, these two plans are not included in the disclosures that follow. 

FHN also maintains non-qualified plans including a supplemental retirement plan that covers certain employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan have been limited by tax rules. These other non-qualified plans are unfunded, and contributions to these plans cover all benefits paid under the non-qualified plans. Payments made under the non-qualified plans were $ 5.2 million for 2019. FHN anticipates making benefit payments under the non-qualified plans of $ 5.2 million in 2020. 

Savings plan. FHN provides all qualifying full-time employees with the opportunity to participate in FHN's tax qualifi ed 401(k) savings plan. The qualified plan allows employees to defer receipt of earned salary, up to tax law limits, on a tax- advantaged basis. Accounts, which are held in trust, may be invested in a wide range of mutual funds and in FHN common stock. Up to tax law limits, FHN provides a 100 percent match for the first 6 percent of salary deferred, with company matching contributions invested according to a participant&#8217;s current investment election. Through a non-qualified savings restoration plan, FHN provides a restorative benefit to certain highly-compensated employees who participate in the savings plan and whose contribution elections are capped by tax limitations. 

FHN also provides &#8220;flexible dollars&#8221; to assist employees with the cost of annual benefits and/or allow the employee to contribute to his or her qualified savings plan account. These &#8220;flexible dollars&#8221; are pre-tax contributions and are based upon the employees&#8217; years of service and qualified compensation. Contributions made by FHN through the flexible benefits plan and the company matches were $ 27.7 million for 2019, $ 29.3 million for 2018, and $ 23.0 million for 2017. 

Other employee benefits. FHN provides postretirement life insurance benefits to certain employees and also provides postretirement medical insurance benefits to retirement-eligible employees. The postretirement medical plan is contributory with FHN contributing a fixed amount for certain participants. FHN&#8217;s postretirement benefits include certain prescription drug benefits. 

Actuarial assumptions. FHN&#8217;s process for developing the long-term expected rate of return of pension plan assets is based on capital market exposure as the source of investment portfolio returns. Capital market exposure refers to the plan&#8217;s allocation of its assets to asset classes, which primarily represent fixed income investments. FHN also considers expectations for inflation, real interest rates, and various risk premiums based primarily on the historical risk premium for each asset class. The expected return is based upon a time horizon of thirty years . Given its funded status, the asset allocation strategy for the qualified pension plan utilizes fixed income instruments that closely match the estimated duration of payment obligations. Consequently, FHN selected a 4.80 percent assumption for 2019 for the qualified defined benefit pension plan and a .05 percent assumption for postretirement medical plan assets dedicated to employees who retired prior to January 1, 1993. FHN selected a 6.85 percent assumption for 2019 for postretirement medical plan assets dedicated to employees who retired after January 1, 1993. 

The discount rates for the three years ended 2019 for pension and other benefits were determined by using a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to thirty years . The discount rates are selected based upon data specific to FHN&#8217;s plans and employee population. The bonds used to create the hypothetical yield curve were subjected to several requirements to ensure that the resulting rates were representative of the bonds that would be selected by management to fulfill the company&#8217;s funding obligations. In addition to the AA rating, only non-callable bonds were included. Each bond issue was required to have at least $ 300 million par outstanding so that each issue was sufficiently 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 177 

Note 18 &#8211; Pension, Savings, and Other Employee Benefits (Continued) 

marketable. Finally, bonds more than two standard deviations from the average yield were removed. When selecting the discount rate, FHN matches the duration of high quality bonds with the duration of the obligations of the plan as of the measurement date. For all years presented, the measurement date of the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs was December 31. 

The actuarial assumptions used in the defined benefit pension plans and other employee benefit plans were as follows:

The rate of compensation increase previously had a significant effect on the actuarial assumptions used for the defined benefit pension plan. However, since the benefits in the pension plan are frozen, the rate of compensation increase has no effect upon qualified pension benefits. 

FHN has one pension plan where participants' benefits are affected by interest crediting rates. The plan's projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and interest crediting rates for the respective years are:

##TABLE_END

The long-term expected rate of return is applied to the market-related value of plan assets in determining the expected return on plan assets. FHN determines the market-related value of plan assets using a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over five years, as permitted by GAAP. 

FHN utilizes a spot rate approach which applies duration-specific rates from the full yield curve to estimated future benefit payments for the determination of interest cost. 

The following tables set forth the plans&#8217; benefit obligations and plan assets for 2019 and 2018 :

##TABLE_END

FHN utilizes the minimum amortization method in determining the amount of actuarial gains or losses to include in plan expense. Under this approach, the net deferred actuarial gain or loss that exceeds a threshold is amortized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. The threshold is measured as the greater of: 10 percent of a plan&#8217;s projected benefit obligation as of the beginning of the year or 10 percent of the market related value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year. FHN amortizes actuarial gains and losses using the estimated average remaining life expectancy of the remaining participants since all participants are considered inactive due to the freeze.

##TABLE_END

Plan assets. FHN&#8217;s overall investment goal is to create, over the life of the pension plan and retiree medical plan, an adequate pool of sufficiently liquid assets to support the qualified pension benefit obligations to participants, retirees, and beneficiaries, as well as to partially support the medical obligations to retirees and beneficiaries. Thus, the qualified pension plan and retiree medical plan seek to achieve a level of investment return consistent with changes in projected benefit obligations. 

Qualified pension plan assets primarily consist of fixed income securities which include U.S. treasuries, corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, municipal bonds, and foreign bonds. Fixed income investments generally have long durations consistent with the estimated pension liabilities of FHN. This duration-matching strategy is intended to hedge substantially all of the plan&#8217;s risk associated with future benefit payments. Retiree medical funds are kept in short-term investments, primarily money market funds and mutual funds. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, FHN did not have any significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets related to the pension plan or the retiree medical plan. 

The fair value of FHN&#8217;s pension plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , by asset category classified using the Fair Value measurement hierarchy is shown in the table below. See Note 24 &#8211; Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for more details about Fair Value measurements.

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 182 

Note 19 - Stock Options, Restricted Stock, and Dividend Reinvestment Plans 

Equity compensation plans 

FHN currently has one plan, its shareholder-approved Equity Compensation Plan (&#8220;ECP&#8221;), which authorizes the grant of new stock-based awards to employees and directors. Most awards outstanding at year end were granted under the ECP, though older stock options and certain deferred stock units remain outstanding under several plans which no longer are active. The ECP authorizes a broad range of award types, including restricted shares, stock units, and stock options. Stock units may be paid in shares or cash, depending upon the terms of the award. The ECP also authorizes the grant of stock appreciation rights, though no such grants have been made. Unvested awards have service and/or performance conditions which must be met in order for the shares to vest. Awards generally have service-vesting conditions, meaning that the employee must remain employed by FHN for certain periods in order for the award to vest. Some outstanding awards also have performance conditions, and one outstanding award has performance conditions associated with FHN&#8217;s stock price. FHN operates the ECP by establishing award programs, each of which is intended to cover a specific need. Programs are created, changed, or terminated as needs change. On December 31, 2019 , there were 6,350,062 shares available for new awards under the ECP. The ECP imposes a separate limit on full-value (non-option) awards which is included within the overall limit; at December 31, 2019 there were 4,961,854 shares available to be granted as full-value awards. 

Service condition full-value awards. Awards may be granted with service conditions only. In recent years, programs using these awards have included annual programs for executives and selected management employees, a mandatory deferral program for executives tied to annual bonuses earned, other mandatory or elective deferral programs, various retention programs, and special hiring-incentive situations. Details of the awards vary by program, but most are settled in shares at vesting rather than cash, and vesting rarely begins earlier than the first anniversary of grant and rarely extends beyond the fifth anniversary of grant. Annual programs tend to use multiple annual vesting dates while retention programs tend to use a single vesting date, but there are exceptions. 

Performance condition awards. Under FHN&#8217;s long-term incentive and corporate performance programs, performance stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) (executives) and cash units (selected management employees) are granted annually and vest only if predetermined performance measures are met. The measures are changed each year based on goals and circumstances prevailing at the time of grant. In recent years the performance periods have been three years , with service-vesting near the third anniversary of the grant. PSUs granted after 2014 also have a post-vest holding period of two years . Recent annual performance awards require pro-rated forfeiture for performance falling between a threshold level and a maximum. Performance awards sometimes are used to provide a narrow, targeted incentive to a single person or small group; one such award which includes a market performance condition to FHN&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) is discussed in the next paragraph. Of the annual program awards paid during 2019 or outstanding on December 31, 2019 : the 2015 units vested in 2018 and remain in a two year post-vesting holding period; performance conditions related to the 2016 units were met at the 104.2 percent payout level and vested in 2019 ; the three years performance period of the 2017 units has ended but performance is measured relative to peers and has not yet been determined; and, the three years performance periods for the 2018 and 2019 units have not ended. 

Market condition award. In 2016, FHN made a special grant of performance stock units to FHN&#8217;s CEO which will vest at the end of a performance period of seven years . The award has no provision for pro-rated payment based on partial performance. The award&#8217;s performance goal is based on achievement of a specific level of total shareholder return during the performance period. 

Director awards. Non-employee directors receive cash and annual grants of service-conditioned stock units under a program approved by the board of directors. Director stock units vest in the year following the year of grant, require a payment deferral of two years , and settle in shares after the deferral period. In 2019 and 2018 each director received $ 65,000 or prorated equivalent of stock units, representing a portion of their annual retainer. Prior to 2005 directors could elect to defer cash compensation in the form of discount-priced stock options, some of which remain outstanding.

The weighted average grant date fair value for shares/units granted in 2018 and 2017 was $ 18.70 and $ 18.83 , respectively. 

##TABLE_END On December 31, 2019 , there was $ 29.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years . The total grant date fair value of shares vested during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , was $ 14.6 million , $ 12.6 million , and $ 9.9 million , respectively. 

Stock option awards. Currently FHN operates only a single option program, calling for annual grants of service-vested options to executives. In the past, however, option programs varied widely in their uses and terms, and many old-program options, granted under the ECP or its predecessor plans, remain outstanding today. Except for substitute options (discussed below), all options granted since 2005 provide for the issuance of FHN common stock at a price fixed at its fair market value on the grant date. Except for substitute options, converted options and a special retention stock option award to the CEO in 2016, all options granted since 2008 vest fully no later than the fourth anniversary of grant, and all such options expire 7 years from the grant date. Substitute options can be issued under the ECP in exchange for options of an acquired company that are canceled in a merger. The price, vesting, expiration, and other terms of the substitute options economically mirror those of the canceled options. Converted options from CBF are all fully vested and expire ten years from grant date. The 2016 retention award vests beginning on the fourth anniversary of grant and extends through the sixth anniversary of grant. A deferral program, which was discontinued in 2005, allowed for foregone compensation plus the exercise price to equal the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant if the grantee agreed to receive the options in lieu of compensation. Deferral options still outstanding expire 20 years from the grant date.

FHN granted or converted 530,787 , 394,296 and 1,483,323 stock options with a weighted average fair value of $ 2.69 , $ 3.89 , and $ 4.69 per option at grant date in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 

FHN used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted or converted in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 with the following assumptions:

##TABLE_END

Expected lives of options granted are determined based on the vesting period, historical exercise patterns and contractual term of the options. FHN uses a blend of historical and implied volatility in determining expected volatility. A portion of the weighted average volatility rate is derived by compiling daily closing stock prices over a historical period approximating the expected lives of the options. Additionally, because of market volatility due to economic conditions and the impact on stock prices of financial institutions, FHN also incorporates a measure of implied volatility so as to incorporate more recent market conditions in the estimation of future volatility. 

Compensation Cost. The compensation cost that has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income pertaining to stock-based awards was $ 22.7 million , $ 23.2 million , and $ 20.6 million for 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The corresponding total income tax benefits recognized were $ 5.6 million in 2019 , $ 5.7 million in 2018 , and $ 7.9 million in 2017 . 

Authorization. Consistent with Tennessee state law, only authorized, but unissued, stock may be utilized in connection with any issuance of FHN common stock which may be required as a result of stock based compensation awards. FHN has obtained authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to certain numbers of shares related to issuance under the ECP and several older stock award plans. These authorizations are automatically adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Repurchases are authorized to be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be subject to market conditions, accumulation of excess equity, legal and regulatory restrictions, and prudent capital management. FHN does not currently expect to repurchase a material number of shares under the compensation plan-related repurchase program during 2020. 

Dividend reinvestment plan. The Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan authorizes the sale of FHN&#8217;s common stock from stock acquired on the open market to shareholders who choose to invest all or a portion of their cash dividends or make optional cash payments of $ 25 to $ 10,000 per quarter without paying commissions. The price of stock purchased on the open market is the average price paid.

Note 20 - Business Segment Information 

FHN has four business segments: regional banking, fixed income, corporate, and non-strategic. The regional banking segment offers financial products and services, including traditional lending and deposit taking, to consumer and commercial customers primarily in the southeast and other selected markets. Regional banking also provides investments, wealth management, financial planning, trust services and asset management, mortgage banking, credit card, and cash management. Additionally, the regional banking segment includes correspondent banking which provides credit, depository, and other banking related services to other financial institutions nationally. The fixed income segment consists of fixed income securities sales, trading, underwriting, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad, as well as loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales. The corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses, expense on subordinated debt issuances, bank-owned life insurance, unallocated interest income associated with excess equity, net impact of raising incremental capital, revenue and expense associated with deferred compensation plans, funds management, tax credit investment activities, derivative valuation adjustments related to prior sales of Visa Class B shares, gain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt, acquisition- and integration-related costs, expenses associated with rebranding initiatives, and various charges related to restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency efforts. The non-strategic segment consists of run-off consumer lending activities, pre-2009 mortgage banking elements, and the associated ancillary revenues and expenses related to these businesses. Non-strategic also includes the wind-down trust preferred loan portfolio and exited businesses. 

Periodically, FHN adapts its segments to reflect managerial or strategic changes. FHN may also modify its methodology of allocating expenses and equity among segments which could change historical segment results. Business segment revenue, expense, asset, and equity levels reflect those which are specifically identifiable or which are allocated based on an internal allocation method. Because the allocations are based on internally developed assignments and allocations, to an extent they are subjective. Generally, all assignments and allocations have been consistently applied for all periods presented. The following table reflects the amounts of consolidated revenue, expense, tax, and average assets, as well as, depreciation and amortization expense and expenditures for long lived assets for each segment for the years ended December 31:

Note 21 - Variable Interest Entities 

ASC 810 defines a VIE as a legal entity where (a) the equity investors, as a group, lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) the equity investors, as a group, lack either, (1) the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance, (2) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (3) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or (c) the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights. A variable interest is a contractual ownership or other interest that fluctuates with changes in the fair value of the VIE&#8217;s net assets exclusive of variable interests. Under ASC 810, as amended, a primary beneficiary is required to consolidate a VIE when it has a variable interest in a VIE that provides it with a controlling financial interest. For such purposes, the determination of whether a controlling financial interest exists is based on whether a single party has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. 

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 

During much of 2019, FHN held variable interests in a proprietary HELOC securitization trust it established as a source of liquidity for consumer lending operations. Based on its restrictive nature, the trust was considered a VIE as the holders of equity at risk did not have the power through voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the trust&#8217;s economic performance. The retention of mortgage service rights ("MSR") and a residual interest resulted in FHN potentially absorbing losses or receiving benefits that were significant to the trust. FHN was considered the primary beneficiary, as it was assumed to have the power, as Master Servicer, to most significantly impact the activities of the VIE. Consolidation of the trust resulted in the recognition of the trust proceeds as restricted borrowings since the cash flows on the securitized loans could only be used to settle the obligations due to the holders of trust securities. Through first quarter 2016 the trust experienced a rapid amortization period and FHN was obligated to provide subordinated funding. During the period, cash payments from borrowers were accumulated to repay outstanding debt securities while FHN continued to make advances to borrowers when they drew on their lines of credit. FHN then transferred the newly generated receivables into the securitization trust. FHN was reimbursed for these advances only after other parties in the securitization had received all of the cash flows to which they were entitled. Amounts funded from monoline insurance policies were considered restricted term borrowings in FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition. Except for recourse due to breaches of representations and warranties made by FHN in connection with the sale of the loans to the trust, the creditors of the trust held no recourse to the assets of FHN. This securitization was resolved in fourth quarter 2019. 

FHN has established certain rabbi trusts related to deferred compensation plans offered to its employees. FHN contributes employee cash compensation deferrals to the trusts and directs the underlying investments made by the trusts. The assets of these trusts are available to FHN&#8217;s creditors only in the event that FHN becomes insolvent. These trusts are considered VIEs as there is no equity at risk in the trusts since FHN provided the equity interest to its employees in exchange for services rendered. FHN is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trusts as it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the rabbi trusts through its ability to direct the underlying investments made by the trusts. Additionally, FHN could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the trusts due to its right to receive any asset values in excess of liability payoffs and its obligation to fund any liabilities to employees that are in excess of a rabbi trust&#8217;s assets.

Low Income Housing Partnerships. First Horizon Community Investment Group, Inc. ("FHCIG") (formerly First Tennessee Housing Corporation (&#8220;FTHC&#8221;)), a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Horizon Bank (formerly First Tennessee Bank National Association ("FTBNA"), makes equity investments as a limited partner in various partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (&#8220;LIHTC&#8221;) pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to support FHN&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives. The activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing units that are leased to qualifying residential tenants generally within FHN&#8217;s primary geographic region. LIHTC partnerships are considered VIEs as FHCIG, the holder of the equity investment at risk, does not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of the entity through voting rights or similar rights. FHCIG could absorb losses that are significant to the LIHTC partnerships as it has a risk of loss for its capital contributions and funding commitments to each partnership. The general partners are considered the primary beneficiaries as managerial functions give them the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance and the managing members are exposed to all losses beyond FHCIG&#8217;s initial capital contributions and funding commitments. 

FHN accounts for all qualifying LIHTC investments under the proportional amortization method. Under this method an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense/(benefit). LIHTC investments that do not qualify for the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Expenses associated with these investments were $ 1.3 million , $ 4.1 million , and $ 1.8 million during 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The following table summarizes the impact to the Provision/(benefit) for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 for LIHTC investments accounted for under the proportional amortization method.

Note 21 - Variable Interest Entities (Continued) 

Other Tax Credit Investments. First Tennessee New Markets Corporation (&#8220;FTNMC&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Horizon Bank, periodically makes equity investments through wholly-owned subsidiaries as a non-managing member in various limited liability companies (&#8220;LLCs&#8221;) that sponsor community development projects utilizing the New Market Tax Credit (&#8220;NMTC&#8221;) pursuant to Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to support FHN&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives. The activities of the LLCs include providing investment capital for low-income communities within FHN&#8217;s primary geographic region. A portion of the funding of FTNMC&#8217;s investment in a NMTC LLC is obtained via a loan from an unrelated third-party that is typically a community development enterprise. The NMTC LLCs are considered VIEs as FTNMC, the holder of the equity investment at risk, does not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of the entity through voting rights or similar rights. While FTNMC could absorb losses that are significant to the NMTC LLCs as it has a risk of loss for its initial capital contributions, the managing members are considered the primary beneficiaries as managerial functions give them the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the NMTC LLCs&#8217; economic performance and the managing members are exposed to all losses beyond FTNMC&#8217;s initial capital contributions. A NMTC relationship was resolved in 2019 resulting in a $ 2.7 million decline in the related debt. 

FHCIG also makes equity investments as a limited partner or non-managing member in entities that receive Historic Tax Credits pursuant to Section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2019, there were no remaining investments. The purpose of these entities is the rehabilitation of historic buildings with the tax credits provided to incent private investment in the historic cores of cities and towns. These entities are considered VIEs as FHCIG, the holder of the equity investment at risk, does not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of the entity through voting rights or similar rights. FHCIG could absorb losses that are significant to the entities as it has a risk of loss for its capital contributions and funding commitments to each partnership. The managing members are considered the primary beneficiaries as managerial functions give them the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance and the managing members are exposed to all losses beyond FHCIG&#8217;s initial capital contributions and funding commitments. 

Small Issuer Trust Preferred Holdings . First Horizon Bank holds variable interests in trusts which have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (&#8220;trust preferreds&#8221;) for smaller banking and insurance enterprises. First Horizon Bank has no voting rights for the trusts&#8217; activities. The trusts&#8217; only assets are junior subordinated debentures of the issuing enterprises. The creditors of the trusts hold no recourse to the assets of First Horizon Bank. These trusts meet the definition of a VIE as the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts&#8217; economic performance. Based on the nature of the trusts&#8217; activities and the size of First Horizon Bank&#8217;s holdings, First Horizon Bank could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the trusts regardless of whether a majority of a trust&#8217;s securities are held by First Horizon Bank. However, since First Horizon Bank is solely a holder of the trusts&#8217; securities, it has no rights which would give it the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts&#8217; economic performance and thus it is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. 

On-Balance Sheet Trust Preferred Securitization. In 2007, First Horizon Bank executed a securitization of certain small issuer trust preferreds for which the underlying trust meets the definition of a VIE as the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance. First Horizon Bank could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the trust based on the size and priority of the interests it retained in the securities issued by the trust. However, since First Horizon Bank did not retain servicing or other decision making rights, First Horizon Bank is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust&#8217;s economic performance. Accordingly, First Horizon Bank has accounted for the funds received through the securitization as a term borrowing in its Consolidated Statements of Condition. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trust. 

Proprietary Residential Mortgage Securitizations. FHN holds variable interests (primarily principal-only strips) in proprietary residential mortgage securitization trusts it established prior to 2008 as a source of liquidity for its mortgage banking operations. Except for recourse due to breaches of representations and warranties made by FHN in connection with the sale of the loans to the trusts, the creditors of the trusts hold no recourse to the assets of FHN. Additionally, FHN has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. Based on their restrictive nature, the trusts are considered VIEs as the holders of equity at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts&#8217; economic performance. However, FHN did not have the ability to participate in significant portions of a securitization trust&#8217;s cash flows and FHN was not considered the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, these trusts were not consolidated by FHN. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 191 

Note 21 - Variable Interest Entities (Continued) 

Holdings in Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities. FHN holds securities issued by various Agency securitization trusts. Based on their restrictive nature, the trusts meet the definition of a VIE since the holders of the equity investments at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance. FHN could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the trusts based on the nature of the trusts&#8217; activities and the size of FHN&#8217;s holdings. However, FHN is solely a holder of the trusts&#8217; securities and does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts&#8217; economic performance, and is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. FHN has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. 

Commercial Loan Troubled Debt Restructurings. For certain troubled commercial loans, First Horizon Bank restructures the terms of the borrower&#8217;s debt in an effort to increase the probability of receipt of amounts contractually due. Following a troubled debt restructuring, the borrower entity typically meets the definition of a VIE as the initial determination of whether an entity is a VIE must be reconsidered as events have proven that the entity&#8217;s equity is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or a restructuring of the terms of its financing. As First Horizon Bank does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such troubled commercial borrowers&#8217; operations, it is not considered the primary beneficiary even in situations where, based on the size of the financing provided, First Horizon Bank is exposed to potentially significant benefits and losses of the borrowing entity. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the borrowing entities beyond certain funding commitments established upon restructuring of the terms of the debt that allows for preparation of the underlying collateral for sale. 

Sale Leaseback Transaction . First Horizon Bank has entered into an agreement with a single asset leasing entity for the sale and leaseback of an office building. In conjunction with this transaction, First Horizon Bank loaned funds to a related party of the buyer that were used for the purchase price of the building. First Horizon Bank also entered into a construction loan agreement with the single asset entity for renovation of the building. Since this transaction did not qualify as a sale prior to 2019, it was accounted for using the deposit method which created a net asset or liability for all cash flows between First Horizon Bank and the buyer. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 the transaction qualified as a seller-financed sale-leaseback. The buyer-lessor in this transaction meets the definition of a VIE as it does not have sufficient equity at risk since First Horizon Bank is providing the funding for the purchase and renovation. A related party of the buyer-lessor has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the operations and could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the transactions, making it the primary beneficiary. Therefore, First Horizon Bank does not consolidate the leasing entity. 

Proprietary Trust Preferred Issuances . In conjunction with the acquisition of CBF, FHN acquired junior subordinated debt underlying multiple issuances of trust preferred debt by institutions previously acquired by CBF. All of the remaining trusts are considered VIEs because the ownership interests from the capital contributions to these trusts are not considered &#8220;at risk&#8221; in evaluating whether the holders of the equity investments at risk in the trusts have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance. Thus, FHN cannot be the trusts&#8217; primary beneficiary because its ownership interests in the trusts are not considered variable interests as they are not considered &#8220;at risk&#8221;. Consequently, none of the trusts are consolidated by FHN.

Note 22 - Derivatives 

In the normal course of business, FHN utilizes various financial instruments (including derivative contracts and credit-related agreements) through its fixed income and risk management operations, as part of its risk management strategy and as a means to meet customers&#8217; needs. Derivative instruments are subject to credit and market risks in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet as required by GAAP. The contractual or notional amounts of these financial instruments do not necessarily represent the amount of credit or market risk. However, they can be used to measure the extent of involvement in various types of financial instruments. Controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated. The Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) controls, coordinates, and monitors the usage and effectiveness of these financial instruments. 

Credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur if a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. The measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value. FHN manages credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions through national exchanges, primary dealers or approved counterparties, and by using mutual margining and master netting agreements whenever possible to limit potential exposure. FHN also maintains collateral posting requirements with certain counterparties to limit credit risk. Daily margin posted or received with 

central clearinghouses is considered a legal settlement of the related derivative contracts which results in a net presentation for 

each contract in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Treatment of daily margin as a settlement has no effect 

on hedge accounting or gains/losses for the applicable derivative contracts. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, $ 136.6 million and $ 76.0 million of cash receivables and $ 53.0 million and $ 34.0 million of cash payables related to collateral posting under master netting arrangements, inclusive of collateral posted related to contracts with adjustable collateral posting thresholds and over-collateralized positions, with derivative counterparties. With exchange-traded contracts, the credit risk is limited to the clearinghouse used. For non-exchange traded instruments, credit risk may occur when there is a gain in the fair value of the financial instrument and the counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of the contract and/or when the collateral proves to be of insufficient value. See additional discussion regarding master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements later in this note under the heading &#8220;Master Netting and Similar Agreements.&#8221; Market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in interest rates or the prices of debt instruments. FHN manages market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. FHN continually measures this risk through the use of models that measure value-at-risk and earnings-at-risk. 

Derivative Instruments. FHN enters into various derivative contracts both to facilitate customer transactions and as a risk management tool. Where contracts have been created for customers, FHN enters into upstream transactions with dealers to offset its risk exposure. Contracts with dealers that require central clearing are novated to a clearing agent who becomes FHN&#8217;s counterparty. Derivatives are also used as a risk management tool to hedge FHN&#8217;s exposure to changes in interest rates or other defined market risks. 

Forward contracts are over-the-counter contracts where two parties agree to purchase and sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument at a specified price, with delivery or settlement at a specified date. Futures contracts are exchange-traded contracts where two parties agree to purchase and sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument at a specified price, with delivery or settlement at a specified date. Interest rate option contracts give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified quantity of a financial instrument, at a specified price, during a specified period of time. Caps and floors are options that are linked to a notional principal amount and an underlying indexed interest rate. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest payments at specified intervals between two parties without the exchange of any underlying principal. Swaptions are options on interest rate swaps that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a specified period of time. 

Trading Activities 

FHN&#8217;s fixed income segment trades U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, government-guaranteed loan, mortgage-backed, corporate and municipal fixed income securities, and other securities for distribution to customers. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts. Fixed income also enters into interest rate contracts, including caps, swaps, and floors, for its customers. In addition, fixed income enters into futures and option contracts to economically hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of its securities inventory. These transactions are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in fixed income noninterest income. Related assets and liabilities are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Condition as Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities. The FHN Financial Risk Committee and the Credit Risk Management Committee collaborate to mitigate credit risk related to these transactions. Credit risk is controlled through credit

Interest Rate Risk Management 

FHN&#8217;s ALCO focuses on managing market risk by controlling and limiting earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk exists to the extent that interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have different maturity or repricing characteristics. FHN uses derivatives, primarily swaps, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Interest paid or received for swaps utilized by FHN to hedge the fair value of long term debt is recognized as an adjustment of the interest expense of the liabilities whose risk is being managed. FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk management policy is to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk or market value of assets or liabilities, not to speculate. In addition, FHN has entered into certain interest rate swaps and caps as a part of a product offering to commercial customers that includes customer derivatives paired with upstream offsetting market instruments that, when completed, are designed to mitigate interest rate risk. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are measured at fair value with gains or losses included in current earnings in Noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

FHN designated a derivative transaction in a hedging strategy to manage interest rate risk on $ 400.0 million of senior debt issued by First Horizon Bank prior to its maturity December 2019. This qualified for hedge accounting under ASC 815-20 using the long-haul method. FHN entered into a pay floating, receive fixed interest rate swap to hedge the interest rate risk of the senior debt. First Horizon bank early redeemed the $ 400.0 million senior debt on November 1, 2019. 

FHN has designated a derivative transaction in a hedging strategy to manage interest rate risk on $ 500.0 million of senior debt which matures in December 2020. This qualifies for hedge accounting under ASC 815-20 using the long-haul method. FHN entered into a pay floating, receive fixed interest rate swap to hedge the interest rate risk of the senior debt.

##TABLE_END In first quarter 2016, FHN entered into a pay floating, receive fixed interest rate swap in a hedging strategy to manage its exposure to the variability in cash flows related to the interest payments for the following five years on $ 250 million principal of debt instruments, which primarily consist of held-to-maturity trust preferred loans that have variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR. In first quarter 2017, FHN initiated cash flow hedges of $ 650 million notional amount that had initial durations between three years and seven years . The debt instruments primarily consist of held-to-maturity commercial loans that have variable interest payments based on 1-month LIBOR. These qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under ASC 815-20. Subsequent to 2017, all changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as a component of AOCI. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the hedged cash flows affect earnings. Prior to 2018, FHN measured ineffectiveness using the Hypothetical Derivative Method and AOCI was adjusted to an amount that reflected the lesser of either the cumulative change in fair value of the swaps or the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative instruments. To the extent that any ineffectiveness existed in the hedge relationships, the amounts were recorded in current period earnings. Interest paid or received for these swaps is recognized as an adjustment to interest income of the assets whose cash flows are being hedged.

In conjunction with the sales of a portion of its Visa Class B shares in 2010 and 2011, FHN and the purchaser entered into derivative transactions whereby FHN will make or receive cash payments whenever the conversion ratio of the Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is adjusted. FHN is also required to make periodic financing payments to the purchasers until all of Visa's covered litigation matters are resolved. In third quarter 2018, FHN sold the remainder of its Visa Class B shares, entering into a similar derivative arrangement with the counterparty. All of these derivatives extend until the end of Visa&#8217;s Covered Litigation matters. In September 2018, Visa reached a preliminary settlement for one class of plaintiffs in its Payment Card Interchange matter, which later received final court approval in December 2019. In accordance with the agreement terms, several individual plaintiffs opted out of the settlement and have the opportunity to separately pursue resolution with Visa. Settlement has not been reached with the second class of plaintiffs in this matter and other covered litigation matters are also pending judicial resolution. Accordingly, the value and timing for completion of Visa&#8217;s Covered Litigation matters are uncertain. 

The derivative transaction executed in third quarter 2018 includes a contingent accelerated termination clause based on the credit ratings of FHN and First Horizon Bank. FHN has not received or paid collateral related to this contract. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the derivative liabilities associated with the sales of Visa Class B shares were $ 22.8 million and $ 31.5 million , respectively. See Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets &#38; Liabilities for discussion of the valuation inputs and processes for these Visa-related derivatives. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 198 

Note 22 - Derivatives (Continued) 

FHN utilizes cross currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated loans. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, these loans were valued at $ 18.4 million and $ 11.0 million , respectively. The balance sheet amount and the gains/losses associated with these derivatives were not significant. 

Master Netting and Similar Agreements 

As previously discussed, FHN uses master netting agreements, mutual margining agreements and collateral posting requirements to minimize credit risk on derivative contracts. Master netting and similar agreements are used when counterparties have multiple derivatives contracts that allow for a &#8220;right of setoff,&#8221; meaning that a counterparty may net offsetting positions and collateral with the same counterparty under the contract to determine a net receivable or payable. The following discussion provides an overview of these arrangements which may vary due to the derivative type and market in which a derivative transaction is executed. 

Interest rate derivatives are subject to agreements consistent with standard agreement forms of the International Swap and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;). Currently, all interest rate derivative contracts are entered into as over-the-counter transactions and collateral posting requirements are based on the net asset or liability position with each respective counterparty. For contracts that require central clearing, novation to a counterparty with access to a clearinghouse occurs and margin is posted. Cash margin received (posted) that is considered settlements for the derivative contracts is included in the respective derivative asset (liability) value. Cash margin that is considered collateral received (posted) for interest rate derivatives is recognized as a liability (asset) on FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Interest rate derivatives with customers that are smaller financial institutions typically require posting of collateral by the counterparty to FHN. This collateral is subject to a threshold with daily adjustments based upon changes in the level or fair value of the derivative position. Positions and related collateral can be netted in the event of default. Collateral pledged by a counterparty is typically cash or securities. The securities pledged as collateral are not recognized within FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition. Interest rate derivatives associated with lending arrangements share the collateral with the related loan(s). The derivative and loan positions may be netted in the event of default. For disclosure purposes, the entire collateral amount is allocated to the loan. 

Interest rate derivatives with larger financial institutions entered into prior to required central clearing typically contain provisions whereby the collateral posting thresholds under the agreements adjust based on the credit ratings of both counterparties. If the credit rating of FHN and/or First Horizon Bank is lowered, FHN could be required to post additional collateral with the counterparties. Conversely, if the credit rating of FHN and/or First Horizon Bank is increased, FHN could have collateral released and be required to post less collateral in the future. Also, if a counterparty&#8217;s credit ratings were to decrease, FHN and/or First Horizon Bank could require the posting of additional collateral; whereas if a counterparty&#8217;s credit ratings were to increase, the counterparty could require the release of excess collateral. Collateral for these arrangements is adjusted daily based on changes in the net fair value position with each counterparty. 

The net fair value, determined by individual counterparty, of all derivative instruments with adjustable collateral posting thresholds was $ 63.1 million of assets and $ 6.4 million of liabilities on December 31, 2019 , and $ 15.0 million of assets and $ 34.9 million of liabilities on December 31, 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, FHN had received collateral of $ 148.5 million and $ 80.2 million and posted collateral of $ 18.4 million and $ 13.3 million , respectively, in the normal course of business related to these agreements. 

Certain agreements entered into prior to required central clearing also contain accelerated termination provisions, inclusive of the right of offset, if a counterparty&#8217;s credit rating falls below a specified level. If a counterparty&#8217;s debt rating (including FHN&#8217;s and First Horizon Bank's) were to fall below these minimums, these provisions would be triggered, and the counterparties could terminate the agreements and require immediate settlement of all derivative contracts under the agreements. The net fair value, determined by individual counterparty, of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent accelerated termination provisions was $ 63.1 million of assets and $ 10.3 million of liabilities on December 31, 2019 , and $ 19.0 million of assets and $ 33.2 million of liabilities on December 31, 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, FHN had received collateral of $ 148.5 million and $ 84.5 million and posted collateral of $ 22.7 million and $ 15.2 million , respectively, in the normal course of business related to these contracts. 

FHN&#8217;s fixed income segment buys and sells various types of securities for its customers. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts, and are generally not subject to master netting agreements. For futures and

Note 22 - Derivatives (Continued) 

options, FHN transacts through a third party, and the transactions are subject to margin and collateral maintenance requirements. In the event of default, open positions can be offset along with the associated collateral. 

For this disclosure, FHN considers the impact of master netting and other similar agreements which allow FHN to settle all contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative asset or liability position with the related securities and cash collateral. The application of the collateral cannot reduce the net derivative asset or liability position below zero, and therefore any excess collateral is not reflected in the following tables. 

The following table provides details of derivative assets and collateral received as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:

Note 23 - Master Netting and Similar Agreements - Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, and Securities Borrowing Transactions 

For repurchase, reverse repurchase and securities borrowing transactions, FHN and each counterparty have the ability to offset all open positions and related collateral in the event of default. Due to the nature of these transactions, the value of the collateral for each transaction approximates the value of the corresponding receivable or payable. For repurchase agreements through FHN&#8217;s fixed income business (Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase), transactions are collateralized by securities and/or government guaranteed loans which are delivered on the settlement date and are maintained throughout the term of the transaction. For FHN&#8217;s repurchase agreements through banking activities (Securities sold under agreements to repurchase), securities are typically pledged at settlement and not released until maturity. For asset positions, the collateral is not included on FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition. For liability positions, securities collateral pledged by FHN is generally represented within FHN&#8217;s trading or available-for-sale securities portfolios. 

For this disclosure, FHN considers the impact of master netting and other similar agreements that allow FHN to settle all contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net asset or liability position with the related securities collateral. The application of the collateral cannot reduce the net asset or liability position below zero, and therefore any excess collateral is not reflected in the tables below.

Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 

FHN groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. This hierarchy requires FHN to maximize the use of observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Each fair value measurement is placed into the proper level based on the lowest level of significant input. These levels are: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1&#8212;Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2&#8212;Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3&#8212;Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect management&#8217;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities (Continued) 

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

From time to time, FHN may be required to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or market (&#8220;LOCOM&#8221;) accounting or write-downs of individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis which were still held on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, the following tables provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment, the related carrying value, and the fair value adjustments recorded during the respective periods.

Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities (Continued) 

In 2019, FHN recognized $ 4.6 million of impairments and $ .7 million of impairment reversals, respectively, related to dispositions of acquired properties and $ 1.5 million of impairments for lease assets related to continuing acquisition integration efforts associated with reduction of leased office space and branch optimization. Related to its restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency efforts, FHN recognized $ 14.0 million of impairments and $ 1.4 million of impairment reversals, respectively, for tangible long-lived assets and lease assets. Related to the Company's rebranding initiative, FHN recognized $ 7.1 million of impairments within the Corporate segment for long-lived tangible assets, primarily signage, related to the company's rebranding initiative. These amounts were recognized in the Corporate segment. 

In 2018, FHN recognized $ 3.9 million of impairments of long-lived assets in its Corporate segment primarily related to optimization efforts for its facilities. Also, in 2018, $ 1.5 million of impairment charges previously recognized in 2017 in the Corporate segment were reversed based on the disposition prices for the applicable locations. 

In 2017, FHN recognized $ 3.0 million and $ .8 million of impairments on long-lived assets in its corporate and regional banking segments, respectively, associated with efforts to more efficiently utilize its branch locations, including integration with branches acquired from CBF. 

Lease asset impairments recognized in 2019 represent the reduction in value of the right-of-use assets associated with leases that are being exited in advance of the contractual lease expiration. Impairments are measured using a discounted cash flow methodology, which is considered a Level 3 valuation. 

For all periods, impairments of long-lived tangible assets reflect locations where the associated land and building are either owned or leased. The fair values of owned sites were determined using estimated sales prices from appraisals and broker opinions less estimated costs to sell with adjustments upon final disposition. The fair values of owned assets in leased sites (e.g., leasehold improvements) were determined using a discounted cash flow approach, based on the revised estimated useful lives of the related assets. Both measurement methodologies are considered Level 3 valuations. Impairment adjustments recognized upon disposition of a location are considered Level 2 valuations.

##TABLE_END Securities AFS . Increases (decreases) in estimated prepayment rates and bond equivalent yields negatively (positively) affect the value of SBA interest only strips. Management additionally considers whether the loans underlying related SBA-interest only strips are delinquent, in default or prepaying, and adjusts the fair value down 20 - 100% depending on the length of time in default. 

Loans held-for-sale. Foreclosure losses and prepayment rates are significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of FHN&#8217;s residential real estate loans held-for-sale. Loss severity trends are also assessed to evaluate the reasonableness of fair value estimates resulting from discounted cash flows methodologies as well as to estimate fair value for newly repurchased loans and loans that are near foreclosure. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements. All observable and unobservable inputs are re-assessed quarterly. 

Increases (decreases) in estimated prepayment rates and bond equivalent yields negatively (positively) affect the value of unguaranteed interests in SBA loans. Unguaranteed interest in SBA loans held-for-sale are carried at less than the outstanding balance due to credit risk estimates. Credit risk adjustments may be reduced if prepayment is likely or as consistent payment

FHN uses a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of FHN&#8217;s derivative liabilities associated with its prior sales of Visa Class B shares. The methodology includes estimation of both the resolution amount for Visa&#8217;s Covered Litigation matters as well as the length of time until the resolution occurs. Significant increases (decreases) in either of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair value measurements for the derivative liabilities. Additionally, FHN performs a probability weighted multiple resolution scenario to calculate the estimated fair value of these derivative liabilities. Assignment of higher (lower) probabilities to the larger potential resolution scenarios would result in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities. Since this estimation process requires application of judgment in developing significant unobservable inputs used to determine the possible outcomes and the probability weighting assigned to each scenario, these derivatives have been classified within Level 3 in fair value measurements disclosures. 

Loans, net of unearned income and Other Real Estate Owned. Collateral-dependent loans and OREO are primarily valued using appraisals based on sales of comparable properties in the same or similar markets. Other collateral (receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is valued through borrowing base certificates, financial statements and/or auction valuations. These valuations are discounted based on the quality of reporting, knowledge of the marketability/collectability of the collateral and historical disposition rates. 

Other assets &#8211; tax credit investments. The estimated fair value of tax credit investments accounted for under the equity method is generally determined in relation to the yield (i.e., future tax credits to be received) an acquirer of these investments would expect in relation to the yields experienced on current new issue and/or secondary market transactions. Thus, as tax credits are recognized, the future yield to a market participant is reduced, resulting in consistent impairment of the individual investments. Individual investments are reviewed for impairment quarterly, which may include the consideration of additional marketability discounts related to specific investments which typically includes consideration of the underlying property&#8217;s appraised value. 

Fair Value Option 

FHN has elected the fair value option on a prospective basis for almost all types of mortgage loans originated for sale purposes under the Financial Instruments Topic (&#8220;ASC 825&#8221;) except for mortgage origination operations which utilize the platform acquired from CBF. FHN determined that the election reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of such loans with changes in the value of derivatives and forward delivery commitments used as economic hedges for these assets at the time of election. 

Repurchased loans are recognized within loans held-for-sale at fair value at the time of repurchase, which includes consideration of the credit status of the loans and the estimated liquidation value. FHN has elected to continue recognition of these loans at fair value in periods subsequent to reacquisition. Due to the credit-distressed nature of the vast majority of repurchased loans and the related loss severities experienced upon repurchase, FHN believes that the fair value election provides a more timely recognition of changes in value for these loans that occur subsequent to repurchase. Absent the fair value election, these loans would be subject to valuation at the LOCOM value, which would prevent subsequent values from exceeding the initial fair value, determined at the time of repurchase, but would require recognition of subsequent declines in value. Thus, the fair value election provides for a more timely recognition of any potential future recoveries in asset values while not affecting the requirement to recognize subsequent declines in value.

##TABLE_END

For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the amounts for residential real estate loans held-for-sale included gains of $ .4 million , $ .2 million , and $ .5 million , respectively, in pretax earnings that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. The portion of the fair value adjustments related to credit risk was determined based on estimated default rates and estimated loss severities. Interest income on residential real estate loans held-for-sale measured at fair value is calculated based on the note rate of the loan and is recorded in the interest income section of the Consolidated Statements of Income as interest on loans held-for-sale. 

FHN has elected to account for retained interest-only strips from guaranteed SBA loans recorded in available-for-sale securities at fair value through earnings. Since these securities are subject to the risk that prepayments may result in FHN not recovering all or a portion of its recorded investment, the fair value election results in a more timely recognition of the effects of estimated prepayments through earnings rather than being recognized through other comprehensive income with periodic review for other-than-temporary impairment. Gains or losses are recognized through fixed income revenues and are presented in the recurring measurements table. 

Determination of Fair Value 

In accordance with ASC 820-10-35, fair values are based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following describes the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Condition and for estimating the fair value of financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed under ASC 825-10-50. 

Short-term financial assets. Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions and the Federal Reserve are carried at historical cost. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 212 

Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities (Continued) 

Trading securities and trading liabilities. Trading securities and trading liabilities are recognized at fair value through current earnings. Trading inventory held for broker-dealer operations is included in trading securities and trading liabilities. Broker-dealer long positions are valued at bid price in the bid-ask spread. Short positions are valued at the ask price. Inventory positions are valued using observable inputs including current market transactions, LIBOR and U.S. treasury curves, credit spreads, and consensus prepayment speeds. Trading loans are valued using observable inputs including current market transactions, swap rates, mortgage rates, and consensus prepayment speeds. 

Trading securities also include retained interests in prior mortgage securitizations that qualify as financial assets, which include primarily principal-only strips. FHN uses inputs including yield curves, credit spreads, and prepayment speeds to determine the fair value of principal-only strips. 

Securities available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale includes the investment portfolio accounted for as available-for-sale under ASC 320-10-25. Valuations of available-for-sale securities are performed using observable inputs obtained from market transactions in similar securities. Typical inputs include LIBOR and U.S. treasury curves, consensus prepayment estimates, and credit spreads. When available, broker quotes are used to support these valuations. 

Interest only strips are valued at elected fair value based on an income approach using an internal valuation model. The internal valuation model includes assumptions regarding projections of future cash flows, prepayment rates, default rates and interest only strip terms. These securities bear the risk of loan prepayment or default that may result in the Company not recovering all or a portion of its recorded investment. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors including default or prepayment status of the underlying SBA loans. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and may change in the near term. 

Loans held-for-sale. Residential real estate loans held-for-sale are valued using current transaction prices and/or values on similar assets when available, including committed bids for specific loans or loan portfolios. Uncommitted bids may be adjusted based on other available market information. For all other loans FHN determines the fair value of residential real estate loans held-for-sale using a discounted cash flow model which incorporates both observable and unobservable inputs. Inputs include current mortgage rates for similar products, estimated prepayment rates, foreclosure losses, and various loan performance measures (delinquency, LTV, credit score). Adjustments for delinquency and other differences in loan characteristics are typically reflected in the model&#8217;s discount rates. Loss severity trends and the value of underlying collateral are also considered in assessing the appropriate fair value for severely delinquent loans and loans in foreclosure. The valuation of HELOCs also incorporates estimated cancellation rates for loans expected to become delinquent. 

Non-mortgage consumer loans held-for-sale are valued using committed bids for specific loans or loan portfolios or current market pricing for similar assets with adjustments for differences in credit standing (delinquency, historical default rates for similar loans), yield, collateral values and prepayment rates. If pricing for similar assets is not available, a discounted cash flow methodology is utilized, which incorporates all of these factors into an estimate of investor required yield for the discount rate. 

The Company utilizes quoted market prices of similar instruments or broker and dealer quotations to value the SBA and USDA guaranteed loans. The Company values SBA-unguaranteed interests in loans held-for-sale based on individual loan characteristics, such as industry type and pay history which generally follows an income approach. Furthermore, these valuations are adjusted for changes in prepayment estimates and are reduced due to restrictions on trading. The fair value of other non-residential real estate loans held-for-sale is approximated by their carrying values based on current transaction values. 

Collateral-Dependent loans. For loans measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell, fair value is estimated using appraisals of the collateral. Collateral values are monitored and additional write-downs are recognized if it is determined that the estimated collateral values have declined further. Estimated costs to sell are based on current amounts of disposal costs for similar assets. Carrying value is considered to reflect fair value for these loans. 

Derivative assets and liabilities . The fair value for forwards and futures contracts is based on current transactions involving identical securities. Futures contracts are exchange-traded and thus have no credit risk factor assigned as the risk of non-performance is limited to the clearinghouse used. 

Valuations of other derivatives (primarily interest rate related swaps) are based on inputs observed in active markets for similar instruments. Typical inputs include the LIBOR curve, Overnight Indexed Swap (&#8220;OIS&#8221;) curve, option volatility, and option skew. In measuring the fair value of these derivative assets and liabilities, FHN has elected to consider credit risk based on the net exposure to individual counterparties. Credit risk is mitigated for these instruments through the use of mutual margining and 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT 213 

Note 24 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities (Continued) 

master netting agreements as well as collateral posting requirements. For derivative contracts with daily cash margin requirements that are considered settlements, the daily margin amount is netted within derivative assets or liabilities. Any remaining credit risk related to interest rate derivatives is considered in determining fair value through evaluation of additional factors such as customer loan grades and debt ratings. Foreign currency related derivatives also utilize observable exchange rates in the determination of fair value. The determination of fair value for FHN&#8217;s derivative liabilities associated with its prior sales of Visa Class B shares are classified within Level 3 in the fair value measurements disclosure as previously discussed in the unobservable inputs discussion. 

OREO. OREO primarily consists of properties that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt. These properties are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan amount or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the real estate. Estimated fair value is determined using appraised values with subsequent adjustments for deterioration in values that are not reflected in the most recent appraisal. 

Other assets. For disclosure purposes, other assets consist of tax credit investments, FRB and FHLB Stock, deferred compensation mutual funds and equity investments (including other mutual funds) with readily determinable fair values. Tax credit investments accounted for under the equity method are written down to estimated fair value quarterly based on the estimated value of the associated tax credits which incorporates estimates of required yield for hypothetical investors. The fair value of all other tax credit investments is estimated using recent transaction information with adjustments for differences in individual investments. Deferred compensation mutual funds are recognized at fair value, which is based on quoted prices in active markets. 

Investments in the stock of the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Banks are recognized at historical cost in the Consolidated Statements of Condition which is considered to approximate fair value. Investments in mutual funds are measured at the funds&#8217; reported closing net asset values. Investments in equity securities are valued using quoted market prices when available. 

Defined maturity deposits. The fair value of these deposits is estimated by discounting future cash flows to their present value. Future cash flows are discounted by using the current market rates of similar instruments applicable to the remaining maturity. For disclosure purposes, defined maturity deposits include all time deposits. 

Short-term financial liabilities. The fair value of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings are approximated by the book value. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization. 

Loan commitments. Fair values of these commitments are based on fees charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties&#8217; credit standing. 

Other commitments. Fair values of these commitments are based on fees charged to enter into similar agreements. 

The following fair value estimates are determined as of a specific point in time utilizing various assumptions and estimates. The use of assumptions and various valuation techniques, as well as the absence of secondary markets for certain financial instruments, reduces the comparability of fair value disclosures between financial institutions. Due to market illiquidity, the fair values for loans, net of unearned income, loans held-for-sale, and term borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , involve the use of significant internally-developed pricing assumptions for certain components of these line items. The assumptions and valuations utilized for this disclosure are considered to reflect inputs that market participants would use in transactions involving these instruments as of the measurement date. The valuations of legacy assets, particularly consumer loans within the Non-Strategic segment and TRUPS loans, are influenced by changes in economic conditions since origination and risk perceptions of the financial sector. These considerations affect the estimate of a potential acquirer&#8217;s cost of capital and cash flow volatility assumptions from these assets and the resulting fair value measurements may depart significantly from FHN&#8217;s internal estimates of the intrinsic value of these assets. 

Assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments have not been included in the following table such as the value of long-term relationships with deposit and trust customers, premises and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes, and certain other assets and other liabilities. Additionally, these measurements are solely for financial instruments as of the measurement date and do not consider the earnings potential of our various business lines. Accordingly, the total of the fair value amounts does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of FHN.
