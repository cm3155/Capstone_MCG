MANAGEMENT REPORT ON ICOFR ##TABLE_END

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management at First Horizon Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. First Horizon Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Even effective internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations such as the possibility of human error or of circumvention or overriding of controls, and consideration of cost in relation to benefit of a control. Moreover, effectiveness must necessarily be considered according to the existing state of the art of internal control. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may diminish over time. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of First Horizon Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. This assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that First Horizon Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. 

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited First Horizon Corporation's financial statements, issued an audit report on First Horizon Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on the following page.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

First Horizon Corporation: 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited First Horizon Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

First Horizon Corporation: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Horizon Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Assessment of the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s total allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2023 was $773 million, of which a portion related to the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment (the collective ALLL). The collective ALLL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a collective (pooled) basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics. The Company estimated the collective ALLL using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on internal and external information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions that affect the collectability of future cash flows. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company&#8217;s estimates of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and individual loan level exposure at 

##TABLE_START

2023 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

OPINION ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ##TABLE_END

default (EAD), including amortization and prepayment assumptions, on an undiscounted basis. The Company uses models or assumptions to develop expected loss forecasts, inclusive of qualitative adjustments that are affected by the weighting of multiple macroeconomic forecast scenarios over a four year reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company immediately reverts to its historical loss averages, evaluated over the historical observation period, for the remaining estimated life of the loans. In order to capture the unique risks of the loan portfolio within the PD, LGD, and prepayment models, the Company segments the portfolio into pools, generally incorporating loan grades for commercial loans. The Company uses qualitative adjustments to adjust historical loss information in situations where current loan characteristics differ from those in the historical loss information and for differences in economic conditions and other factors. 

We identified the assessment of the collective ALLL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ALLL due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ALLL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD, LGD, and prepayments and their significant assumptions, which included the selection of the economic forecast scenarios and the weighting of each economic scenario. The assessment also included the evaluation of certain qualitative adjustments and their significant assumptions. The significant assumptions are sensitive to variation, such that minor changes in the assumption can cause significant changes in the estimates. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD, LGD, and prepayments models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company&#8217;s measurement of the collective ALLL estimate, including controls over the: 

&#8226; assessment of the collective ALLL methodology 

&#8226; performance monitoring of the PD, LGD and prepayment models 

&#8226; continued use and appropriateness of changes to the PD, LGD, and prepayment models, including the significant assumptions used in the PD, LGD, and prepayment models 

&#8226; selection of the economic scenarios and the weighting of each economic scenario 

&#8226; development of the qualitative adjustments, including the significant assumptions used in the measurement of the qualitative adjustments 

&#8226; analysis of the collective ALLL results, trends, and ratios. 

We evaluated the Company&#8217;s process to develop the collective ALLL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s collective ALLL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 

&#8226; evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the performance testing of the PD, LGD, and prepayment models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 

&#8226; assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD, LGD, and prepayment models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use 

&#8226; evaluating the selection of the economic forecast scenarios and the weighting applied to each scenario by comparing them to the Company&#8217;s business environment and relevant industry practices

&#8226; evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative adjustments and the effect of those adjustments on the collective ALLL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models. 

We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ALLL estimate by evaluating the: 

&#8226; cumulative results of the audit procedures 

&#8226; qualitative aspects of the Company&#8217;s accounting practice 

&#8226; potential bias in the accounting estimates. 

We have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1&#8212; Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Accounting 

The consolidated financial statements of FHN, including its subsidiaries, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and could differ from actual results. 

TD Transaction 

As previously disclosed, on February 27, 2022, FHN entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;TD Merger Agreement&#8221;) with The Toronto-Dominion Bank, a Canadian chartered bank (&#8220;TD&#8221;), and certain TD subsidiaries. On May 4, 2023, FHN and TD mutually terminated the TD Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the termination agreement, TD made a $ 200 million cash payment to FHN, in addition to the $ 25 million fee reimbursement due to FHN pursuant to the TD Merger Agreement. 

Merger and integration planning expenses related to the transactions associated with the TD Merger Agreement ("TD Transaction") are recorded in FHN&#8217;s Corporate segment. Expenses recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 51 million and $ 87 million, respectively. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FHN and other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Variable Interest Entities for which FHN or a subsidiary has been determined to be the primary beneficiary are also consolidated. Affiliates for which FHN is not considered the primary beneficiary and in which FHN does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by the equity method. These investments are included in other assets, and FHN&#8217;s proportionate share of income or loss is included in noninterest income. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Revenues 

Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a client are satisfied in an amount that reflects the consideration FHN expects to be entitled. FHN derives a significant portion of its revenues from fee-based services. Noninterest income from transaction-based fees is generally recognized 

immediately upon completion of the transaction. Noninterest income from service-based fees is generally recognized over the period in which FHN provides the service. Any services performed over time generally require that FHN render services each period and therefore FHN measures progress in completing these services based upon the passage of time and recognizes revenue as invoiced. 

Following is a discussion of FHN's key revenues within the scope of ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", except as noted. 

Fixed Income 

Fixed income includes fixed income securities sales, trading, and strategies, loan sales and derivative sales which are not within the scope of revenue from contracts with customers. Fixed income also includes investment banking fees earned for services related to underwriting debt securities and performing portfolio advisory services. FHN's performance obligation for underwriting services is satisfied on the trade date while advisory services is satisfied over time. 

Mortgage Banking and Title Income 

Mortgage banking and title income includes mortgage servicing income, title income, mortgage loan originations and sales, derivative settlements, as well as any changes in fair value recorded on mortgage loans and derivatives. Mortgage banking income from 1) sale of loans, 2) settlement of derivatives, 3) changes in fair value of loans, derivatives and servicing rights and 4) servicing of loans are not within the scope of revenue from contracts with customers. Prior to the sale of this business during 2022, title income was earned when FHN fulfilled its performance obligation at the point in time when the services were completed. 

Deposit Transactions and Cash Management 

Deposit transactions and cash management activities include fees for services related to consumer and commercial deposit products (such as service charges on checking accounts), cash management products and services such as electronic transaction processing (Automated Clearing House and Electronic Data Interchange), account reconciliation services, cash vault services, lockbox processing, and information reporting to large corporate clients. FHN's obligation for transaction-based services is satisfied at the time of the transaction when the service is delivered while FHN's obligation for service based fees is satisfied over the course of each month.

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

Brokerage, Management Fees and Commissions 

Brokerage, management fees and commissions include fees for portfolio management, trade commissions, and annuity and mutual fund sales. Asset-based management fees are charged based on the market value of the client&#8217;s assets. The services associated with these revenues, which include investment advice and active management of client assets are generally performed and recognized over a month or quarter. Transactional revenues are based on the size and number of transactions executed at the client&#8217;s direction and are generally recognized on the trade date. 

Trust Services and Investment Management 

Trust services and investment management fees include investment management, personal trust, employee benefits, and custodial trust services. Obligations for trust services are generally satisfied over time but may be satisfied at points in time for certain activities that are transactional in nature. 

Card and Digital Banking Fees 

Card and digital banking fees include credit interchange and network revenues and various card-related fees. Interchange income is recognized concurrently with the delivery of services on a daily basis. Card-related fees such as late fees, currency conversion, and cash advance fees are loan-related and excluded from the scope of ASC 606. 

Contract Balances 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accounts receivable related to products and services on non-interest income were $ 13 million and $ 12 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, FHN had no material impairment losses on non-interest accounts receivable and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. Credit risk is assessed on these accounts receivable each reporting period and the amount of estimated uncollectible receivables is not material. 

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced, is not material. 

Refer to Note 19 - Business Segment Information for a reconciliation of disaggregated revenue by major product line and reportable segment. 

Statements of Cash Flows 

For purposes of these statements, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under agreements to resell are considered cash and cash equivalents. Federal funds are usually sold for one-day periods, and securities purchased under agreements to resell are short-term, highly liquid investments. 

Interest-Bearing Deposits With Banks 

Interest-bearing deposits with banks primarily consist of funds on deposit with the Federal Reserve and collateral posted with derivative counterparties. Interest is earned at overnight rates. 

Debt Investment Securities 

Debt securities that may be sold prior to maturity are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses on debt securities AFS, including securities for which no credit impairment exists, are excluded from earnings and are reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Debt securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at amortized cost. See Note 23 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for additional information. Realized gains and losses (i.e., from sales) for debt investment securities are determined by the specific identification method and reported in noninterest income. 

The evaluation of credit risk for HTM debt securities mirrors the process described below for loans held for investment. AFS debt securities are reviewed for potential credit impairment at the individual security level. The evaluation of credit risk includes consideration of third-party and government guarantees (both explicit and implicit), senior or subordinated status, credit ratings of the issuer, the effects of interest rate changes since purchase and observable market information such as issuer-specific credit spreads. Credit losses for AFS debt securities are generally recognized through establishment of an allowance for credit losses that cannot exceed the amount by which amortized cost exceeds fair value. Charge-offs are recorded as reductions of the security&#8217;s amortized cost and the credit allowance. Subsequent improvements in estimated credit losses result in reduction of the credit allowance, but not beyond zero. However, if FHN has the intent to sell or if it is more-likely-than-not that it will be compelled to sell a security with an unrecognized loss, the difference between the security's carrying value and fair value is recognized through earnings and a new amortized cost basis is established for the security (i.e., no allowance for credit losses is recognized). 

FHN has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the fair value and amortized cost basis on debt securities when assessing whether these securities have

2023 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

experienced credit impairment. Additionally, FHN has elected to not measure an allowance for credit losses on AIR for debt securities based on its policy to write off uncollectible interest in a timely manner, which generally occurs when delinquency reaches no more than 90 days for all security types. Any such write offs are recognized as a reduction of interest income. AIR for debt securities is included within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Equity Investments 

Equity investments are classified in other assets. Banks organized under state law may apply to be members of the Federal Reserve System. Each member bank is required to own stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. Given this requirement, FRB stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as collateral for loans. Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank network requires ownership of capital stock. Member banks are entitled to borrow funds from the FHLB and are required to pledge mortgage loans as collateral. Investments in the FHLB are non-transferable and, generally, membership is maintained primarily to provide a source of liquidity as needed. FRB and FHLB stock are recorded at cost and are subject to impairment reviews. FHN's subsidiary, First Horizon Bank, was a state member bank throughout 2023. 

Other equity investments primarily consist of mutual funds which are marked to fair value through earnings. Smaller balances of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost minus impairment with adjustments through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 

Federal Funds Sold and Purchased 

Federal funds sold and purchased represent unsecured overnight funding arrangements between participants in the Federal Reserve system primarily to assist banks in meeting their regulatory cash reserve requirements. Federal Funds Sold are evaluated for credit risk each reporting period. Due to the short duration of each transaction and the history of no credit losses, no credit loss has been recognized. 

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 

FHN purchases short-term securities under agreements to resell which are accounted for as collateralized financings except where FHN does not have an agreement to sell the same or substantially the same securities before maturity at a fixed or determinable price. All of FHN&#8217;s securities purchased under agreements to resell are recognized as collateralized financings. Securities delivered under these transactions are delivered to either the dealer custody account at the FRB or to the applicable counterparty. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are offered to cash management clients as an automated, 

collateralized investment account. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are also used by the consumer/commercial bank to obtain favorable borrowing rates on its purchased funds. All of FHN's securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured borrowings. 

Collateral is valued daily and FHN may require counterparties to deposit additional securities or cash as collateral, or FHN may return cash or securities previously pledged by counterparties, or FHN may be required to post additional securities or cash as collateral, based on the contractual requirements for these transactions. 

FHN&#8217;s fixed income business utilizes securities borrowing arrangements as part of its trading operations. Securities borrowing transactions generally require FHN to deposit cash with the securities lender. The amount of cash advanced is recorded within securities purchased under agreements to resell in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These transactions are not considered purchases and the securities borrowed are not recognized by FHN. FHN does not conduct securities lending transactions. 

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowing arrangements are evaluated for credit risk each reporting period. As presented in Note 22 - Master Netting and Similar Agreements - Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, and Securities Borrowing Transactions, these agreements are collateralized by the related securities and collateral maintenance provisions with counterparties, including replenishment and adjustment on a transaction specific basis. This collateral includes both the securities collateral for each transaction as well as offsetting securities sold under agreements to repurchase with the same counterparty. Given the history of no credit losses and collateralized nature of these transactions, no credit loss has been recognized. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans originated or purchased for which management lacks the intent to hold are included in loans held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. FHN generally accounts for loans held for sale at the lower of amortized cost or market value, with an exception for certain mortgage loans held for sale and repurchased loans that are not government insured which are accounted for under the fair value option of reporting. 

&#8226; Fair Value Option Election. These loans consist of originated fixed rate single-family residential mortgage loans that are committed to be sold in the secondary market. Gains and losses on these mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking and title income. 

&#8226; Other loans held for sale. For these loans, gains on sale are recognized through noninterest income. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance that is also recorded as a charge to noninterest income.

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

Loans and Leases 

Generally, loans are stated at principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income. Interest on loans is recognized on an accrual basis at the applicable interest rate on the principal amount outstanding. Loan origination fees and direct costs as well as premiums and discounts are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms. Unamortized net fees or costs, premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income upon early repayment of the loans. Loan commitment fees are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. 

Equipment financing leases to commercial clients are primarily classified as direct financing and sales-type leases. Equipment financing leases are reported at the net lease investment, which represents the sum of minimum lease payments over the lease term and the estimated residual value, less unearned interest income. Interest income is accrued as earned over the term of the lease based on the net investment in leases. Fees incurred to originate the lease are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield on the lease. 

FHN has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis on its held-for-investment loan portfolio. FHN has also elected to not measure an allowance for credit losses on AIR for loans held for investment based on its policy to write off uncollectible interest in a timely manner, which occurs when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Such write-offs are recognized as a reduction of interest income. AIR for held-for-investment loans is included within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans 

Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or on a case-by-case basis if FHN continues to receive payments, but there are other borrower-specific issues. Consumer loans are generally placed into nonaccrual status no later than 90 days past due. 

&#8226; Residential real estate loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (&#8220;discharged bankruptcies&#8221;) are placed on nonaccrual. They are not returned to accrual status even if current and performing in the future. 

&#8226; Current second lien residential real estate loans that are junior to first liens are placed on nonaccrual status if in bankruptcy. 

When commercial and consumer loans within each portfolio segment and class are placed on nonaccrual status, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed and charged against interest income. Management may elect 

to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to recover the principal balance and accrued interest. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are normally applied to outstanding principal first. Once all principal has been received, additional interest payments are recognized on a cash basis as interest income. 

Generally, commercial and consumer loans within each portfolio segment and class that have been placed on nonaccrual status can be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest is current and FHN expects full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. This typically requires that a borrower make payments in accordance with the contractual terms for a sustained period of time (generally for a minimum of six months) before being returned to accrual status. 

Residential real estate loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are not returned to accrual status. For current second liens that have been placed on nonaccrual because the first lien is 90 or more days past due, the second lien may be returned to accrual upon pay-off or cure of the first lien. 

Charge-offs 

For all commercial and consumer loan portfolio segments, all losses of principal are charged to the ALLL in the period in which the loan is deemed to be uncollectible. 

For consumer loans, the timing of a full or partial charge-off generally depends on the loan type and delinquency status. Generally, for the consumer real estate segment, a loan will be either partially or fully charged-off when it becomes 180 days past due. At this time, if the collateral value does not support foreclosure, balances are fully charged-off and other avenues of recovery are pursued. If the collateral value supports foreclosure, the loan is charged-down to net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell) and is placed on nonaccrual status. For residential real estate loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower, the fair value of the collateral position is assessed at the time FHN is made aware of the discharge and the loan is charged down to the net realizable value (collateral value less estimated costs to sell). Within the credit card and other portfolio segment, credit cards are normally charged-off upon reaching 180 days past due while other non-real estate consumer loans are charged-off or partially charged-off upon reaching 120 days past due. 

For acquired PCD loans where all or a portion of the loan balance had been charged off prior to acquisition, and for which active collection efforts are still underway, the ALLL recorded at acquisition is immediately charged off if required by FHN&#8217;s existing charge off policy. Additionally, FHN is required to consider its existing policies in determining whether to charge off any financial assets, regardless of whether a charge-off was recorded by the predecessor company. The initial ALLL recognized on PCD

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

assets includes the gross-up of the loan balance reduced by immediate charge-offs for loans previously charged off by the predecessor company or which meet FHN&#8217;s charge-off policy on the date of acquisition. Charge-offs against the allowance related to such acquired PCD loans do not result in an income statement impact. 

Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Loans 

At the time of acquisition FHN evaluates all acquired loans to determine if they have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. PCD loans can be identified on either an 1) individual or 2) pooled basis when the loans share similar risk characteristics. FHN evaluates various absolute factors to assist in the identification of PCD loans, including criteria such as, existing PCD status, risk rating of special mention or lower, nonaccrual or impaired status, identification of prior loan modifications, and delinquency status. FHN also utilizes relative factors to identify PCD loans such as commercial loan grade migration, expansion of borrower credit spreads, declines in external risk ratings and changes in consumer loan characteristics (e.g., FICO decline or LTV increase). In addition, factors reflective of broad economic considerations are also considered in identifying PCD loans. These include industry, collateral type, and geographic location for the borrower&#8217;s operations. Internal factors for origination of new loans that are similar to the acquired loans are also evaluated to assess loans for PCD status, including increases in required yields, necessity of borrowers&#8217; providing additional collateral and/or guarantees and changes in acceptable loan duration. Other indicators may also be used to evaluate loans for PCD status depending on borrower-specific communications and actions, such public statements, initiation of loan modification discussions and obtaining emergency funding from alternate sources. 

Upon acquisition, the expected credit losses are allocated to the purchase price of individual PCD loans to determine each individual asset's amortized cost basis, typically resulting in a reduction of the discount that is accreted prospectively to interest income. At the acquisition date and prospectively, only the unpaid principal balance is incorporated within the estimation of expected credit losses for PCD loans. Otherwise, the process for estimation of expected credit losses is consistent with that discussed below. As discussed below FHN applies undiscounted cash flow methodologies for the estimation of expected credit losses, which results in the calculated amount of credit losses at acquisition that is added to the amortized cost basis of the related PCD loans to exceed the discounted value of estimated credit losses included in the loan valuation. 

For PCD loans where all or a portion of the loan balance has been previously written-off, or would be subject to write-off under FHN&#8217;s charge-off policy, the initial ALLL included as part of the grossed-up loan balance at acquisition was immediately written-off, resulting in a 

zero period-end allowance balance and no impact on the ALLL rollforward. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The nature of the process by which FHN determines the appropriate ACL requires the exercise of considerable judgment. The ACL is determined in accordance with ASC 326-20 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" which was adopted on January 1, 2020. See Note 4 - Allowance for Credit Losses for a discussion of FHN&#8217;s ACL methodology and a description of the models utilized in the estimation process for the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 

Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates or, if required by regulators, based upon information at the time of their examinations or upon future regulatory guidance. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates. 

Management's estimate of expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio is recorded in the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, collectively the ACL. The ACL is maintained at a level that management determines is appropriate to absorb current expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. Management uses analytical models to estimate expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments as of the balance sheet date. The models are carefully reviewed to identify trends that may not be captured in the modeled loss estimates. Management uses qualitative adjustments for those items not reflected in the modeled loss information such as recent changes from the macroeconomic forecasts utilized in model calculations, results of additional stressed modeling scenarios, observed and/or expected changes affecting borrowers in specific industries or geographic areas, exposure to large lending relationships and expected recoveries of prior charge offs. Qualitative adjustments are also used to accommodate for the imprecision of certain assumptions and uncertainties inherent in the model calculations as well as to align certain differences in models used by acquired loan portfolios to the methodologies described herein. Loans accounted for at elected fair value are excluded from CECL measurements. 

The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses and is decreased by loan charge-offs. Credit loss estimation is based on the amortized cost of loans, which includes the following: 

1. Unpaid principal balance for originated assets or acquisition price for purchased assets 

2. Accrued interest (see elections discussed previously) 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 119 

2023 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

3. Accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees or costs 

4. Collection of cash 

5. Charge-offs 

Premiums, discounts and net deferred origination costs/fees affect the calculated amount of expected credit losses but they are not considered when determining the amount of expected credit losses that are recorded. 

Under CECL, a loan must be pooled when it shares similar risk characteristics with other loans. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually. Expected credit loss is estimated for the remaining life of loan(s), which is limited to the remaining contractual term(s), adjusted for prepayment estimates, which are included as separate inputs into modeled loss estimates. Renewals and extensions are not anticipated unless they are included in existing loan documentation and are not unconditionally cancellable by the lender. However, prior to January 1, 2023, losses were estimated over the estimated remaining life of reasonably expected TDRs which could extend beyond the current remaining contractual term. 

Management has developed multiple current expected credit losses models which segment the loan and lease portfolio by borrower type and loan or lease type to estimate expected lifetime expected credit losses for loans and leases that share similar risk characteristics. Estimates of expected credit losses incorporate consideration of available information that is relevant to assessing the collectability of future cash flows. This includes internal and external information relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. FHN utilizes internal and external historical loss information, as applicable, for all available historical periods as the initial point for estimating expected credit losses. Given the duration of historical information available, FHN considers its internal loss history to fully incorporate the effects of prior credit cycles. The historical loss information may be adjusted in situations where current loan characteristics (e.g., underwriting criteria) differ from those in existence at the time the historical losses occurred. Historical loss information is also adjusted for differences in economic conditions, macroeconomic forecasts and other factors management considers relevant over a period extending beyond the measurement date which is considered reasonable and supportable. 

FHN generally measures expected credit losses using undiscounted cash flow methodologies. Credit enhancements (e.g., guarantors) that are not freestanding are considered in the estimation of uncollectible cash flows. Estimation of expected credit losses for loan agreements involving collateral maintenance provisions include consideration of the value of the collateral and 

replenishment requirements, with the maximum loss limited to the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the fair value of the collateral. Expected credit losses for loans for which foreclosure is probable are measured at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell when disposition through sale is anticipated. Additionally, for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty certain loans are valued at the fair value of collateral when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is reduced for estimated costs to sell when repayment is expected through sale of the collateral. Prior to January 1, 2023, expected credit losses for TDRs were measured in accordance with ASC 310-40, which generally required a discounted cash flow methodology, whereby the loans were measured based on the present value of expected future payments discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2022-02, FHN has ceased recognition of TDRs and no longer performs discounted cash flow calculations for these loans to estimate expected credit losses. FHN now monitors and discloses information associated with modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For both commercial and consumer portfolio segments, an adjustment to the ACL is generally not recorded at the time of modification because FHN includes these modified loans in its quantitative loss estimation processes. In the event of principal forgiveness, which primarily occurs for commercial loan workouts and consumer loans experiencing bankruptcy, FHN records the reduction in expected collectible principal balance as a charge-off against the ALLL. 

Expected recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are also included as a qualitative adjustment in the estimation of expected credit losses, which reduces the amount of the allowance recognized. Estimates of recoveries on previously charged-off assets included in the allowance for loan losses do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously written off and expected to be written off for an individual loan or pool. 

Since CECL requires the estimation of credit losses for the entire expected life of loans, loss estimates are highly sensitive to changes in macroeconomic forecasts, especially when those forecasts change dramatically in short time periods. Additionally, under CECL credit loss estimates are more likely to increase rapidly in periods of loan growth. 

Expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are estimated for periods where the commitment is not unconditionally cancellable by FHN. The measurement of expected credit losses for unfunded commitments mirrors that of loans with the additional estimate of future draw rates (timing and amount). The liability for credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, is included in

other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and established through a charge to the provision for credit losses. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and include additions that materially extend the useful lives of existing premises and equipment. All other maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred. Premises and equipment held for sale are generally valued at appraised values which reference recent disposition values for similar property types but also consider marketability discounts for vacant properties. The valuations of premises and equipment held for sale are reduced by estimated costs to sell. Impairments, and any subsequent recoveries, are recorded in noninterest expense. Gains and losses on dispositions are reflected in noninterest income and expense, respectively. 

Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and are recorded as noninterest expense. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease periods or the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Useful lives utilized in determining depreciation for furniture, fixtures and equipment and for buildings are three years to fifteen years and seven years to forty-five years , respectively. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Real estate acquired by foreclosure or other real estate-owned consists of properties that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt. These properties are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan amount or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the real estate. At the time acquired, and in conjunction with the transfer from loans to OREO, there is a charge-off against the ALLL if the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the loan&#8217;s cost basis. Subsequent declines in fair value and gains or losses on dispositions, if any, are charged to other expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Required developmental costs associated with acquired property under construction are capitalized and included in determining the estimated net realizable value of the property, which is reviewed periodically, and any write-downs are charged against current earnings. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses less identifiable intangible assets. On an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, FHN assesses goodwill for impairment. Other intangible assets primarily represent client lists and relationships, acquired contracts, covenants not to compete and premium on purchased deposits, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets related to acquired deposit bases are primarily amortized over 10 

years using an accelerated method. Management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining useful life or carrying value of amortizing intangibles should be revised. Other intangibles also include smaller amounts of non-amortizing intangibles for title plant and state banking licenses. 

Servicing Rights 

FHN recognizes the rights to service mortgage and other loans as separate assets, which are recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying loans by sale with servicing rights retained. For loan sales with servicing retained, a servicing right, generally an asset, is recorded at fair value at the time of sale for the right to service the loans sold. All servicing rights are identified by class and amortized over the remaining life of the loan with periodic reviews for impairment. 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

Transfers of financial assets, or portions thereof which meet the definition of a participating interest, are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when 1) the assets have been legally isolated from FHN, 2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a trivial benefit to FHN, and 3) FHN does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. If the transfer does not satisfy all three criteria, the transaction is recorded as a secured borrowing. If the transfer is accounted for as a sale, the transferred assets are derecognized from FHN&#8217;s balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing, the transferred assets remain on FHN&#8217;s balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

FHN accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815 which requires recognition of all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value through adjustments to either accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity or current earnings. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell a derivative asset or paid to transfer a derivative liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the transaction date. Fair value is determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. FHN has elected to present its derivative assets and liabilities gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts of collateral posted or received have not been netted with the related derivatives unless the collateral amounts are considered legal settlements of the related derivative positions. See 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 121

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

Note 21 - Derivatives for discussion on netting of derivatives. 

FHN prepares written hedge documentation, identifying the risk management objective and designating the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge as applicable, or as a free-standing derivative instrument entered into as an economic hedge or to meet clients&#8217; needs. All transactions designated as ASC 815 hedges must be assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in earnings. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings as the hedged transaction impacts net income. For fair value hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of effectiveness is recorded to the same financial statement line item (e.g., interest expense) used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the entire fair value change of the hedging instrument that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and later recycled into earnings as the hedged transaction(s) affect net income with the income statement effects recorded in the same financial statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item (e.g., interest income). For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are recognized currently in earnings. See Note 21 - Derivatives for additional information. 

Cash flows from derivative contracts are reported as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Leases 

At inception, all arrangements are evaluated to determine if they contain a lease, which is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is deemed to exist when a lessor has granted and a lessee has received both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. 

Lessee 

As a lessee, FHN recognizes lease (right-of-use) assets and lease liabilities for all leasing arrangements with lease terms that are greater than one year. The lease asset and lease liability are recognized at the present value of estimated future lease payments, including estimated renewal periods, with the discount rate reflecting a fully- 

collateralized rate matching the estimated lease term. Renewal options are included in the estimated lease term if they are considered reasonably certain of exercise. Periods covered by termination options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain they will not be exercised. Additionally, prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives and initial direct costs related to lease arrangements are recognized within the right-of-use asset. Each lease is classified as a financing or operating lease which depends on the relationship of the lessee&#8217;s rights to the economic value of the leased asset. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in earnings, resulting in higher expense in the earlier portion of the lease term. For operating leases, a single lease cost is calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. Substantially all of FHN&#8217;s lessee arrangements are classified as operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, FHN does not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Lease assumptions and classification are reassessed upon the occurrence of events that result in changes to the estimated lease term or consideration. Modifications to lease contracts are evaluated to determine 1) if a right to use an additional asset has been obtained, 2) if only the lease term and/or consideration have been revised or 3) if a full or partial termination has occurred. If an additional right-of use-asset has been obtained, the modification is treated as a separate contract and its classification is evaluated as a new lease arrangement. If only the lease term or consideration are changed, the lease liability is revalued with an offset to the lease asset and the lease classification is re-assessed. If a modification results in a full or partial termination of the lease, the lease liability is revalued through earnings along with a proportionate reduction in the value of the related lease asset and subsequent expense recognition is similar to a new lease arrangement. 

Lease assets are evaluated for impairment when triggering events occur, such as a change in management intent regarding the continued occupation of the leased space. If a lease asset is impaired, it is written down to the present value of estimated future cash flows and the prospective expense recognition for that lease follows the accelerated expense recognition methodology applicable to finance leases, even if it remains classified as an operating lease. 

Sublease arrangements are accounted for consistent with the lessor accounting described below. Sublease arrangements are evaluated to determine if changes to estimates for the primary lease are warranted or if the sublease terms reflect impairment of the related lease asset. 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 122 

2023 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

Lease assets are recognized in other assets and lease liabilities are recognized in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since substantially all of its leasing arrangements relate to real estate, FHN records lease expense, and any related sublease income, within Occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Lessor 

As a lessor, FHN also evaluates its lease arrangements to determine whether a finance lease or an operating lease exists and utilizes the rate implicit in the lease arrangement as the discount rate to calculate the present value of future cash flows. Depending upon the terms of the individual agreements, finance leases represent either sales-type or direct financing leases, both of which require de-recognition of the asset being leased with offsetting recognition of a lease receivable that is evaluated for impairment similar to loans. Other than equipment leases entered into as part of commercial lease financing arrangements, all of FHN's lessor arrangements are considered operating leases. 

Lease income for operating leases is recognized over the life of the lease, generally on a straight-line basis. Lease incentives and initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the lease. Lease income is not significant for any reporting periods and is classified as a reduction of net occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Investment Tax Credit 

FHN has elected to utilize the deferral method for acquired investments that generate investment tax credits. This includes both solar and historic tax credit investments. Under this approach the investment tax credits are recorded as an offset to the related investment on the balance sheet. Credit amounts are recognized in earnings over the life of the investment within the same income or expense accounts as used for the investment. 

Advertising and Public Relations 

Advertising and public relations costs are generally expensed as incurred. 

Income Taxes 

FHN accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method pursuant to ASC 740, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, FHN&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax basis of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a 

change in tax rates on DTAs and DTLs is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Additionally, DTAs are subject to a &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test to determine whether the full amount of the DTAs should be recognized in the financial statements. FHN evaluates the likelihood of realization of the DTA based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time, including (as appropriate) scheduled reversals of DTLs, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. If the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test is not met, a valuation allowance must be established against the DTA. In the event FHN determines that DTAs are realizable in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, FHN would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce income tax expense. 

FHN records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority is recognized. FHN's ASC 740 policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax asset/liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

FHN and its eligible subsidiaries are included in a consolidated federal income tax return. FHN files separate returns for subsidiaries that are not eligible to be included in a consolidated federal income tax return. Based on the laws of the applicable state where it conducts business operations, FHN either files consolidated, combined, or separate returns. 

Earnings per Share 

Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period. Diluted earnings per share in net income periods is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential dilutive common shares resulting from performance shares and units, restricted shares and units, and options granted under FHN&#8217;s equity compensation plans and deferred compensation arrangements had been issued. FHN utilizes the treasury stock method in this calculation. Diluted earnings per share does not reflect an adjustment for potentially dilutive shares in periods in which a net loss available to common shareholders exists.

NOTE 1&#8212;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

Equity Compensation 

FHN accounts for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the grant date fair value of an award to determine the expense to be recognized over the life of the award. Stock options are valued using an option-pricing model, such as Black-Scholes. Restricted and performance shares and share units are valued at the stock price on the grant date. For awards with service vesting criteria, expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. For awards vesting based on a performance measure, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. If a performance period extends beyond the required service term, total expense is adjusted for changes in estimated achievement through the end of the performance period. Some performance awards include a total shareholder return modifier (&#8220;TSR Modifier&#8221;) that operates after determination of the performance criteria, affecting only the quantity of awards issued if the minimum performance threshold is attained. The effect of the TSR Modifier is included in the grant date fair value of the related performance awards using a Monte Carlo valuation technique. The fair value of equity awards with cash payout requirements, as well as awards for which fair value cannot be estimated at grant date, is remeasured each reporting period through vesting date. Performance awards with pre-grant date achievement criteria are expensed over the period from the start of the performance period through the end of the service vesting term. Awards are amortized using the nonsubstantive vesting methodology which requires that expense associated with awards having only service vesting criteria that continue vesting after retirement be recognized over a period ending no later than an employee&#8217;s retirement eligibility date. 

Cash settled awards with payouts partially or fully based on changes in share price are accounted for as liability awards and are remeasured based on changes in their fair value, until the end of the performance period. Compensation cost for each reporting period is based on the change in the fair value of the award within each reporting period adjusted for the portion of required service that occurred during the reporting period. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Provision 

The repurchase and foreclosure provision is the charge to earnings necessary to maintain the liability at a level that reflects management&#8217;s best estimate of losses associated with the repurchase of loans previously transferred in whole loans sales or securitizations, or make whole requests as of the balance sheet date. See Note 16 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures for discussion related to FHN&#8217;s obligations to repurchase such loans. 

Legal Costs 

Generally, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to equity issuances are netted against capital surplus. Costs related to debt issuances are included in debt issuance costs that are recorded within term borrowings. Costs related to equity issuances are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from the related issuance. 

Contingency Accruals 

Contingent liabilities arise in the ordinary course of business, including those related to lawsuits, arbitration, mediation, and other forms of litigation. FHN establishes loss contingency liabilities for matters when loss is both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC 450-20-50 &#8220;Contingencies &#8211; Accruals for Loss Contingencies&#8221;. If loss for a matter is probable and a range of possible loss outcomes is the best estimate available, accounting guidance generally requires a liability to be established at the low end of the range. Expected recoveries from insurance and indemnification arrangements are recognized if they are considered equally as probable and reasonably estimable as the related loss contingency up to the recognized amount of the estimated loss. Gain contingencies and expected recoveries from insurance and indemnification arrangements in excess of the associated recorded estimated losses are generally recognized when received. Recognized recoveries are recorded as offsets to the related expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The favorable resolution of a gain contingency generally results in the recognition of other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Contingencies assumed in business combinations are evaluated through the end of the one-year post-closing measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value of the contingency can be determined during the measurement period, recognition occurs as part of the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired business. If the acquisition-date fair value of the contingency cannot be determined, but loss is considered probable as of the acquisition date and can be reasonably estimated within the measurement period, then the estimated amount is recorded within acquisition accounting. If the requirements for inclusion of the contingency as part of the acquisition are not met, subsequent recognition of the contingency is included in earnings. 

Business Combinations 

Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are generally recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with the related transaction costs expensed in the period incurred. Specified items such as net investment in leases as lessor, acquired operating lease assets and liabilities as lessee, employee benefit plans and income-tax related balances are recognized in accordance with accounting guidance that results in measurements that may differ from fair value. FHN may

The provisional valuation estimates may be adjusted for a period of up to one year (&#8220;measurement period&#8221;) from the date of acquisition if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Business combinations are included in the financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Adjustments recorded during the measurement period are recognized in the current reporting period. 

The excess of purchase price over the valuation of specifically identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. In certain circumstances the net values of assets and liabilities acquired may exceed the purchase price, which is recognized within non-interest income as a purchase accounting gain. 

Accounting Changes With Extended Transition Periods 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, &#8220;Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting&#8221; which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The provisions of ASU 2020-04 primarily affect 1) contract modifications (e.g., loans, leases, debt, and derivatives) made in anticipation that a reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) will be discontinued and 2) the application of hedge accounting for existing relationships affected by those modifications. The provisions of ASU 2020-04 were effective upon release and apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Including the adoption of ASU 2022-06 (discussed below), the expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2024, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. 

FHN identified contracts affected by reference rate reform, developed modification plans for those contracts and implemented those modifications before the last quotation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023. FHN elected to utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications that immediately converted the reference rate within each contract. FHN also elected that revisions to contractual fallback provisions, including modifications in accordance with the provisions of Regulation ZZ, did not require evaluation for modification accounting. Additionally, FHN elected that the revisions to derivative contracts implemented by central clearinghouses to convert centrally cleared derivative contracts from LIBOR to SOFR plus an 

appropriate spread adjustment were not considered changes requiring assessment for modification accounting. 

During the transition period, for cash flow hedges that reference 1-Month USD LIBOR, FHN applied expedients related to 1) the assumption of probability of cash flows when reference rates are changed on hedged items 2) avoiding dedesignation when critical terms (i.e., reference rates) change and 3) the allowed assumption of shared risk exposure for hedged items. Additionally, for its cash flow hedges that reference 1-Month Term SOFR, FHN applied expedients related to 1) the allowed assumption of shared risk exposure for hedged items and 2) multiple allowed assumptions of conformity between hedged items and the hedging instrument when assessing effectiveness. FHN continued to utilize these expedients and exceptions through the final cash flows affected by the quotation of LIBOR. 

In accordance with the provisions of ASU 2020-04, effective immediately after the end of the transition period for its cash flow hedges (i.e., no more cash flows were affected by LIBOR), FHN elected that the cessation of effectiveness assessments under the transition guidance and subsequent initiation of hedge effectiveness assessments under ASC 815 did not require dedesignation of the hedge relationships. 

In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, "Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848" which extends the transition window for ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, consistent with key USD LIBOR tenors continuing to be published through June 30, 2023. 

In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, "Scope" to expand the scope of ASU 2020-04 to apply to certain contract modifications that were implemented in October 2020 by derivative clearinghouses for the use of the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) in discounting, margining and price alignment for centrally cleared derivatives, including derivatives utilized in hedging relationships. ASU 2021-01 also applies to derivative contracts affected by the change in discounting convention regardless of whether they are centrally cleared (i.e., bi-lateral contracts can also be modified) and regardless of whether they reference LIBOR. ASU 2021-01 was effective immediately upon issuance with retroactive application permitted. FHN elected to retroactively apply the provisions of ASU 2021-01 because FHN's centrally cleared derivatives were affected by the change in discounting convention and because FHN has other bi-lateral derivative contracts that may be modified to conform to the use of SOFR for discounting. Adoption did not have a significant effect on FHN's reported financial condition or results of operations.

Summary of Accounting Changes 

ASU 2022-01 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, "Fair Value Hedging &#8212; Portfolio Layer Method", which expanded FHN's ability to hedge the benchmark interest rate risk of portfolios of financial interests (or beneficial interests) in a fair value hedge. The provisions of ASU 2022-01 also permit FHN to apply the same portfolio hedging method to both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets, namely by expanding the use of the "portfolio layer" method to non-prepayable financial assets. ASU 2022-01 also permits multiple hedged layers to be designated as a single closed portfolio to achieve hedge accounting. Additionally, the ASU requires that basis adjustments must be maintained on the closed portfolio of assets as a whole, and not allocated to individual assets for active portfolio layer method hedges. ASU 2022-01 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. FHN may utilize the provisions of ASU 2022-01 in its future hedging strategies. 

ASU 2022-02 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, &#8220;Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures&#8221; that eliminates current TDR recognition and measurement guidance and instead requires the Company to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan (which is consistent with the accounting for other loan modifications). The provisions of ASU 2022-02 also enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new disclosures related to certain modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The provisions of this ASU also require FHN to disclose current period gross write-offs of loans and leases by year of origination. 

ASU 2022-02 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For the transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, FHN elected to apply the modified retrospective transition effective January 1, 2023, resulting in a cumulative-effect reduction in ALLL of $ 6 million and an increase to retained earnings of $ 4 million, net of tax. The disclosure provisions of ASU 2022-02 were applied prospectively and presented in Note 3 &#8211; Loans and Leases and Note 4 &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Accounting Changes Issued But Not Currently Effective 

ASU 2023-02 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, &#8220;Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method&#8221; which permits investors to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the 

proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax provision (benefit). Prior to ASU 2023-02, the proportional amortization method was only available to qualifying low income housing equity investments. An investor is required to make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis. An investor that applies the proportional amortization method to qualifying tax equity investments must account for the receipt of the investment tax credits using the flow-through method, even if the entity applies the deferral method for other investment tax credits received. ASU 2023-02 also requires specific disclosures that must be applied to all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program for which the entity has elected to apply the proportional amortization method. 

ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in any interim period. If ASU 2023-02 is adopted in an interim period, it must be adopted as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. Adoption of ASU 2023-02 is applied on either a modified retrospective (cumulative catch up) or a retrospective (restatement of prior years) basis. FHN has assessed the applicability of ASU 2023-02 to its tax credit program equity investments and determined that it will make the proportional method election for New Markets Tax Credit and Historic Tax Credit programs. The use of the proportional amortization method will continue for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-02 FHN will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to increase retained earnings for $ 8 million, net of tax, on January 1, 2024. 

ASU 2023-07 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" that requires public entities to provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The ASU requires a public entity to disclose, for each reportable segment, the significant expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) and included in each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported

measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. 

ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. FHN is currently assessing the effects of ASU 2023-07 on its reportable segment disclosures. 

ASU 2023-09 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to enhance transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The provisions of this ASU require disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation in both percentages and 

reporting currency amounts. Certain categories of reconciling items are required by the ASU with additional categories required if a specified quantitative threshold is met. Reporting entities are also required to provide a qualitative discussion of the primary state and local jurisdictions for income taxes and the type of reconciling categories. ASU 2023-09 also requires disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. 

For public business entities, ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2024. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. FHN is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its income tax disclosures.

FHN has evaluated all AFS debt securities that were in unrealized loss positions in accordance with its accounting policy for recognition of credit losses. No AFS debt securities were determined to have credit losses. Total AIR not included in the fair value or amortized cost basis of 

AFS debt securities was $ 32 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Consistent with FHN's review of the related securities, there were no credit-related write downs of AIR for AFS debt securities during the reporting periods. Additionally, for AFS debt securities

with unrealized losses, FHN does not intend to sell them and it is more-likely-than-not that FHN will not be required to sell them prior to recovery. Therefore, no write downs of these investments to fair value occurred during the reporting periods. There were no transfers to or from AFS or HTM securities during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. 

For HTM securities, an allowance for credit losses is required to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses. Total AIR not included in the fair value or amortized cost basis of HTM debt securities was $ 3 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. FHN has assessed the risk of credit loss and has determined that no allowance for credit losses for HTM securities was necessary as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The evaluation of credit risk includes consideration of third-party and government 

guarantees (both explicit and implicit), senior or subordinated status, credit ratings of the issuer, the effects of interest rate changes since purchase and observable market information such as issuer-specific credit spreads. 

The carrying amount of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value was $ 89 million and $ 79 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The year-to-date gross amounts of upward and downward valuation adjustments included a $ 6 million loss for 2023 and were insignificant for 2022. 

Unrealized gains of $ 11 million, unrealized losses of $ 11 million and unrealized gains of $ 3 million were recognized during 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, for equity investments with readily determinable fair values.

Note 3&#8212; Loans and Leases 

The loan and lease portfolio is disaggregated into portfolio segments and then further disaggregated into classes for certain disclosures. GAAP defines a portfolio segment as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. A class is generally a disaggregation of a portfolio segment and is generally determined based on risk characteristics of the loan and FHN&#8217;s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk and performance. FHN's loan and lease portfolio segments are commercial and consumer. The classes of loans and leases are: (1) commercial, financial, and industrial, which includes 

commercial and industrial loans and leases and loans to mortgage companies, (2) commercial real estate, (3) consumer real estate, which includes both real estate installment and home equity lines of credit, and (4) credit card and other. 

The following table provides the amortized cost basis of loans and leases by portfolio segment and class as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, excluding accrued interest of $ 287 million and $ 226 million, respectively, which is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Restrictions 

Loans and leases with carrying values of $ 46.1 billion and $ 38.3 billion were pledged as collateral for borrowings at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Most of the FHN&#8217;s business activity is with clients located in the southern United States. FHN&#8217;s lending activity is concentrated in its market areas within those states. As of December 31, 2023, FHN had loans to mortgage companies of $ 2.0 billion and loans to finance and insurance companies of $ 4.1 billion. As a result, 18 % of the C&#38;I portfolio is sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

FHN employs a dual grade commercial risk grading methodology to assign an estimate for the probability of default and the loss given default for each commercial 

loan using factors specific to various industry, portfolio, or product segments that result in a rank ordering of risk and the assignment of grades PD 1 to PD 16 . This credit grading system is intended to identify and measure the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio by analyzing the migration between grading categories. It is also integral to the estimation methodology utilized in determining the ALLL since an allowance is established for pools of commercial loans based on the credit grade assigned. Each PD grade corresponds to an estimated one-year default probability percentage. PD grades are continually evaluated, but require a formal scorecard annually. 

PD 1 through PD 12 are &#8220;pass&#8221; grades. PD grades 13-16 correspond to the regulatory-defined categories of special mention (13), substandard (14), doubtful (15), and loss (16). Special mention commercial loans and leases have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result

in deterioration of FHN's credit position at some future date. Substandard commercial loans and leases have well-defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that FHN will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful commercial loans and leases have the same weaknesses as substandard loans and leases with the added characteristics that the 

probability of loss is high and collection of the full amount is improbable.

The consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of smaller-balance loans which are very similar in nature in that most are standard products and are backed by residential real estate. Because of the similarities of consumer loan types, FHN is able to utilize the FICO score, among other attributes, to assess the credit quality of consumer borrowers. FICO scores are refreshed on a quarterly basis in an attempt to reflect the recent risk profile of the borrowers. Accruing delinquency amounts are indicators of asset quality within the credit card and other consumer portfolio. 

The following table reflects the amortized cost basis by year of origination and refreshed FICO scores for 

consumer real estate loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Within consumer real estate, classes include HELOC and real estate installment loans. HELOCs are loans which during their draw period are classified as revolving loans. Once the draw period ends and the loan enters its repayment period, the loan converts to a term loan and is classified as a revolving loan converted to a term loan. All loans classified in the following table as revolving loans or revolving loans converted to term loans are HELOCs. Real estate installment loans are originated as fixed term loans and are classified below in their vintage year. All loans in the following tables classified in a vintage year are real estate installment loans.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or on a case-by-case basis if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccrual are loans for which FHN continues to receive payments including 

residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. 

Past due loans are loans contractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status. 

The following table reflects accruing and non-accruing loans and leases by class on December 31, 2023 and 2022:

(d) $ 10 million and $ 7 million of real estate installment loans are nonaccrual loans that have been specifically reviewed for impairment with no related allowance for 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Collateral-Dependent Loans 

Collateral-dependent loans are defined as loans for which repayment is expected to be derived substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. At a minimum, the estimated value of the collateral for each loan equals the current book value. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN had commercial loans with amortized cost of approximately $ 250 million and $ 124 million, respectively, that were based on the value of underlying collateral. Collateral-dependent C&#38;I and CRE loans totaled $ 117 million and $ 133 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The collateral for these loans generally consists of business assets including land, buildings, equipment and financial assets. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN recognized total charge-offs of approximately $ 144 million and $ 10 million, respectively, on these loans related to reductions in estimated collateral values. 

Consumer HELOC and real estate installment loans with amortized cost based on the value of underlying real 

estate collateral were approximately $ 6 million and $ 27 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and $ 7 million and $ 26 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Charge-offs were $ 1 million for collateral-dependent consumer loans during the year ended December 31, 2023, and $ 2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Loan Modifications to Troubled Borrowers 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when necessary to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Modifications could include extension of the maturity date, reductions of the interest rate, reduction or forgiveness of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. Combinations of these modifications may also be made for individual loans. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Principal reductions may be made in limited circumstances, typically for specific commercial loan workouts, and in the event of borrower bankruptcy.

Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. 

Troubled loans are considered those in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty can be subjective in nature and management&#8217;s judgment may be required in making this determination. FHN may determine that a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt, or if it is probable that a borrower may default in the foreseeable future absent a modification. Many aspects of a borrower&#8217;s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty. 

Troubled commercial loans are typically modified through forbearance agreements which could include reduced interest rates, reduced payments, term extension, or entering into short sale agreements. Principal reductions may occur in specific circumstances. 

Modifications for troubled consumer loans are generally structured using parameters of U.S. government-sponsored programs. For HELOC and real estate installment loans, troubled loans are typically modified by an interest rate reduction and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income 

ratio. Despite the absence of a loan modification by FHN, the discharge of personal liability through bankruptcy proceedings is considered a court-imposed modification. 

For the credit card portfolio, troubled loan modifications are typically enacted through either a short-term credit card hardship program or a longer-term credit card workout program. In the credit card hardship program, borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for six months to one year. In the credit card workout program, borrowers are granted a rate reduction to 0% and a term extension for up to five years.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Prior to January 1, 2023, a modification was classified as a TDR if the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and it was determined that FHN granted a concession to the borrower. Concessions represented modifications that FHN would not otherwise consider if a borrower had not been experiencing financial difficulty. Evaluation of whether a concession was granted, was subjective in nature and management&#8217;s judgment was required in making the determination of whether a modification was 

classified as a TDR. All non-reaffirmed residential real estate loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy were considered concessions and classified as nonaccruing TDRs. 

On December 31, 2022, FHN had $ 180 million of portfolio loans classified as TDRs. Additionally, $ 30 million of loans held for sale as of December 31, 2022 were classified as TDRs.

NOTE 4&#8212;ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ##TABLE_END

Note 4&#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses 

Management's estimate of expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, collectively referred to as the Allowance for Credit Losses, or the ACL. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of FHN's ACL methodology. 

The ACL is maintained at a level management believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. The determination of the ACL is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments considering a number of relevant underling factors, including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information. 

The expected loan losses are the product of multiplying FHN&#8217;s estimates of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and individual loan level exposure at default (EAD), including amortization and prepayment assumptions, on an undiscounted basis. FHN uses models or assumptions to develop the expected loss forecasts, which incorporate multiple macroeconomic forecasts over a four-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company immediately reverts to its historical loss averages, evaluated over the historical observation period, for the remaining estimated life of the loans. In order to capture the unique risks of the loan portfolio within the PD, LGD, and prepayment models, FHN segments the portfolio into pools, generally incorporating loan grades for commercial loans. As there can be no certainty that actual economic performance will precisely follow any specific macroeconomic forecast, FHN uses qualitative adjustments where current loan characteristics or current or forecasted economic conditions differ from historical periods. 

The evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group. As described in Note 3 - Loans and Leases, loans are grouped generally by product type and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using analytical or statistical models. The quantitative component utilizes economic forecast information as its foundation, and is primarily based on analytical models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. The ACL is also 

affected by qualitative factors that FHN considers to reflect current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in the quantitative calculations, including alternative economic forecasts. 

In accordance with its accounting policy elections, FHN does not recognize a separate allowance for expected credit losses for AIR and records reversals of AIR as reductions of interest income. FHN reverses previously accrued but uncollected interest when an asset is placed on nonaccrual status. AIR and the related allowance for expected credit losses is included as a component of other assets. The total amount of interest reversals from loans placed on nonaccrual status and the amount of income recognized on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were not material. 

Expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are estimated for periods where the commitment is not unconditionally cancellable. The measurement of expected credit losses for unfunded commitments mirrors that of loans and leases with the additional estimate of future draw rates (timing and amount). 

The increase in the ACL balance as of December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 largely reflects loan growth during the period, an evolving macroeconomic outlook, and modest grade migration. In developing credit loss estimates for its loan and lease portfolios, FHN utilized a baseline and a downside forecast scenario from Moody&#8217;s for its macroeconomic inputs. As of December 31, 2023, among other things, FHN's scenario selection process factored in the outlook for production, inflation, interest rates, employment, real estate prices, and international conflict. FHN selected one scenario as its base case, which was the Moody's baseline scenario. The heaviest weight was placed on this scenario. A smaller weight was placed on the FHN-selected downside scenario. 

Management also made qualitative adjustments to reflect estimated recoveries based on a review of prior charge off and recovery levels, for default risk associated with large balances with individual borrowers, for estimated loss amounts not reflected in historical factors due to specific portfolio risk, and for instances where limited data for acquired loans is considered to affect modeled results. 

The following table provides a rollforward of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio type for December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:

FHN had no aggregate undiscounted contractual obligations for lease arrangements that have not commenced as of December 31, 2023. 

First Horizon as Lessor 

As a lessor, FHN engages in the leasing of equipment to commercial clients primarily through direct financing and sales-type leases. Direct financing and sales-type leases are similar to other forms of installment lending in that lessors generally do not retain benefits and risks incidental to ownership of the property subject to leases. Such 

arrangements are essentially financing transactions that permit lessees to acquire and use property. As lessor, the sum of all minimum lease payments over the lease term and the estimated residual value, less unearned interest income, is recorded as the net investment in the lease on the commencement date and is included in loans and leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest income is accrued as earned over the term of the lease based on the net investment in leases. Fees incurred to originate the lease are deferred on the commencement date and recognized as an adjustment of the yield on the lease. 

FHN&#8217;s portfolio of direct financing and sales-type leases contains terms of 2 to 23 years, some of which contain options to extend the lease for various periods of time and/or to purchase the equipment subject to the lease at various points in time. These direct financing and sales-type leases typically include a payment structure set at lease inception and do not provide any additional services. Expenses associated with the leased equipment, such as maintenance and insurance, are paid by the lessee directly to third parties. The lease agreement typically contains an option for the purchase of the leased property by the lessee at the end of the lease term at either the property&#8217;s residual value or a specified price. In all cases, FHN expects to sell or re-lease the equipment at the end of the lease term. Due to the nature and structure of FHN&#8217;s direct financing and sales-type leases, there is no selling profit or loss on these transactions. 

The components of the Company&#8217;s net investment in leases as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

Note 6&#8212; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill 

FHN performed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023. The annual qualitative impairment test did not indicate impairment in any of FHN&#8217;s reporting units as of the testing date. Following the testing date, management evaluated the events and circumstances that could indicate that goodwill might be impaired and concluded that it is not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired. If there are any triggering events between annual periods, management will evaluate whether an impairment analysis is warranted. 

Accounting estimates and assumptions were made about FHN&#8217;s future performance and cash flows, as well as other prevailing market factors (e.g., interest rates, economic trends, etc.) when determining fair value as part of the goodwill impairment test. While management used the best information available to estimate future performance for each reporting unit, future adjustments to management&#8217;s projections may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates. 

The following is a summary of goodwill by reportable segment included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023:

Note 7&#8212; Mortgage Banking Activity 

FHN originates mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. These loans primarily consist of residential first lien mortgages that conform to standards established by GSEs that are major investors in U.S. home mortgages, but can also consist of junior lien and jumbo loans secured by residential property. These loans are primarily sold to private companies that are unaffiliated with the GSEs on a servicing-released basis. Gains and losses on these mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking and title income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

At December 31, 2023, FHN had approximately $ 34 million of loans that remained from pre-2009 mortgage business operations of legacy First Horizon. Activity related to the pre-2009 mortgage loans was primarily limited to payments and write-offs in 2023, 2022, and 2021, with no new originations or loan sales, and only an insignificant amount of repurchases. These loans are excluded from the disclosure below. 

The following table summarizes activity relating to residential mortgage loans held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

FHN records mortgage servicing rights at the lower of cost or market value and amortizes them over the remaining servicing life of the loans, with consideration given to prepayment assumptions. 

Mortgage servicing rights are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Mortgage servicing rights had the following carrying values as of the periods indicated in the table below.

In addition, there was an insignificant amount of non-mortgage and commercial servicing rights as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Total mortgage servicing fees included in mortgage banking and title income were $ 4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Mortgage servicing rights with a net carrying amount of $ 21 million were sold during 2022, resulting in a gain of $ 12 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 which is included in mortgage banking and title income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In conjunction with its acquisition of CBF, FHN obtained junior subordinated debentures, each of which is held by a wholly-owned trust that has issued trust preferred securities to external investors and loaned the funds to FHN as junior subordinated debt. The book value for each 

issuance represents the purchase accounting fair value as of the closing date less accumulated amortization of the associated discount, as applicable. Through various contractual arrangements, FHN assumed a full and unconditional guarantee for each trust&#8217;s obligations with respect to the securities. While the maturity dates are typically 30 years from the original issuance date, FHN has the option to redeem each of the junior subordinated debentures at par on any future interest payment date, which would trigger redemption of the related trust preferred securities. During 2021, FHN redeemed $ 94 million of legacy IBKC junior subordinated debt underlying multiple issuances of trust preferred securities. The redemption resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $ 26 million. A portion of FHN's remaining junior subordinated notes qualifies as Tier 2 capital under the risk-based capital guidelines.

The Series G Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into up to 4.9 % of the outstanding shares of FHN common stock in certain circumstances, including termination of the TD Merger Agreement. Because regulatory approval of the TD Transaction was not obtained, conversion occurred, effective June 26, 2023, at a fixed rate of 4,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, resulting in 19,742,776 additional common shares outstanding. 

The $ 494 million carrying value of the Series G Convertible Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2022 and qualified as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital upon conversion to common stock on June 26, 2023. 

Subsidiary Preferred Stock 

First Horizon Bank has issued 300,000 shares of Class A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Class A Preferred Stock) with a liquidation preference of $ 1,000 per share. Dividends on the Class A Preferred Stock, if declared, accrue and are payable each quarter, in arrears, at a floating rate equal to the greater of the three-month CME Term SOFR plus 1.11161 % ( 0.26161 % plus 0.85 %) or 3.75 % per annum. These securities qualify fully as Tier 1 capital for both First Horizon Bank and FHN. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, $ 295 million of Class A Preferred Stock 

was recognized as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

FT Real Estate Securities Company, Inc. (FTRESC), an indirect subsidiary of FHN, has issued 50 shares of 9.50 % Cumulative Preferred Stock, Class B (Class B Preferred Shares), with a liquidation preference of $ 1 million per share; of those shares, 47 were issued to nonaffiliates. FTRESC is a real estate investment trust established for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and managing real estate mortgage assets. Dividends on the Class B Preferred Shares are cumulative and are payable semi-annually. At December 31, 2023, the Class B Preferred Shares qualified as Tier 2 regulatory capital. For all periods presented, these securities are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as term borrowings. 

The Class B Preferred Shares are mandatorily redeemable on March 31, 2031, and redeemable at the discretion of FTRESC in the event that the Class B Preferred Shares cannot be accounted for as Tier 2 regulatory capital or there is more than an insubstantial risk that dividends paid with respect to the Class B Preferred Shares will not be fully deductible for tax purposes. 

LIBOR Change to SOFR 

On March 5, 2021, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that all tenors of LIBOR would cease publication or no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act was enacted in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides that LIBOR will transition to a replacement

benchmark based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus a spread adjustment, in such covered contracts. Subsequently, the FRB adopted Regulation ZZ that identified CME Term SOFR, a forward term rate based on SOFR administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd., plus a spread adjustment, as the replacement rate for securities for any interest rate calculations after June 30, 2023. 

On April 25, 2023, FHN announced that each reference to LIBOR in each applicable securities contract (which term includes preferred stock and related depositary shares) will transition to CME Term SOFR, plus a tenor-based spread adjustment, on the first business day after June 30, 2023 pursuant to the LIBOR Act and the implementing regulations. The information presented in this Note reflects that transition.

Note 12&#8212; Regulatory Capital and Restrictions 

Regulatory Capital 

FHN is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on FHN&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, FHN must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators such as capital components, asset risk weightings, and other factors. 

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, FHN and First Horizon Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. As of December 31, 2023, First Horizon Bank was classified as 

well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum Total Risk-Based, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 Leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to year-end that would change this designation. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require FHN to maintain minimum ratios as set forth in the following table. FHN and First Horizon Bank are also subject to a 2.5% capital conservation buffer which is an amount above the minimum levels designed to ensure that banks remain well-capitalized, even in adverse economic scenarios. 

The actual capital amounts and ratios of FHN and First Horizon Bank are presented in the following table.

Restrictions on cash and due from banks 

Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced its reserve requirement to zero, and as a result, on December 31, 2023 and 2022, First Horizon Bank was not required to maintain cash reserves. 

Restrictions on dividends 

Cash dividends are paid by FHN from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its subsidiaries. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of First Horizon Bank to transfer funds to FHN in the form of cash, dividends, loans, or advances. As of December 31, 2023, First Horizon Bank had undivided profits of $ 3.3 billion, of which a limited amount was available for distribution to FHN as dividends without prior regulatory approval. At any given time, the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow First Horizon Bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an amount equal to First Horizon Bank's retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year-to-date period. For any period, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s "retained net income" generally is equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by First Horizon Bank. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $ 1.2 billion at January 1, 2024. First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $ 220 million in 2023 and $ 435 million in 2022. During 2023 and 2022, First Horizon Bank declared and paid dividends on its preferred stock according to the payment terms of its issuances as noted in Note 11 - Preferred Stock. 

The payment of cash dividends by FHN and First Horizon Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 

Restrictions on intercompany transactions 

Under current Federal banking laws, First Horizon Bank may not enter into covered transactions with any affiliate including the parent company and certain financial subsidiaries in excess of 10 % of the bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, as defined, or $ 951 million, on December 31, 2023. Covered transactions include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or an investment in securities issued by an affiliate, and the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for any loan or extension of credit. The equity investment, including retained earnings, in certain of a bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries is also treated as a covered transaction. On December 31, 2023, the parent company had less than $ 1 million in covered transactions from First Horizon Bank and 840 Denning LLC, a parent company subsidiary, had a covered transaction of $ 2 million. Two of the bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries, FHN Financial Securities Corp. and First Horizon Advisors, Inc., had covered transactions from First Horizon Bank totaling $ 387 million and $ 50 million, respectively. In addition, the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates, as defined, is limited to 20 % of the bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, as defined, or $ 1.9 billion, on December 31, 2023. First Horizon Bank&#8217;s total covered transactions with all affiliates including the parent company on December 31, 2023 were $ 438 million.

As of December 31, 2023, FHN had net deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $ 32 million and $ 3 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates as follows: 

Table 8.14.4 

TAX CARRYFORWARD DTA EXPIRATION DATES

We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided an immaterial valuation allowance on the DTAs related to these state NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions change and we determine that we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance on DTAs will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. 

A DTA or DTL is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. In order to support the recognition of the DTA, FHN&#8217;s management must believe that the realization of the DTA is more likely than not. FHN evaluates the likelihood of realization of the DTA based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time, including (as appropriate) scheduled reversals of DTLs, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, 

and recent financial performance. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards attributable to the DTA. In projecting future taxable income, FHN incorporates assumptions including the estimated amount of future state and federal pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. 

As of December 31, 2023, FHN's net DTA was $ 215 million compared to $ 313 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, FHN's gross DTA (net of a valuation allowance) and gross DTL were $ 737 million and $ 522 million, respectively. Although realization is not assured, FHN believes that it meets the more-likely-than-not requirement with respect to the net DTA after valuation allowance.

(a) Tax effects of unrealized gains and losses are tracked on a security-by-security basis. 

Total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 15 million and $ 89 million, respectively. To the extent such unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 are subsequently recognized, $ 15 million of tax benefits could impact tax expense and FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate in future periods. 

During 2023, FHN settled audits which allowed it to reduce unrecognized benefits by $ 76 million, this resulted in a reduction of tax expense by $ 32 million. A reduction of accrued interest related to unrecognized benefits resulted in a reduction of tax expense of $ 14 million. 

It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state exposures could decrease by 

$ 1 million during 2024 if the applicable statutes of limitations expire as scheduled. FHN recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. FHN had approximately $ 3 million and $ 17 million accrued for the payment of interest as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2023 and 2022 were a benefit of $ 14 million and an expense of $ 3 million, respectively.

Note 16&#8212; Contingencies and Other Disclosures 

Contingencies 

Contingent Liabilities Overview 

Contingent liabilities arise in the ordinary course of business. Often they are related to lawsuits, arbitration, mediation, and other forms of litigation. Various litigation matters currently are threatened or pending against FHN and its subsidiaries. Also, FHN at times receives requests for information, subpoenas, or other inquiries from federal, state, and local regulators, from other government authorities, and from other parties concerning various matters relating to FHN&#8217;s current or former businesses. Certain matters of that sort are pending at most times, and FHN generally cooperates when those matters arise. Pending and threatened litigation matters sometimes are settled by the parties, and sometimes pending matters are resolved in court or before an arbitrator, or are withdrawn. Regardless of the manner of resolution, frequently the most significant changes in status of a matter occur over a short time period, often following a lengthy period of little substantive activity. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, or where claims or other actions may be possible but have not been brought, FHN cannot reasonably determine what the eventual outcome of the matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters may be, or what the eventual loss or impact related to each matter may be. FHN establishes a loss contingency liability for a litigation matter when loss is both probable and reasonably estimable as prescribed by applicable financial accounting guidance. If loss for a matter is probable and a range of possible loss outcomes is the best estimate available, accounting guidance requires a liability to be established at the low end of the range. 

Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with counsel, management is of the opinion that loss contingencies related to threatened or pending litigation matters should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of FHN, but may be material to FHN&#8217;s operating results for any particular reporting period depending, in part, on the results from that period. 

Material Loss Contingency Matters 

As used in this Note, except for matters that are reported as having been substantially settled or otherwise substantially resolved, FHN's &#8220;material loss contingency matters&#8221; generally fall into at least one of the following categories: (i) FHN has determined material loss to be probable and has established a material loss liability in accordance with applicable financial accounting guidance; 

(ii) FHN has determined material loss to be probable but is not reasonably able to estimate an amount or range of material loss liability; or (iii) FHN has determined that material loss is not probable but is reasonably possible, and the amount or range of that reasonably possible material loss is estimable. As defined in applicable accounting guidance, loss is reasonably possible if there is more than a remote chance of a material loss outcome for FHN. FHN provides contingencies note disclosures for certain pending or threatened litigation matters each quarter, including all matters mentioned in categories (i) or (ii) and, occasionally, certain matters mentioned in category (iii). In addition, in this Note, certain other matters, or groups of matters, are discussed relating to FHN&#8217;s pre-2009 mortgage origination and servicing businesses. In all litigation matters discussed in this Note, unless settled or otherwise resolved, FHN believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue those defenses vigorously. 

FHN reassesses the liability for litigation matters each quarter as the matters progress. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of liabilities established for all such loss contingency matters was $ 2 million. These liabilities are separate from those discussed under the heading Mortgage Loan Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability below. 

In each material loss contingency matter, except as otherwise noted, there is more than a remote chance that any of the following outcomes will occur: the plaintiff will substantially prevail; the defense will substantially prevail; the plaintiff will prevail in part; or the matter will be settled by the parties. At December 31, 2023, FHN estimates that for all material loss contingency matters, estimable reasonably possible losses in future periods in excess of currently established liabilities could aggregate in a range from zero to less than $ 1 million. 

As a result of the general uncertainties discussed above and the specific uncertainties discussed for each matter mentioned below, it is possible that the ultimate future loss experienced by FHN for any particular matter may materially exceed the amount, if any, of currently established liability for that matter. 

Mortgage Loan Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage origination, sale, securitization and servicing businesses, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline, estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The active pipeline consists of mortgage loan repurchase and make-whole demands from loan purchasers or securitization participants, foreclosure/servicing demands from borrowers, and

certain related exposures. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. 

Based on currently available information and experience to date, FHN has evaluated its loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure, and certain related exposures and has accrued for losses of $ 16 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Accrued liabilities for FHN&#8217;s estimate of these obligations are reflected in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Charges/expense reversals to increase/decrease the liability are included within other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimates are based upon currently available information and fact patterns that exist as of each balance sheet date and could be subject to future changes. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of FHN&#8217;s liability. 

The most significant outstanding claim associated with FHN's pre-2009 business is a servicing indemnification claim asserted by Nationstar Mortgage LLC, currently doing business as "Mr. Cooper". Nationstar was the purchaser of FHN's mortgage servicing obligations and assets in 2013 and 2014 and was FHN's subservicer. Nationstar asserts several categories of indemnity obligations in connection with mortgage loans under the 

subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction. This matter currently is not in litigation, but litigation in the future is possible. FHN is unable to estimate an RPL range for this matter due to significant uncertainties regarding: the exact nature of each of Nationstar's claims and its position in respect of each; the number of, and the facts underlying, the claimed instances of indemnifiable events; the applicability of FHN's contractual indemnity covenants to those facts and events; and, in those cases where the facts and events might support an indemnity claim, whether any legal defenses, counterclaims, other counter-positions, or third-party claims might eliminate or reduce claims against FHN or their impact on FHN. 

Other Disclosures 

Indemnification Agreements and Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, FHN enters into indemnification agreements for legal proceedings against its directors and officers and standard representations and warranties for underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, contractual commitments, and various other business transactions or arrangements. 

The extent of FHN&#8217;s obligations under these agreements depends upon the occurrence of future events; therefore, it is not possible to estimate a maximum potential amount of payouts that could be required by such agreements.

Note 17&#8212; Retirement Plans and Other Employee Benefits 

Pension Plan 

FHN sponsors a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan to employees hired or re-hired on or before September 1, 2007. Pension benefits are based on years of service, average compensation near retirement or other termination, and estimated social security benefits at age 65 . Benefits under the plan are &#8220;frozen&#8221; so that years of service and compensation changes after 2012 do not affect the benefit owed. Minimum contributions are based upon actuarially determined amounts necessary to fund the total benefit obligation. Decisions to contribute to the plan are based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. FHN made a contribution of $ 6 million to the qualified pension plan in 2021, and no contributions were made in 2023 and 2022. Management does not currently anticipate that FHN will make a contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2024. 

FHN also maintains non-qualified plans including a supplemental retirement plan that covers certain employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan have been limited by tax rules. These other non-qualified plans are unfunded, and contributions to these plans cover all benefits paid under the non-qualified plans. Payments made under the non-qualified plans were $ 6 million for 2023. FHN anticipates making benefit payments under the non-qualified plans of $ 5 million in 2024. 

Savings Plan 

FHN provides all qualifying full-time employees with the opportunity to participate in FHN's tax qualified 401(k) savings plan. The qualified plan allows employees to defer receipt of earned salary, up to tax law limits, on a tax-advantaged basis. Accounts, which are held in trust, may be invested in a wide range of mutual funds and in FHN common stock. Up to tax law limits, FHN provides a 100 % match for the first 6 % of salary deferred, with company matching contributions invested according to a participant&#8217;s current investment election. Through a non-qualified savings restoration plan, FHN provides a restorative benefit to certain highly-compensated employees who participate in the savings plan and whose contribution elections are capped by tax limitations. 

FHN also provides &#8220;flexible dollars&#8221; to assist employees with the cost of annual benefits and/or allow the employee to contribute to his or her qualified savings plan account. These &#8220;flexible dollars&#8221; are pre-tax contributions and are based upon the employees&#8217; years of service and 

qualified compensation. Contributions made by FHN through the flexible benefits plan and the company matches were $ 48 million, $ 47 million, and $ 51 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

Other Employee Benefits 

FHN provides postretirement life insurance benefits to certain employees and also provides postretirement medical insurance benefits to retirement-eligible employees, including certain prescription drug benefits. The postretirement medical plan is contributory with FHN contributing a fixed amount for certain participants. 

Actuarial Assumptions 

FHN&#8217;s process for developing the long-term expected rate of return of pension plan assets is based on capital market exposure as the source of investment portfolio returns. Capital market exposure refers to the plan&#8217;s allocation of its assets to asset classes, which primarily represent fixed income investments. FHN also considers expectations for inflation, real interest rates, and various risk premiums based primarily on the historical risk premium for each asset class. The expected return is based upon a time horizon of 30 years. Given its funded status, the asset allocation strategy for the qualified pension plan utilizes fixed income instruments that closely match the estimated duration of payment obligations. 

The discount rates for the three years ended 2023 for pension and other benefits were determined by using a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to 30 years. The discount rates are selected based upon data specific to FHN&#8217;s plans and employee population. The bonds used to create the hypothetical yield curve were subjected to several requirements to ensure that the resulting rates were representative of the bonds that would be selected by management to fulfill the company&#8217;s funding obligations. In addition to the AA rating, only non-callable bonds were included. Each bond issue was required to have at least $ 300 million par outstanding so that each issue was sufficiently marketable. Finally, bonds more than two standard deviations from the average yield were removed. When selecting the discount rate, FHN matches the duration of high quality bonds with the duration of the obligations of the plan as of the measurement date. For all years presented, the measurement date of the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs was December 31. 

The actuarial assumptions used in the defined benefit pension plans and other employee benefit plans were as follows:

Since the benefits in the defined benefit pension plan are frozen, the rate of compensation increase has no effect on qualified pension benefits. 

FHN has one pension plan where participants' benefits are affected by interest crediting rates. The plan's projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and interest crediting rates for the respective years were as follows:

The long-term expected rate of return is applied to the market-related value of plan assets in determining the expected return on plan assets. FHN determines the market-related value of plan assets using a hybrid methodology which recognizes liability-hedging assets at current fair value while return-seeking assets use a 

calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over five years, as permitted by GAAP. 

FHN utilizes a spot rate approach which applies duration-specific rates from the full yield curve to estimated future benefit payments for the determination of interest cost.

(a) Variances in the actuarial (gain) loss are due to normal activity such as changes in discount rates, updates to participant demographic information and revisions to life expectancy assumptions. 

(b) Amounts represent settlements of certain retired participants in the qualified pension plan that occurred during the year. 

The projected benefit obligation for unfunded plans was as follows:

The qualified pension plan was underfunded by $ 13 million and overfunded by $ 4 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because of the pension freeze at the end of 2012, as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the pension benefit obligation is equivalent to the accumulated benefit obligation. FHN's funded post retirement plan was in an overfunded status as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Balances reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income on a pre-tax basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consist of:

FHN utilizes the minimum amortization method in determining the amount of actuarial gains or losses to include in plan expense. Under this approach, the net deferred actuarial gain or loss that exceeds a threshold is amortized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. The threshold is measured as the greater of: 10 % of a plan&#8217;s projected benefit obligation as of the beginning of the year or 10 % of the market related value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year. FHN amortizes actuarial gains and losses using the estimated average remaining life expectancy of the remaining participants since all participants are considered inactive due to the freeze. 

The following table provides detail on expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate:

Plan Assets 

FHN&#8217;s overall investment goal is to create, over the life of the pension plan and retiree medical plan, an adequate pool of sufficiently liquid assets to support the qualified pension benefit obligations to participants, retirees, and beneficiaries, as well as to partially support the medical obligations to retirees and beneficiaries. Thus, the qualified pension plan and retiree medical plan seek to achieve a level of investment return consistent with changes in projected benefit obligations. 

Qualified pension plan assets primarily consist of fixed income securities which include U.S. treasuries, corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, municipal bonds, and foreign bonds. Fixed income investments generally have long durations consistent with the estimated pension liabilities of FHN. This duration-matching strategy is intended to hedge substantially all of the plan&#8217;s risk associated with future benefit payments. Retiree medical funds are kept in short-term investments, primarily money market funds and mutual funds. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN did not have any significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets related to the pension plan or the retiree medical plan. 

The fair value of FHN&#8217;s pension plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, by asset category classified using the Fair Value measurement hierarchy, is shown in the table below. See Note 23 &#8211; Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for more details about fair value measurements.

New awards under the IP may be granted to any of FHN's directors, officers, or associates. The IP was approved by shareholders in April 2021. Most awards outstanding at year end were granted under predecessor plans which are no longer active. 

The IP authorizes a broad range of award types, including restricted shares, stock units, cash units, and stock options. Stock units may be paid in shares or cash, depending upon the terms of the award. The IP also authorizes the grant of stock appreciation rights, though no such grants have been made under the IP or recent predecessor plans. Unvested awards have service and/or performance conditions which must be met in order for the shares to vest. Awards generally have service-vesting conditions, meaning that the associate must remain employed by FHN for certain periods in order for the award to vest. Some outstanding awards also have performance conditions, and one outstanding award has performance conditions associated with FHN&#8217;s stock price. FHN operates the IP by establishing award programs, each of which is intended to cover a specific need. Programs are created, changed, or terminated as needs change. 

On December 31, 2023, there were 4,965,419 shares available for new awards under the IP. This includes the new/additional shares originally authorized under the IP along with shares underlying ECP awards that have been forfeited or canceled since the IP was approved by shareholders, net of shares underlying IP awards that are outstanding or have been paid. 

Service condition full-value awards 

Awards may be granted with service conditions only. In recent years, programs using these awards have included annual programs for executives and selected management associates, a mandatory deferral program for executives tied to annual bonuses earned, other mandatory or elective deferral programs, various retention programs, and special hiring-incentive situations. Details of the awards vary by program, but most are settled in shares at vesting rather than cash, and vesting generally begins no earlier than the third anniversary of grant and rarely extends beyond the fifth anniversary of grant. 

Performance condition awards 

Under FHN&#8217;s long-term incentive and corporate performance programs, performance stock units (PSUs) (executives) and cash units (selected management 

employees) are granted annually and vest only if predetermined performance measures are met. The measures are changed each year based on goals and circumstances prevailing at the time of grant. In recent years the performance periods have been three years , with service-vesting near the third anniversary of the grant. PSUs granted from 2014 to 2020 have a post-vest holding period of two years . PSUs granted after 2020 no longer have the 2-year holding period. Recent annual performance awards require pro-rated forfeiture (in relation to the maximum possible) for performance falling between a threshold level and a maximum. Performance awards sometimes are used to provide a narrow, targeted incentive to a single person or small group; one such award which includes a market performance condition to FHN&#8217;s CEO is discussed in the next paragraph. Of the annual program awards paid during 2023 or outstanding on December 31, 2023: the 2018, 2019 and 2020 units vested in 2021, 2022 and 2023 at the 133.3 %, 187.5 % and 187.5 % payout level, respectively, and remain in a two year post-vesting holding period; the three-year performance period of the 2021 units has ended but performance is measured relative to peers and has not yet been determined; and, the three-year performance periods for the 2022 and 2023 units have not ended. 

Market condition award 

In 2016, FHN made a special grant of performance stock units to FHN&#8217;s CEO seven year performance period. The award had no provision for pro-rated payment based on partial performance. The award&#8217;s performance goal was based on achievement of a specific level of total shareholder return during the performance period and vested in 2023. 

Director awards 

Non-employee directors receive cash and annual grants of service-conditioned stock units under a program approved by the board of directors. Director stock units granted vest in the year following the year of grant and settle in shares. In 2023 and 2022, each director received a base of $ 122,000 or prorated equivalent of stock units, representing a portion of their annual retainer. Prior to 2005, directors could elect to defer cash compensation in the form of discount-priced stock options, one of which remained outstanding at December 31, 2023, but has since expired.

(c) Includes 3,198,257 retention grants canceled in connection with the TD merger termination; replacement retention grants issued settle in cash upon vesting and are excluded from this disclosure. 

On December 31, 2023, there was $ 78 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years . The total grant date fair value of shares vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $ 32 million, $ 29 million, and $ 36 million, respectively. 

Stock option awards 

In 2021 FHN ended its only remaining stock option program, making only one grant related to a 2020 commitment. Options under that program, for executives, have service-vesting requirements and seven-year terms. 

In the past, option programs varied widely in their uses and terms, and many old-program options, granted under the ECP or its predecessor plans, remain outstanding today. All options granted since 2005 provide for the issuance of FHN common stock at a price fixed at its fair market value on the grant date. Except for converted options and a special retention stock option award to the CEO in 2016, all options granted since 2008 vest fully no 

later than the fourth anniversary of grant, and all such options expire seven years from the grant date. CBF converted options and IBKC converted options granted prior to November 3, 2019 (the merger agreement date) are fully vested and expire ten years from grant date. IBKC converted options granted subsequent to the merger agreement vest fully no later than the fifth anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years from grant date. The 2016 retention award vests beginning on the fourth anniversary of grant and extends through the sixth anniversary of grant. A deferral program, which was discontinued in 2005, allowed for foregone compensation plus the exercise price to equal the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant if the grantee agreed to receive the options in lieu of compensation. Deferral options still outstanding expire 20 years from the grant date. At December 31, 2023 an immaterial number of grants remained outstanding, but have since expired. 

The summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023, is shown below:

FHN did not grant or convert stock options in 2023 and 2022. FHN granted or converted 155,124 stock options with a weighted average fair value of $ 3.39 per option at grant date in 2021. 

FHN used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted or converted in 2021 and with the following assumptions: 

Table 8.18.3 

STOCK OPTION FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS 

##TABLE_START 2021 Expected dividend yield 4.16 % Expected weighted-average lives of options granted 6.29 years Expected weighted-average volatility 38.44 % Expected volatility range 37.86 % - 39.02 % 

Risk-free interest rate 0.62 % ##TABLE_END

Expected lives of options granted are determined based on the vesting period, historical exercise patterns and contractual term of the options. FHN uses a blend of historical and implied volatility in determining expected volatility. A portion of the weighted average volatility rate is derived by compiling daily closing stock prices over a historical period approximating the expected lives of the options. Additionally, because of market volatility due to economic conditions and the impact on stock prices of financial institutions, FHN also incorporates a measure of implied volatility so as to incorporate more recent market conditions in the estimation of future volatility. 

Phantom stock awards 

As a result of the IBKC merger, FHN assumed phantom stock awards under various plans to officers and other key associates. The awards are subject to a vesting period of five years and are paid out in cash upon vesting. The amount paid per vesting period is calculated as the number of vested share equivalents multiplied by closing market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the vesting date. Share equivalents are calculated on the date of grant as the total award's dollar value divided by the closing market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the grant date. As of December 31, 2023, there were 199,114 share equivalents of phantom stock awards outstanding. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies for more discussion on FHN's phantom stock awards. 

Compensation Cost 

The compensation cost that has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income pertaining to stock-based awards was $ 36 million, $ 75 million, and $ 43 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The corresponding total income tax benefits recognized were $ 8 million, $ 18 million and $ 10 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

Authorization 

Consistent with Tennessee state law, only authorized, but unissued, stock may be utilized in connection with any issuance of FHN common stock which may be required as a result of stock-based compensation awards. Prior authorizations to repurchase shares issued in connection with compensation plans expired on December 31, 2023. After 2023, as authorized by FHN's Board and the Board's Compensation Committee, FHN will continue to make automatic stock purchases by withholding shares associated with stock-based awards to cover tax obligations associated with those awards. Those limited, off-market purchases no longer will be connected to a traditional, announced purchase program. As has been true in the past, automatic tax withholding purchases are not subject to trading blackouts which affect senior executives or the general purchase program. 

Dividend reinvestment plan 

Prior to March 2022, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan authorized the sale of FHN&#8217;s common stock from stock acquired on the open market to shareholders who choose to invest all or a portion of their cash dividends or make optional cash payments of $ 25 to $ 10,000 per quarter without paying commissions. The price of stock purchased on the open market was the average price paid. In March 2022, FHN agreed to suspend the Dividend Reinvestment Plan in connection with the TD Transaction. During the suspension period, dividend payments of FHN are not automatically reinvested in additional shares of FHN common stock and participants in the Plan are not able to purchase shares of FHN common stock through optional cash investments under the Plan.

Note 19&#8212; Business Segment Information 

FHN's operating segments are composed of the following: 

&#8226; Regional Banking segment offers financial products and services, including traditional lending and deposit taking, to commercial and consumer clients primarily in the southern U.S. and other selected markets. Regional Banking also provides investment, wealth management, financial planning, trust and asset management services for consumer clients. 

&#8226; Specialty Banking segment consists of lines of business that deliver product offerings and services with specialized industry knowledge. Specialty Banking&#8217;s lines of business include asset-based lending, mortgage warehouse lending, commercial real estate, franchise finance, correspondent banking, equipment finance, mortgage, and (prior to July 2022) title insurance. In addition to traditional lending and deposit taking, Specialty Banking also delivers treasury management solutions, loan syndications, and international banking. Additionally, Specialty Banking has a line of business focused on fixed income securities sales, trading, underwriting, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad, as well as loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales. 

&#8226; Corporate segment consists primarily of corporate support functions including risk management, audit, accounting, finance, executive office, and corporate communications. Shared support services such as 

human resources, properties, technology, credit risk and bank operations are allocated to the activities of Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. Additionally, the Corporate segment includes centralized management of capital and funding to support the business activities of the company including management of wholesale funding, liquidity, and capital management and allocation. The Corporate segment also includes the revenue and expense associated with run-off businesses such as pre-2009 mortgage banking elements, run-off consumer and trust preferred loan portfolios, and other exited businesses. 

Periodically, FHN adapts its segments to reflect managerial or strategic changes. FHN may also modify its methodology of allocating expenses and equity among segments which could change historical segment results. Business segment revenue, expense, asset, and equity levels reflect those which are specifically identifiable or which are allocated based on an internal allocation method. Because the allocations are based on internally developed assignments and allocations, to an extent they are subjective. Generally, all assignments and allocations have been consistently applied for all periods presented.

NOTE 20&#8212;VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES ##TABLE_END

Note 20&#8212; Variable Interest Entities 

FHN makes equity investments in various entities that are considered VIEs, as defined by GAAP. A VIE typically does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The Company&#8217;s variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity's net assets. FHN consolidates a VIE if FHN is the primary beneficiary of the entity. FHN is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if FHN's variable interest provides it with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and the right to receive benefits (or the obligation to absorb losses) that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest held could potentially be significant to the VIE, FHN considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE. FHN assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. 

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 

FHN has established certain rabbi trusts related to deferred compensation plans offered to its employees. FHN contributes employee cash compensation deferrals to the trusts and directs the underlying investments made by the trusts. The assets of these trusts are available to FHN&#8217;s creditors only in the event that FHN becomes insolvent. These trusts are considered VIEs as there is no equity at risk in the trusts since FHN provided the equity interest to its employees in exchange for services rendered. FHN is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trusts as it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the rabbi trusts through its ability to direct the underlying investments made by the trusts. Additionally, FHN could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the trusts due to its right to receive any asset values in excess of liability payoffs and its obligation to fund any liabilities to employees that are in excess of a rabbi trust&#8217;s assets. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of assets and liabilities associated with rabbi trusts used for deferred compensation plans which are consolidated by FHN as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities 

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

Through designated wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Horizon Bank makes equity investments as a limited partner in various partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to support FHN&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives. LIHTC partnerships are managed by unrelated general partners that have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the partnerships. FHN is therefore not the primary beneficiary of any LIHTC partnerships. Accordingly, FHN does not consolidate these VIEs and accounts for these investments in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

FHN accounts for all qualifying LIHTC investments under the proportional amortization method. Under this method an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance as a component of income tax expense. LIHTC investments that do not qualify for the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Expenses associated with non-qualifying LIHTC investments were not material during 2023, 2022, and 2021. 

The following table summarizes the impact to income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 for LIHTC investments accounted for under the proportional amortization method.

Other Tax Credit Investments 

Through designated subsidiaries, First Horizon Bank periodically makes equity investments as a non-managing member in various LLCs that sponsor community development projects utilizing the NMTC. First Horizon Bank also makes equity investments as a limited partner or non-managing member in entities that receive historic tax credits. The purposes of these investments are to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to support FHN&#8217;s community reinvestment initiatives. These entities

are considered VIEs as First Horizon Bank's subsidiaries represent the holders of the equity investment at risk, but do not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of the entities. 

Small Issuer Trust Preferred Holdings 

First Horizon Bank holds variable interests in trusts which have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (&#8220;trust preferreds&#8221;) for smaller banking and insurance enterprises. First Horizon Bank has no voting rights for the trusts&#8217; activities. The trusts&#8217; only assets are junior subordinated debentures of the issuing enterprises. The creditors of the trusts hold no recourse to the assets of First Horizon Bank. Since First Horizon Bank is solely a holder of the trusts&#8217; securities, it has no rights which would give it the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts&#8217; economic performance and thus it is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. 

On-Balance Sheet Trust Preferred Securitization 

In 2007, First Horizon Bank executed a securitization of certain small issuer trust preferreds for which the underlying trust meets the definition of a VIE, as the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance. Since First Horizon Bank did not retain servicing or other decision-making rights, First Horizon Bank is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust&#8217;s economic performance. Accordingly, First Horizon Bank has accounted for the funds received through the securitization as a term borrowing in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trust. 

Holdings in Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities 

FHN holds securities issued by various Agency securitization trusts. Based on their restrictive nature, the trusts meet the definition of a VIE since the holders of the equity investments at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance. FHN could potentially receive benefits or absorb losses that are significant to the trusts based on the nature of the trusts&#8217; activities and the size of FHN&#8217;s 

holdings. However, FHN is solely a holder of the trusts&#8217; securities and does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts&#8217; economic performance and is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. FHN has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. 

Commercial Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

For certain troubled commercial loans, First Horizon Bank modifies the terms of the borrower&#8217;s debt in an effort to increase the probability of receipt of amounts contractually due. Following a modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, the borrower entity typically meets the definition of a VIE as the initial determination of whether an entity is a VIE must be reconsidered as events have proven that the entity&#8217;s equity is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or a restructuring of the terms of its financing. As First Horizon Bank does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such troubled commercial borrowers&#8217; operations, it is not considered the primary beneficiary even in situations where, based on the size of the financing provided, First Horizon Bank is exposed to potentially significant benefits and losses of the borrowing entity. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the borrowing entities beyond certain funding commitments established upon restructuring of the terms of the debt that allows for preparation of the underlying collateral for sale. 

Proprietary Trust Preferred Issuances 

In conjunction with its acquisitions, FHN acquired junior subordinated debt underlying multiple issuances of trust preferred debt. All of the trusts are considered VIEs because the ownership interests from the capital contributions to these trusts are not considered &#8220;at risk&#8221; in evaluating whether the holders of the equity investments at risk in the trusts have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance. Thus, FHN cannot be the trusts&#8217; primary beneficiary because its ownership interests in the trusts are not considered variable interests as they are not considered &#8220;at risk&#8221;. Consequently, none of the trusts are consolidated by FHN.

Note 21&#8212; Derivatives 

In the normal course of business, FHN utilizes various financial instruments (including derivative contracts and credit-related agreements) through its fixed income and risk management operations, as part of its risk management strategy and as a means to meet clients&#8217; needs. Derivative instruments are subject to credit and market risks in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet as required by GAAP. The contractual or notional amounts of these financial instruments do not necessarily represent the amount of credit or market risk. However, they can be used to measure the extent of involvement in various types of financial instruments. Controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated. The ALCO controls, coordinates, and monitors the usage and effectiveness of these financial instruments. 

Credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur if a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. The measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value. FHN manages credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions through national exchanges, primary dealers or approved counterparties, and by using mutual margining and master netting agreements whenever possible to limit potential exposure. FHN also maintains collateral posting requirements with certain counterparties to limit credit risk. Daily margin posted or received with central clearinghouses is considered a legal settlement of the related derivative contracts which results in a net presentation for each contract in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Treatment of daily margin as a settlement has no effect on hedge accounting or gains/losses for the applicable derivative contracts. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, FHN had $ 406 million and $ 159 million of cash receivables and $ 33 million and $ 42 million of cash payables related to collateral posting under master netting arrangements, inclusive of collateral posted related to contracts with adjustable collateral posting thresholds and over-collateralized positions, with derivative counterparties. With exchange-traded contracts, the credit risk is limited to the clearinghouse used. For non-exchange traded instruments, credit risk may occur when there is a gain in the fair value of the financial instrument and the counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of the contract and/or when the collateral proves to be of insufficient value. See additional discussion regarding master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements later in this note under the heading &#8220;Master Netting and Similar Agreements.&#8221; Market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in interest rates or the prices of debt instruments. FHN manages market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. 

FHN continually measures this risk through the use of models that measure value-at-risk and earnings-at-risk. 

Derivative Instruments 

FHN enters into various derivative contracts both to facilitate client transactions and as a risk management tool. Where contracts have been created for clients, FHN enters into upstream transactions with dealers to offset its risk exposure. Contracts with dealers that require central clearing are novated to a clearing agent who becomes FHN&#8217;s counterparty. Derivatives are also used as a risk management tool to hedge FHN&#8217;s exposure to changes in interest rates or other defined market risks. 

Forward contracts are over-the-counter contracts where two parties agree to purchase and sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument at a specified price, with delivery or settlement at a specified date. Futures contracts are exchange-traded contracts where two parties agree to purchase and sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument at a specified price, with delivery or settlement at a specified date. Interest rate option contracts give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified quantity of a financial instrument, at a specified price, during a specified period of time. Caps and floors are options that are linked to a notional principal amount and an underlying indexed interest rate. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest payments at specified intervals between two parties without the exchange of any underlying principal. Swaptions are options on interest rate swaps that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a specified period of time. 

Trading Activities 

FHNF trades U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, government-guaranteed loan, mortgage-backed, corporate and municipal fixed income securities, and other securities for distribution to clients. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts. FHNF also enters into interest rate contracts, including caps, swaps, and floors, for its clients. In addition, FHNF enters into futures and option contracts to economically hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of its securities inventory. These transactions are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in noninterest income. Related assets and liabilities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as derivative assets and derivative liabilities within other assets and other liabilities. The FHNF Risk Committee and the Credit Risk Management Committee collaborate to mitigate credit risk related to these transactions. Credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, risk control limits, and ongoing monitoring procedures. Total trading revenues were $ 97 million, $ 157 million and $ 360 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Trading revenues are inclusive of both

Interest Rate Risk Management 

FHN&#8217;s ALCO focuses on managing market risk by controlling and limiting earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk exists to the extent that interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have different maturity or repricing characteristics. FHN uses derivatives, primarily swaps, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Interest paid or received for swaps utilized by FHN to hedge the fair value of long-term debt is recognized as an adjustment of the interest expense of the liabilities whose risk is being managed. FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk management policy is to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk or market value of assets or liabilities, 

not to speculate. In addition, FHN has entered into certain interest rate swaps and caps as a part of a product offering to commercial clients that includes customer derivatives paired with upstream offsetting market instruments that, when completed, are designed to mitigate interest rate risk. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are measured at fair value with gains or losses included in current earnings in noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash Flow Hedges 

Prior to 2021, FHN entered into pay floating, receive fixed interest rate swaps designed to manage its exposure to the variability in cash flows related to interest payments on debt instruments. The debt instruments primarily consist of held-to-maturity commercial loans that have variable interest payments that historically were based on 1-month LIBOR. In second quarter 2023, the remaining hedge was revised to reference 1-month Term SOFR after the cessation of LIBOR-based cash flows. In conjunction with the IBKC merger, FHN acquired interest rate contracts (floors and collars) which were re-designated as cash flow hedges. The debt instruments associated with these hedges also primarily consisted of held-to-maturity commercial loans that had variable interest payments that were based on 1-month LIBOR. The last hedge acquired in conjunction with the IBKC merger matured in second quarter 2023. 

In 2022, FHN entered into interest rate contracts (floors and swaps) which have been designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges reference 1-month Term SOFR and FHN has made certain elections under ASU 2020-04 to facilitate qualification for hedge accounting during the time that hedged items transition away from 1-Month LIBOR. 

In a cash flow hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified from OCI to current period earnings (interest income or interest expense) in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings.

FHN has mortgage banking operations that include the origination and sale of loans into the secondary market. As part of the origination of loans, FHN enters into interest rate lock commitments with borrowers. Additionally, FHN enters into forward sales contracts with buyers for 

delivery of loans at a future date. Both of these contracts qualify as freestanding derivatives and are recognized at fair value through earnings. The notional and fair values of these contracts are presented in the table below.

B shares were $ 23 million and $ 27 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN recognized $ 15 million and $ 22 million, respectively, in derivative valuation adjustments related to prior sales of Visa Class B shares. See Note 23 - Fair Value of Assets and

Liabilities for discussion of the valuation inputs and processes for these Visa-related derivatives. 

FHN utilizes cross currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated loans. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, these loans were valued at $ 17 million and $ 9 million, respectively. The balance sheet amount and the gains/losses associated with these derivatives were not significant. 

Related to its loan participation/syndication activities, FHN enters into risk participation agreements, under which it assumes exposure for, or receives indemnification for, borrowers&#8217; performance on underlying interest rate derivative contracts. FHN&#8217;s counterparties in these contracts are other lending institutions involved in the loan participation/syndication arrangements for which the underlying interest rate derivative contract is intended to hedge interest rate risk for the borrower. FHN will make (other institution is the lead bank) or receive (FHN is the lead bank) payments for risk participations if the borrower defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of its interest rate derivative agreement with the lead bank in the participation. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the notional values of FHN&#8217;s risk participations were $ 351 million and $ 242 million of derivative assets and $ 874 million and $ 742 million of derivative liabilities, respectively. The notional value for risk participation/syndication agreements is consistent with the percentage of participation in the lending arrangement. FHN&#8217;s maximum exposure or benefit in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate derivative contracts for which the borrower is in a liability position at the time of default. FHN monitors the credit risk associated with the borrowers to which the risk participations relate through the same credit risk assessment process utilized for establishing credit loss estimates for its loan portfolio. These credit risk estimates are included in the determination of fair value for the risk participations. Assuming all underlying third party customers referenced in the swap contracts defaulted at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the exposure from these agreements would not be material based on the fair value of the underlying swaps. 

FHN holds certain certificates of deposit with the rate of return based on an equity index which is considered an embedded derivative as a written option that must be separately recognized. The risks of the written option are offset by purchasing an option with terms that mirror the written option, which is also carried at fair value on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN had recognized an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities associated with these contracts. 

Master Netting and Similar Agreements 

FHN uses master netting agreements, mutual margining agreements and collateral posting requirements to minimize credit risk on derivative contracts. Master netting and similar agreements are used when counterparties have multiple derivatives contracts that allow for a &#8220;right of setoff,&#8221; meaning that a counterparty may net offsetting positions and collateral with the same counterparty under the contract to determine a net receivable or payable. The following discussion provides an overview of these arrangements which may vary due to the derivative type and market in which a derivative transaction is executed. 

Interest rate derivatives are subject to agreements consistent with standard agreement forms of the ISDA. Currently, all interest rate derivative contracts are entered into as over-the-counter transactions and collateral posting requirements are based on the net asset or liability position with each respective counterparty. For contracts that require central clearing, novation to a counterparty with access to a clearinghouse occurs and initial margin is posted. 

Cash margin received (posted) that is considered settlements for the derivative contracts is included in the respective derivative asset (liability) value. Cash margin that is considered collateral received (posted) for interest rate derivatives is recognized as a liability (asset) on FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Interest rate derivatives with clients that are smaller financial institutions typically require posting of collateral by the counterparty to FHN. This collateral is subject to a threshold with daily adjustments based upon changes in the level or fair value of the derivative position. Positions and related collateral can be netted in the event of default. Collateral pledged by a counterparty is typically cash or securities. The securities pledged as collateral are not recognized within FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest rate derivatives associated with lending arrangements share the collateral with the related loan(s). The derivative and loan positions may be netted in the event of default. For disclosure purposes, the entire collateral amount is allocated to the loan. 

Interest rate derivatives with larger financial institutions typically contain provisions whereby the collateral posting thresholds under the agreements adjust based on the credit ratings of both counterparties. If the credit rating of FHN and/or First Horizon Bank is lowered, FHN could be required to post additional collateral with the counterparties. Conversely, if the credit rating of FHN and/or First Horizon Bank is increased, FHN could have collateral released and be required to post less collateral in the future. Also, if a counterparty&#8217;s credit ratings were to decrease, FHN and/or First Horizon Bank could require the posting of additional collateral; whereas if a counterparty&#8217;s credit ratings were to increase, the

counterparty could require the release of excess collateral. Collateral for these arrangements is adjusted daily based on changes in the net fair value position with each counterparty. 

The net fair value, determined by individual counterparty, of all derivative instruments with adjustable collateral posting thresholds was $ 12 million of assets and $ 188 million of liabilities on December 31, 2023, and $ 5 million of assets and $ 268 million of liabilities on December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN had received collateral of $ 95 million and $ 106 million and posted collateral of $ 83 million and $ 61 million, respectively, in the normal course of business related to these agreements. 

Certain agreements also contain accelerated termination provisions, inclusive of the right of offset, if a counterparty&#8217;s credit rating falls below a specified level. If a counterparty&#8217;s debt rating (including FHN&#8217;s and First Horizon Bank's) were to fall below these minimums, these provisions would be triggered, and the counterparties could terminate the agreements and require immediate settlement of all derivative contracts under the agreements. The net fair value, determined by individual counterparty, of all interest rate derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent accelerated termination provisions was $ 12 million of assets and $ 188 million of liabilities on December 31, 2023, and $ 378 million of assets and $ 268 million of liabilities on 

December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, FHN had received collateral of $ 95 million and $ 479 million and posted collateral of $ 83 million and $ 61 million, respectively, in the normal course of business related to these contracts. 

FHNF buys and sells various types of securities for its clients. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts, and are generally not subject to master netting agreements. For futures and options, FHN transacts through a third party, and the transactions are subject to margin and collateral maintenance requirements. In the event of default, open positions can be offset along with the associated collateral. 

For this disclosure, FHN considers the impact of master netting and other similar agreements which allow FHN to settle all contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative asset or liability position with the related securities and cash collateral. The application of the collateral cannot reduce the net derivative asset or liability position below zero, and therefore any excess collateral is not reflected in the following tables. 

The following table provides details of derivative assets and collateral received as presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Note 22&#8212; Master Netting and Similar Agreements &#8211; Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, and Securities Borrowing Transactions 

For repurchase, reverse repurchase and securities borrowing transactions, FHN and each counterparty have the ability to offset all open positions and related collateral in the event of default. Due to the nature of these transactions, the value of the collateral for each transaction approximates the value of the corresponding receivable or payable. For repurchase agreements through FHN&#8217;s fixed income business (securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase), transactions are collateralized by securities and/or government guaranteed loans which are delivered on the settlement date and are maintained throughout the term of the transaction. For FHN&#8217;s repurchase agreements through banking activities (securities sold under agreements to repurchase), securities are typically pledged at settlement and not released until maturity. For asset positions, the collateral is not included on FHN&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For liability positions, securities collateral pledged by FHN is generally represented within FHN&#8217;s trading or available-for-sale securities portfolios. 

For this disclosure, FHN considers the impact of master netting and other similar agreements that allow FHN to settle all contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net asset or liability position with the related securities collateral. The application of the collateral cannot reduce the net asset or liability position below zero, and therefore any excess collateral is not reflected in the tables below. 

Securities purchased under agreements to resell is included in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase is included in short-term borrowings. 

The following table provides details of securities purchased under agreements to resell and collateral pledged by counterparties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Note 23&#8212; Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 

FHN groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. This hierarchy requires FHN to maximize the use of observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Each fair value measurement is placed into the proper level based on the lowest level of significant input. These levels are: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8212;Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8212;Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices 

for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8212;Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect management&#8217;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

From time to time, FHN may be required to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or market (LOCOM) accounting or write-downs of individual assets. For assets 

measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis which were still held on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the following table provides the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment and the related carrying value.

(b) Represents the fair value and related losses of foreclosed properties that were measured subsequent to their initial classification as OREO. Balance excludes OREO related to government-insured mortgages. 

(c) Represents tax credit investments accounted for under the equity method. 

Lease asset impairments recognized represent the reduction in value of the right-of-use assets associated with leases that are being exited in advance of the contractual lease expiration. 

Impairments are measured using a discounted cash flow methodology, which is considered a Level 3 valuation. 

Impairments of long-lived tangible assets reflect locations where the associated land and building are either owned 

or leased. The fair values of owned sites were determined using estimated sales prices from appraisals and broker opinions less estimated costs to sell with adjustments upon final disposition. The fair values of owned assets in leased sites (e.g., leasehold improvements) were determined using a discounted cash flow approach, based on the revised estimated useful lives of the related assets. Both measurement methodologies are considered Level 3 valuations. Impairment adjustments recognized upon disposition of a location are considered Level 2 valuations.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, FHN recognized leased asset impairments of $ 1 million and fixed asset impairments were immaterial . Both fixed asset and leased asset impairments were immaterial for 2022. In 2021, FHN recognized $ 34 million of fixed asset impairments and $ 3 million of leased asset impairments. These 

impairments were primarily related to acquisition integration efforts associated with reduction of leased office space and banking center optimization. These amounts were primarily recognized in the Corporate segment.

Trading Securities - SBA interest-only strips 

Increases (decreases) in estimated prepayment rates and bond equivalent yields negatively (positively) affect the value of SBA interest-only strips. Management additionally considers whether the loans underlying related SBA interest-only strips are delinquent, in default or prepaying, and adjusts the fair value down 20 - 100% depending on the length of time in default. SBA interest-only strips were transferred from AFS to trading securities on October 1, 2021. 

Loans held for sale 

Foreclosure losses and prepayment rates are significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of FHN&#8217;s residential real estate loans held for sale. Loss severity trends are also assessed to evaluate the reasonableness of fair value estimates resulting from discounted cash flows methodologies as well as to estimate fair value for newly repurchased loans and loans that are near foreclosure. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements. All observable and unobservable inputs are re-assessed quarterly. 

Increases (decreases) in estimated prepayment rates and bond equivalent yields negatively (positively) affect the value of unguaranteed interests in SBA loans. Unguaranteed interest in SBA loans held for sale are carried at less than the outstanding balance due to credit risk estimates. Credit risk adjustments may be reduced if prepayment is likely or as consistent payment history is realized. Management also considers other factors such as delinquency or default and adjusts the fair value accordingly. 

FHN historically had a portion of mortgage loans held for investment for which the fair value option was elected upon origination and which were accounted for at fair value. This portion of mortgage loans held for investment at fair value option was transferred to the loans held for sale portfolio on April 1, 2021. 

Derivative liabilities 

In conjunction with pre-2020 sales of Visa Class B shares, FHN and the purchasers entered into derivative transactions whereby FHN will make, or receive, cash payments whenever the conversion ratio of the Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is adjusted. FHN uses a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of FHN&#8217;s derivative liabilities associated with its prior sales of Visa Class B shares. The methodology includes estimation of both the resolution amount for Visa&#8217;s Covered Litigation matters as well as the length of time until the resolution occurs. Significant increases (decreases) in either of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair value measurements for the derivative liabilities. Additionally, 

FHN performs a probability weighted multiple resolution scenario to calculate the estimated fair value of these derivative liabilities. Assignment of higher (lower) probabilities to the larger potential resolution scenarios would result in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities. Since this estimation process requires application of judgment in developing significant unobservable inputs used to determine the possible outcomes and the probability weighting assigned to each scenario, these derivatives have been classified within Level 3 in fair value measurements disclosures. 

Loans and leases and Other Real Estate Owned 

Collateral-dependent loans and OREO are primarily valued using appraisals based on sales of comparable properties in the same or similar markets. Other collateral (receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is valued through borrowing base certificates, financial statements and/or auction valuations. These valuations are discounted based on the quality of reporting, knowledge of the marketability/collectability of the collateral and historical disposition rates. 

Other assets &#8211; tax credit investments 

The estimated fair value of tax credit investments accounted for under the equity method is generally determined in relation to the yield (i.e., future tax credits to be received) an acquirer of these investments would expect in relation to the yields experienced on current new issue and/or secondary market transactions. Thus, as tax credits are recognized, the future yield to a market participant is reduced, resulting in consistent impairment of the individual investments. Individual investments are reviewed for impairment quarterly, which may include the consideration of additional marketability discounts related to specific investments which typically includes consideration of the underlying property&#8217;s appraised value. 

Fair Value Option 

FHN previously elected the fair value option on a prospective basis for substantially all types of mortgage loans originated for sale purposes except for mortgage origination operations which utilize the platform acquired from CBF. FHN determined that the election reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of such loans with changes in the value of derivatives and forward delivery commitments used as economic hedges for these assets at the time of election. 

Repurchased loans relating to mortgage banking operations conducted prior to the IBKC merger are recognized within loans held for sale at fair value at the time of repurchase, which includes consideration of the credit status of the loans and the estimated liquidation value. FHN has elected to continue recognition of these loans at fair value in periods subsequent to reacquisition. Due to the credit-distressed nature of the vast majority of 

##TABLE_START

repurchased loans and the related loss severities experienced upon repurchase, FHN believes that the fair value election provides a more timely recognition of changes in value for these loans that occur subsequent to repurchase. Absent the fair value election, these loans would be subject to valuation at the LOCOM value, which would prevent subsequent values from exceeding the initial fair value, determined at the time of repurchase, 

but would require recognition of subsequent declines in value. Thus, the fair value election provides for a more timely recognition of any potential future recoveries in asset values while not affecting the requirement to recognize subsequent declines in value. 

The following table reflects the differences between the fair value carrying amount of residential real estate loans held for sale and held for investment measured at fair value in accordance with management&#8217;s election and the aggregate unpaid principal amount FHN is contractually entitled to receive at maturity.

Assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value election are initially measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Such changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities for which FHN elected the fair value option are included in current period earnings with classification in the income statement line item reflected in the following table:

For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the amount for residential real estate loans held for sale included an insignificant amount of gains in pre-tax earnings that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. The portion of the fair value adjustments related to credit risk was determined based on estimated default rates and estimated loss severities. Interest income on residential real estate loans held for 

sale measured at fair value is calculated based on the note rate of the loan and is recorded in the interest income section of the Consolidated Statements of Income as interest on loans held for sale.

transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following describes the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and for estimating the fair value of financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed. 

Short-term financial assets 

Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions and the Federal Reserve are carried at historical cost. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization. 

Trading securities and trading liabilities 

Trading securities and trading liabilities are recognized at fair value through current earnings. Trading inventory held for broker-dealer operations is included in trading securities and trading liabilities. Broker-dealer long positions are valued at bid price in the bid-ask spread. Short positions are valued at the ask price. Inventory positions are valued using observable inputs including current market transactions, benchmark yields, credit spreads, and consensus prepayment speeds. Trading loans are valued using observable inputs including current market transactions, swap rates, mortgage rates, and consensus prepayment speeds. 

Trading securities - SBA interest-only strips 

Interest-only strips are valued at elected fair value based on an income approach using an internal valuation model. The internal valuation model includes assumptions regarding projections of future cash flows, prepayment rates, default rates and interest-only strip terms. These securities bear the risk of loan prepayment or default that may result in FHN not recovering all or a portion of its recorded investment. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors including default or prepayment status of the underlying SBA loans. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and may change in the near term. SBA interest-only strips were transferred from AFS to trading on October 1, 2021. 

Securities available for sale and held to maturity 

Valuations of debt securities are performed using observable inputs obtained from market transactions in similar securities. Typical inputs include benchmark yields, consensus prepayment speeds, and credit spreads. Trades from similar securities and broker quotes are used to support these valuations. 

Loans held for sale 

FHN determines the fair value of loans held for sale using either current transaction prices or discounted cash flow models. Fair values are determined using current transaction prices and/or values on similar assets when available, including committed bids for specific loans or loan portfolios. Uncommitted bids may be adjusted based on other available market information. 

Fair value of residential real estate loans held for sale determined using a discounted cash flow model incorporates both observable and unobservable inputs. Inputs in the discounted cash flow model include current mortgage rates for similar products, estimated prepayment rates, foreclosure losses, and various loan performance measures (delinquency, LTV, credit score). Adjustments for delinquency and other differences in loan characteristics are typically reflected in the model&#8217;s discount rates. Loss severity trends and the value of underlying collateral are also considered in assessing the appropriate fair value for severely delinquent loans and loans in foreclosure. The valuation of HELOCs also incorporates estimated cancellation rates for loans expected to become delinquent. 

Non-mortgage consumer loans held for sale are valued using committed bids for specific loans or loan portfolios or current market pricing for similar assets with adjustments for differences in credit standing (delinquency, historical default rates for similar loans), yield, collateral values and prepayment rates. If pricing for similar assets is not available, a discounted cash flow methodology is utilized, which incorporates all of these factors into an estimate of investor required yield for the discount rate. 

FHN utilizes quoted market prices of similar instruments or broker and dealer quotations to value the SBA and USDA guaranteed loans. FHN values SBA-unguaranteed interests in loans held for sale based on individual loan characteristics, such as industry type and pay history which generally follows an income approach. Furthermore, these valuations are adjusted for changes in prepayment estimates and are reduced due to restrictions on trading. The fair value of other non-residential real estate loans held for sale is approximated by their carrying values based on current transaction values. 

Mortgage loans held for investment at fair value option 

The fair value of mortgage loans held for investment at fair value option is determined by a third party using a discounted cash flow model using various assumptions about future loan performance (constant prepayment rate, constant default rate and loss severity trends) and market discount rates.

##TABLE_START ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#38; SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

NOTE 23&#8212;FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ##TABLE_END

Loans held for investment 

The fair values of mortgage loans are estimated using an exit price methodology that is based on present values using the interest rate that would be charged for a similar loan to a borrower with similar risk, weighted for varying maturity dates and adjusted for a liquidity discount based on the estimated time period to complete a sale transaction with a market participant. 

Other loans and leases are valued based on present values using the interest rate that would be charged for a similar instrument to a borrower with similar risk, applicable to each category of instruments, and adjusted for a liquidity discount based on the estimated time period to complete a sale transaction with a market participant. 

For loans measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell, fair value is estimated using appraisals of the collateral. Collateral values are monitored and additional write-downs are recognized if it is determined that the estimated collateral values have declined further. Estimated costs to sell are based on current amounts of disposal costs for similar assets. Carrying value is considered to reflect fair value for these loans. 

Derivative assets and liabilities 

The fair value for forwards and futures contracts is based on current transactions involving identical securities. Futures contracts are exchange-traded and thus have no credit risk factor assigned as the risk of non-performance is limited to the clearinghouse used. 

Valuations of other derivatives (primarily interest rate contracts) are based on inputs observed in active markets for similar instruments. Typical inputs include benchmark yields, option volatility and option skew. Centrally cleared derivatives are discounted using SOFR as required by clearinghouses. In measuring the fair value of these derivative assets and liabilities, FHN has elected to consider credit risk based on the net exposure to individual counterparties. Credit risk is mitigated for these instruments through the use of mutual margining and master netting agreements as well as collateral posting requirements. For derivative contracts with daily cash margin requirements that are considered settlements, the daily margin amount is netted within derivative assets or liabilities. Any remaining credit risk related to interest rate derivatives is considered in determining fair value through evaluation of additional factors such as client loan grades and debt ratings. Foreign currency related derivatives also utilize observable exchange rates in the determination of fair value. The determination of fair value for FHN&#8217;s derivative liabilities associated with its prior sales of Visa Class B shares are classified within Level 3 in the fair value measurements disclosure as previously discussed in the unobservable inputs discussion. 

The fair value of risk participations is determined in reference to the fair value of the related derivative contract between the borrower and the lead bank in the participation structure, which is determined consistent with the valuation process discussed above. This value is adjusted for the pro rata portion of the reference derivative&#8217;s notional value and an assessment of credit risk for the referenced borrower. 

OREO 

OREO primarily consists of properties that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt. These properties are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan amount or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the real estate. Estimated fair value is determined using appraised values with subsequent adjustments for deterioration in values that are not reflected in the most recent appraisal. 

Other assets 

For disclosure purposes, other assets consist of tax credit investments, FRB and FHLB Stock, deferred compensation mutual funds and equity investments (including other mutual funds) with readily determinable fair values. Tax credit investments accounted for under the equity method are written down to estimated fair value quarterly based on the estimated value of the associated tax credits which incorporates estimates of required yield for hypothetical investors. The fair value of all other tax credit investments is estimated using recent transaction information with adjustments for differences in individual investments. Deferred compensation mutual funds are recognized at fair value, which is based on quoted prices in active markets. 

Investments in the stock of the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Banks are recognized at historical cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets which is considered to approximate fair value. Investments in mutual funds are measured at the funds&#8217; reported closing net asset values. Investments in equity securities are valued using quoted market prices when available. 

Defined maturity deposits 

The fair value of these deposits is estimated by discounting future cash flows to their present value. Future cash flows are discounted by using the current market rates of similar instruments applicable to the remaining maturity. For disclosure purposes, defined maturity deposits include all time deposits. 

Short-term financial liabilities 

The fair value of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other short-term borrowings are approximated by the book value. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization.

Loan commitments 

Fair values of these commitments are based on fees charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties&#8217; credit standing. 

Other commitments 

Fair values of these commitments are based on fees charged to enter into similar agreements. 

The following fair value estimates are determined as of a specific point in time utilizing various assumptions and estimates. The use of assumptions and various valuation techniques, as well as the absence of secondary markets for certain financial instruments, reduces the comparability of fair value disclosures between financial institutions. Due to market illiquidity, the fair values for loans and leases, loans held for sale, and term borrowings as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, involve the use of significant internally-developed pricing assumptions for certain components of these line items. The assumptions and valuations utilized for this disclosure are considered to reflect inputs that market participants would use in transactions involving these instruments as of the measurement date. The valuations of legacy assets, 

particularly consumer loans and TRUPS loans within the Corporate segment, are influenced by changes in economic conditions since origination and risk perceptions of the financial sector. These considerations affect the estimate of a potential acquirer&#8217;s cost of capital and cash flow volatility assumptions from these assets and the resulting fair value measurements may depart significantly from FHN&#8217;s internal estimates of the intrinsic value of these assets. 

Assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments have not been included in the following table such as the value of long-term relationships with deposit and trust clients, premises and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes, and certain other assets and other liabilities. Additionally, these measurements are solely for financial instruments as of the measurement date and do not consider the earnings potential of our various business lines. Accordingly, the total of the fair value amounts does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of FHN. 

The following table summarizes the book value and estimated fair value of financial instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:
