Introduction and Business Overview 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We are a premier consumer financial services company delivering one of the industry's most complete, digitally-enabled product suites. Our experience, expertise and scale encompass a broad spectrum of industries including digital, health and wellness, retail, telecommunications, home, auto, outdoor, pet and more. We have an established and diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our &#8220;partners.&#8221; For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we financed $46.8 billion and $89.2 billion of purchase volume, respectively, and had 71.0 million and 71.4 million average active accounts, respectively, and at June 30, 2024, we had $102.3 billion of loan receivables. 

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition, through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail, affinity relationships and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;), money market accounts, savings accounts and sweep and affinity deposits. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base has continued to serve as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. At June 30, 2024, we had $83.1 billion in deposits, which represented 84% of our total funding sources. 

Our Sales Platforms 

_________________________________________________________________ 

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, credit losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our revenue activities are within the United States. We primarily manage our credit products through five sales platforms (Home &#38; Auto, Digital, Diversified &#38; Value, Health &#38; Wellness and Lifestyle). Those platforms are organized by the types of partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales metrics. 

Home &#38; Auto 

Our Home &#38; Auto sales platform provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated in-store and digital experiences through a broad network of partners and merchants providing home and automotive merchandise and services, as well as our Synchrony Car Care network and Synchrony HOME credit card offering. Our Home &#38; Auto sales platform partners include a wide range of key retailers in the home improvement, furniture, bedding, flooring, appliance and electronics industry, such as Ashley HomeStores LTD, Floor &#38; Decor, Lowe's, and Mattress Firm, as well as automotive merchandise and services, such as Chevron and Discount Tire. In addition, we also have program agreements with manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations, such as Generac, Nationwide Marketing Group and the Home Furnishings Association. 

Digital 

Our Digital sales platform provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated digital experiences through partners and merchants who primarily engage with their consumers through digital channels. Our Digital sales platform includes key partners delivering digital payment solutions, such as PayPal, including our Venmo program, online marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay, and digital-first brands and merchants, such as Verizon, the Qurate brands, and Fanatics. 

Diversified &#38; Value 

Our Diversified &#38; Value sales platform provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated in-store and digital experiences through large retail partners who deliver everyday value to consumers shopping for daily needs or important life moments. Our Diversified &#38; Value sales platform is comprised of five large retail partners: Belk, Fleet Farm, JCPenney, Sam's Club and TJX Companies, Inc. 

Health &#38; Wellness 

Our Health &#38; Wellness sales platform provides comprehensive healthcare payments and financing solutions, through a network of providers and health systems, for those seeking health and wellness care for themselves, their families and their pets, and includes our CareCredit brand, as well as partners such as Walgreens. 

Lifestyle 

Lifestyle provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated in-store and digital experiences through partners and merchants who offer merchandise in power sports, outdoor power equipment, and other industries such as sporting goods, apparel, jewelry and music. Our Lifestyle sales platform partners include a wide range of key retailers in the apparel, specialty retail, outdoor, music and luxury industry, such as American Eagle, Dick's Sporting Goods, Guitar Center, Kawasaki, Pandora, Polaris, Suzuki and Sweetwater. 

Corp, Other 

Corp, Other includes activity and balances related to certain program agreements with retail partners and merchants that will not be renewed beyond their current expiration date and certain programs that were previously terminated, which are not managed within the five sales platforms discussed above. Corp, Other also includes amounts related to changes in the fair value of equity investments and realized gains or losses associated with the sale of businesses and investments. 

Our Credit Products 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Through our sales platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer our Payment Security program, which is a debt cancellation product. 

The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at June 30, 2024. 

Promotional Offer Credit Product Standard Terms Only Deferred Interest Other Promotional Total Credit cards 59.1 % 18.3 % 14.6 % 92.0 % Commercial credit products 1.9 &#8212; 0.1 2.0 Consumer installment loans &#8212; 0.2 5.7 5.9 Other 0.1 &#8212; &#8212; 0.1 Total 61.1 % 18.5 % 20.4 % 100.0 % 

Credit Cards 

We offer the following principal types of credit cards: 

&#8226; Private Label Credit Cards. Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe&#8217;s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances. Credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended either on standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer. 

&#8226; Dual Cards and General Purpose Co-Branded Cards. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions. We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as a Synchrony-branded general purpose credit card. Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms and credit is typically extended on standard terms only. We offer either Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards through over 15 of our large partners, of which the majority are Dual Cards, as well as our CareCredit Dual Card. Consumer Dual Cards and Co-Branded cards totaled 26% of our total loan receivables portfolio at June 30, 2024. 

Commercial Credit Products 

We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. 

Installment Loans 

We originate secured installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily for power products in our Outdoor market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). We also offer unsecured installment loans primarily in our Home and Auto and Health and Wellness sales platforms and through our various other installment products, such as our Synchrony Pay Later solutions, including pay monthly and pay in 4 products, for short-term loans. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are generally assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. Installment loans at June 30, 2024 include loan receivables related to Ally Financial Inc.'s point of sale financing business, ("Ally Lending") that was acquired in March 2024. 

Business Trends and Conditions 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions. For a discussion of certain trends and conditions, see &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Trends and Conditions &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. For a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, see &#8220;&#8212; Results of Operations. &#8221; 

CFPB final rule on credit card late fees. 

On March 5, 2024, the CFPB released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act to, among other things, lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior $30 (adjusted to $41 for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles) to $8 and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. The final rule, when effective, will result in a significant reduction in our interest and fees on loan receivables. Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and the ultimate outcome of such challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024; however, on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect. 

In response to the final rule, we have begun to implement a number of product, policy and pricing changes to adjust for the significant reduction in our late fee income. In addition, the combined net effects of the final rule and our mitigating strategies would result in a decrease in payments to partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements. 

While we continue to believe that the strategies we have identified and started to implement will fully offset the decline in late fee income over time, it will take time for such product, policy and pricing changes to offset the reduction in the late fees. Therefore we expect the final rule, if effective in 2024, will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in 2024. The magnitude of these effects in 2024 remain uncertain due to the pending litigation discussed above, which has resulted in a delay in the final rule&#8217;s effective date. In addition, the effects of the final rule are also subject to other factors that could increase the adverse effects to our results of operations, including our ability to successfully implement the product, policy and pricing changes we have identified, as well as any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to these changes or the final rule itself. 

For a discussion of risks related to a CFPB final late fee rule, please see &#8220;&#8212;Risk Factors Relating to our Business&#8212;The CFPB&#8217;s proposed rule on credit card late fees, if adopted, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations&#8221; , in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Growth in loan receivables and interest income. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we experienced a decrease in purchase volume of 0.9% primarily driven by lower consumer spending and the impacts from credit actions we have taken across our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of default. We expect these same factors to now result in flat or a low single digit decrease in purchase volume for the second half of 2024. As a result, while we still anticipate loan receivables to increase for the remainder of 2024, we expect the rate of growth to moderate. 

All of the factors discussed above and in our 2023 Form 10-K, such as customer payment behavior and the CFPB final rule on credit card late fees, will continue to have an effect on our loan receivables and interest income. For additional discussion of those factors, please see &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Trends and Conditions-CFPB final rule on credit card late fees" and "&#8212;Growth in loan receivables and interest income &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Seasonality 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables typically occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down. 

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. 

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates, resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status, resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, even in instances of improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends. 

However, in addition to these seasonal trends, the elevated customer payment behavior we have experienced in recent years and more recently the subsequent moderation from these elevated levels, has also significantly impacted our key financial metrics and the fluctuations experienced between quarterly periods. The effects from these changes in customer payment behavior have resulted in either partial, or in some instances full, offset to the impact from the ongoing seasonal trends discussed above. 

Results of Operations 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Highlights for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 

Below are highlights of our performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as applicable, except as otherwise noted. 

&#8226; Net earnings increased to $643 million from $569 million and to $1.9 billion from $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher net interest income and lower retailer share arrangements, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the after-tax gain on sale related to Pets Best of $802 million, as well as the same trends experienced in the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

&#8226; Loan receivables increased 7.9% to $102.3 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $94.8 billion at June 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower customer payment rates and the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition. 

&#8226; Net interest income increased 6.9% to $4.4 billion and 7.8% to $8.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Interest and fees on loans increased 10.2% and 12.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense increased 30.6% and 43.0%, respectively, due to higher benchmark rates and higher interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8226; Retailer share arrangements decreased 8.7% to $810 million and 12.7% to $1.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. 

&#8226; Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased 63 basis points to 4.47% at June 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2023. The net charge-off rate increased 167 basis points to 6.42% and increased 175 basis points to 6.37% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses increased by $308 million, or 22.3%, and $902 million, or 33.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by lower reserve builds. The reserve build in the six months ended June 30, 2024 included $180 million related to the Ally Lending acquisition. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loan receivables) increased to 10.74% at June 30, 2024, as compared to 10.34% at June 30, 2023. 

&#8226; Other income increased by $56 million to $117 million, and by $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a gain of $51 million related to an exchange of Visa Class B-1 common stock as well as the initial impact of our product, pricing and policy change related fees, partially offset by the impact of the Pets Best disposition. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the gain on sale related to the Pets Best disposition. 

&#8226; Other expense increased by $8 million, or 0.7%, and $95 million, or 4.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by technology investments, preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change and servicing costs related to the newly acquired business, partially offset by lower operational losses and cost discipline resulting in lower employee and marketing costs. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by these same factors, other than employee costs which increased primarily attributable to an increase in headcount driven by growth. 

&#8226; At June 30, 2024, deposits represented 84% of our total funding sources. Total deposits increased by 2.4% to $83.1 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. 

&#8226; During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we declared and paid cash dividends totaling $30 million on our Series A 5.625% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and our Series B 8.250% fixed rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. 

&#8226; During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased $600 million of our outstanding common stock, and declared and paid cash dividends of $0.50 per share, or $202 million in the aggregate. In April 2024, the Board of Directors approved an incremental share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion, through June 30, 2025, and maintained the quarterly dividend at its current amount of $0.25 per common share. At June 30, 2024 we had a total share repurchase authorization of $1.0 billion remaining. For more information, see &#8220;Capital&#8212;Dividend and Share Repurchases.&#8221; 

&#8226; In March 2024, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pets Best, for consideration comprising a combination of cash and an equity interest in Independence Pet Holdings, Inc. The sale resulted in the recognition of a gain on sale of $1.1 billion, or $802 million net of tax. 

&#8226; In March 2024, we acquired Ally Lending for cash consideration of $2.0 billion. The assets and liabilities of Ally Lending primarily included loan receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $2.2 billion. See Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

2024 Partner Agreements 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we continued to expand and diversify our portfolio with the addition or renewal of more than 40 partners, which included the following: 

&#8226; In our Home &#38; Auto sales platform, we announced our new partnerships with Bel Furniture and The Carpet Guys and extended our program agreements with Associated Materials, BrandsMart and Jerome's Furniture Warehouse.

For a summary description of the composition of our key line items included in our Statements of Earnings, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Interest Income 

Interest income increased by $561 million, or 11.2%, and $1.3 billion, or 13.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by increases in interest and fees on loans of 10.2% and 12.4%, respectively. The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 in interest and fees on loans were primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower customer payment rates and higher benchmark rates.

Average loan receivables, including held for sale, increased 9.7% and 10.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by lower customer payment rates. Purchase volume decreased by 0.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 reflecting lower consumer spend as well as the impact of credit actions. Purchase volume increased 0.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 reflecting growth in average active accounts and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by lower consumer spend and the impact of credit actions. 

Yield on average interest-earning assets 

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in the yield on average loan receivables. The increases in loan receivable yield were 14 basis points to 21.01% and 31 basis points to 21.05% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased by $276 million to $1.2 billion, and $704 million to $2.3 billion, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, due to higher benchmark rates and higher interest-bearing liabilities. Our cost of funds increased to 4.80% and 4.77% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.04% and 3.74% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased by $285 million, or 6.9%, and $639 million, or 7.8%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, resulting from the changes in interest income and interest expense discussed above. 

Retailer Share Arrangements 

Retailer share arrangements decreased by $77 million, or 8.7%, and $230 million, or 12.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses increased by $308 million, or 22.3%, and $902 million, or 33.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by lower reserve builds in the current year. The reserve build in the six months ended June 30, 2024 included $180 million related to the Ally Lending acquisition. 

Other Income 

Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interchange revenue $ 263 $ 262 $ 504 $ 494 Protection product revenue 125 125 266 240 Loyalty programs (346) (345) (665) (643) Other 75 19 1,169 35 Total other income $ 117 $ 61 $ 1,274 $ 126 

Other income increased by $56 million to $117 million, and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we participated in the Visa exchange offer, which included the exchange of Visa Class B-1 common stock for Visa Class C common stock, which was recorded at fair value. The increase in other income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven primarily by a gain of $51 million related to the exchange of Visa Class B-1 common stock and the initial impact of our product, pricing and policy change related fees, partially offset by lower commission fees following the Pets Best disposition. 

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the gain on sale related to the Pets Best disposition. The pre-tax gain amount of $1.1 billion is included within the Other component of Other Income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Other Expense 

Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Employee costs $ 434 $ 451 $ 930 $ 902 Professional fees 236 209 456 395 Marketing and business development 129 133 254 264 Information processing 207 179 393 345 Other 171 197 350 382 Total other expense $ 1,177 $ 1,169 $ 2,383 $ 2,288 

Other expense increased by $8 million, or 0.7% and by $95 million, or 4.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. 

The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by technology investments, preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change and servicing costs related to the newly acquired business, partially offset by lower operational losses and cost discipline resulting in lower employee and marketing costs. 

The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the same factors for the three months ended June 30, 2024, other than employee costs, which increased for the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily attributable to an increase in headcount driven by growth. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Effective tax rate 23.8 % 23.3 % 24.1 % 23.6 % Provision for income taxes $ 201 $ 173 $ 616 $ 362 

The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of research and development credits recorded in the prior period. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in state tax expense in the current period related to the Pets Best disposition. For both periods presented, the effective tax rate differs from the applicable U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes. 

Platform Analysis 

As discussed above under &#8220;&#8212; Our Sales Platforms ,&#8221; we offer our credit products primarily through five sales platforms (Home &#38; Auto, Digital, Diversified &#38; Value, Health &#38; Wellness and Lifestyle), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, for each of our five sales platforms and Corp, Other.

Home &#38; Auto interest and fees on loans increased by $144 million, or 11.3%, and increased by $301 million, or 12.0%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. The increase in average loan receivables for both periods primarily reflects the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition as well as the impact of lower customer payment rates. Purchase volume decreased 2.8% and 3.0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as growth in Home Specialty and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition were more than offset by a combination of lower consumer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and the impact of credit actions.

Digital interest and fees on loans increased by $122 million, or 8.6%, and $326 million, or 11.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower payment rates and higher benchmark rates. Purchase volume decreased by 0.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as continued customer engagement through growth in average active accounts was more than offset by lower consumer spend per account and the impact of credit actions. Purchase volume increased by 1.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting continued customer engagement through growth in average active accounts. Average active accounts increased 1.8% and 2.8%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

Diversified &#38; Value interest and fees on loans increased by $74 million, or 6.8%, and $218 million, or 10.1%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower payment rates and higher benchmark rates. Purchase volume was flat for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as growth in out-of-partner spend was offset by the impact of credit actions. Purchase volume increased by 1.9%, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, reflecting growth in both in-partner and out-of-partner spend, partially offset by the impact of credit actions. Average active accounts remained flat and increased by 0.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

Health &#38; Wellness interest and fees on loans increased by $125 million, or 15.9%, and $259 million, or 17.0%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables. The growth in average loan receivables for both periods reflected higher purchase volume and lower customer payment rates, as well as the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition. Purchase volume increased 1.8% and 4.7%, respectively, and average active accounts increased 9.8% and 9.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting broad-based growth led by Pet, partially offset by lower spend in Vision. 

Other income decreased by $6 million, or 11.1%, and $1 million, or 0.9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower commission fees following the Pets Best disposition, partially offset by lower loyalty costs. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower commission fees following the Pets Best disposition, partially offset by higher protection product revenue.

Loan Receivables 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenue. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s and Note 5. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our loan receivables. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated.

Loan receivables decreased 0.7% to $102.3 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $103.0 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the seasonality of our business, partially offset by the Ally Lending acquisition and lower customer payment rates. Loan receivables related to the Ally Lending acquisition are included within Consumer installment loans at June 30, 2024 in the table above. 

Loan receivables increased 7.9% to $102.3 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $94.8 billion at June 30, 2023 driven by lower customer payment rates and the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition.

Delinquencies 

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.47% at June 30, 2024 from 3.84% at June 30, 2023, and decreased from 4.74% at December 31, 2023. The increase compared to June 30, 2023, was primarily driven by lower customer payment rates. The decrease in delinquency rate during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the seasonality of our business. 

Net Charge-Offs 

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in Other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

The table below sets forth the net charge-offs and ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, (&#8220;net charge-off rate&#8221;) for the periods indicated.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses totaled $11.0 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2023, respectively, and $9.8 billion at June 30, 2023, and reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 10.74% at June 30, 2024, from 10.26% at December 31, 2023 and increased from 10.34% at June 30, 2023. 

The increase in allowance for credit losses compared to December 31, 2023 includes the addition of the Ally Lending portfolio. See Note 5. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. 

Funding Sources 

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior and subordinated unsecured notes. 

The following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated: &#160; 2024 2023 Three months ended June 30 ($ in millions) Average Balance % Average Rate Average Balance % Average Rate

Deposits 

We obtain deposits directly from retail, affinity relationships and commercial customers (&#8220;direct deposits&#8221;) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers (&#8220;brokered deposits&#8221;). At June 30, 2024, we had $70.8 billion in direct deposits and $12.3 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to utilize our direct deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low-cost funding. 

Our direct deposits are primarily from retail customers and include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts, savings accounts, sweep and affinity deposits. 

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 10 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal. 

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

Our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years. At June 30, 2024, the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing time deposits was 1.0 years. See Note 8. Deposits to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the maturities of our time deposits.

(2) The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. Deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit presented above include partially insured accounts. Our estimate of the uninsured portion of these deposit balances at June 30, 2024 was approximately $5.8 billion. 

Securitized Financings 

We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (&#8220;SYNIT&#8221;) through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (&#8220;SYNCT&#8221;) and the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (&#8220;SFT&#8221;). 

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors&#8217; interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at June 30, 2024.

______________________ 

(1) Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNIT notes that we owned at June 30, 2024. 

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller&#8217;s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own. 

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT. 

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at June 30, 2024. 

Note Principal Balance ($ in millions) # of Series Outstanding Three-Month Rolling

______________________ 

(1) Represents the excess spread (generally calculated as interest income collected from the applicable pool of loan receivables less applicable net charge-offs, interest expense and servicing costs, divided by the aggregate principal amount of loan receivables in the applicable pool) for SFT or, in the case of SYNCT, a range of the excess spreads relating to the particular series issued within such trust or, in the case of SYNIT, the excess spread relating to the one outstanding series issued within such trust, in all cases omitting any series that have not been outstanding for at least three full monthly periods and calculated in accordance with the applicable trust or series documentation, for the three securitization monthly periods ended June 30, 2024.

______________________ 

(1) Weighted average interest rate of all senior and subordinated unsecured notes at June 30, 2024 was 4.72%. 

(2) The amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented. 

Covenants 

The indentures pursuant to which our senior and subordinated unsecured notes have been issued include various covenants. If we do not satisfy any of these covenants, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at June 30, 2024. 

At June 30, 2024, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities. 

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: 

S&#38;P Fitch Ratings Synchrony Financial Senior unsecured debt BBB- BBB- Subordinated unsecured debt BB+ BB+ Preferred stock BB- B+ Outlook for Synchrony Financial Stable Positive Synchrony Bank Senior unsecured debt BBB BBB- Outlook for Synchrony Bank Stable Positive 

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&#38;P and/or Moody&#8217;s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets. 

Liquidity 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions. 

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. 

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at June 30, 2024 had $20.0 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $16.8 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2023. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the seasonality of our business, deposit growth and the proceeds from the Pets Best disposition, as well as issuances of secured notes and preferred stock. We believe our liquidity position at June 30, 2024 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change. 

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions. 

We also have access to several additional sources of liquidity beyond our liquidity portfolio. At June 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of $10.2 billion of available borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window, $2.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders. In addition, we have other unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window. 

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends, see &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Risk Factors Relating to Regulation&#8212;We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness &#8221; and &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Regulation Relating to Our Business&#8212;Savings Association Regulation&#8212;Dividends and Stock Repurchases &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Capital 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders. 

Beginning in 2024, we are now subject to the Federal Reserve Board's formal capital plan submission requirements and have submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board.

In April 2024, the Board of Directors approved an incremental share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion through June 30, 2025 (the "2024 plan"). At June 30, 2024, all of the authorization capacity under the 2024 plan remained outstanding. Repurchases under this program are subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals, if any. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial 

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At June 30, 2024, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Basel III &#160; At June 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 ($ in millions) Amount Ratio (1) 

Amount Ratio (1) 

Total risk-based capital $ 16,438 15.8 % $ 15,464 14.9 % Tier 1 risk-based capital $ 14,290 13.8 % $ 13,334 12.9 % Tier 1 leverage $ 14,290 12.0 % $ 13,334 11.7 % Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 13,068 12.6 % $ 12,600 12.2 % Risk-weighted assets $ 103,718 $ 103,460 

______________________ 

(1) Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. 

The Company elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delayed the effects of CECL on our regulatory capital. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the effects are being phased-in over a three-year transitional period through 2024, collectively the &#8220;CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment&#8221;. The effects of CECL on our regulatory capital will be fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025. For more information, see &#8220; Capital&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Capital amounts and ratios in the above table all reflect the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. The increase in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the retention of net earnings during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the net impact of the Pets Best disposition and Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by the third year phase-in of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Bank 

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and also reflects the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. 

&#160; At June 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Minimum to be Well-Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions ($ in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Ratio Total risk-based capital $ 15,072 15.3 % $ 14,943 15.3 % 10.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital $ 12,984 13.2 % $ 12,880 13.2 % 8.0% Tier 1 leverage $ 12,984 11.6 % $ 12,880 12.0 % 5.0% Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 12,984 13.2 % $ 12,880 13.2 % 6.5% 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Risk Factors Relating to Regulation&#8212;Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At June 30, 2024, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 6 - Variable Interest Entities to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our investment commitments for unconsolidated variable interest entities (&#8220;VIE's&#8221;). 

We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each unused credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 5 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or material changes to our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates. 

Regulation and Supervision 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of our profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance. 

As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. 

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 

On March 5, 2024, the CFPB released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act to, among other things, lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior $30 (adjusted to $41 for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles) to $8 and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024. Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect. The final outcome of such challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. See "Business Trends and Conditions" above for the anticipated financial impacts related to the final rule. 

On June 20, 2024, the FDIC released a final rule imposing additional requirements for the content of resolution plans submitted by insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank, following the rule&#8217;s effective date of October 1, 2024. Under the final rule, if the FDIC deems a resolution plan filing not credible and the insured depository institution fails to resubmit a credible plan, the institution could become subject to an enforcement action. Our first resolution plan under the final rule is due on July 1, 2025 and we will be required to file a resolution plan once every three years thereafter. Additionally, we will be required to submit interim supplements annually. We are evaluating the impact of the final rule.
