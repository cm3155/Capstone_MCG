Pending Merger with Sterling Bancorp 

On April 19, 2021, Webster and Sterling, a full-service regional bank headquartered in Pearl River, New York, that primarily serves the Greater New York metropolitan region, announced that their boards of directors approved by unanimous vote a definitive agreement under which the two companies will combine in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Sterling will merge into Webster, and Sterling's shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.463 of a Webster common share for each share of Sterling common stock owned. In addition, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Sterling's Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive a newly created series of Webster preferred stock having substantially the same terms. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of Webster and Sterling. Based on the number of shares of both Sterling common stock and Webster common stock outstanding on July 2, 2021, it is estimated that following the completion of the merger, former holders of Webster common stock will own approximately 50.4% of the combined company, and former holders of Sterling common stock will own approximately 49.6% of the combined company. 

In connection with the proposed transaction, the Company incurred $17.1 million of merger-related expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily consisting of professional fees for investment banking, legal, accounting, and employee retention costs. There were no significant merger-related expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2021. 

At June 30, 2021, Sterling reported $29.1 billion in assets, including $4.4 billion in investment securities and $20.7 billion in loans, $24.4 billion in liabilities, including $23.1 billion in deposits, and $4.7 billion in shareholders' equity. 

Strategic Initiatives 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company launched a strategic plan to drive incremental revenue and cost savings measures across the organization through the consolidation of banking centers and corporate facilities, process automation, ancillary spend reduction, and other organizational actions. As of June 30, 2021, the Company completed all 26 of its announced banking center closures, has progressed on business process automation and ancillary spend reduction, and continues to realize operational efficiencies from the realignment of certain of the Company's business banking and investment services operations across its reportable segments. 

Strategic initiative costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included $2.1 million in severance due to voluntary terminations, $3.7 million in facilities optimization, and $4.8 million in other project costs. Additional costs will be incurred as the Company continues to manage the strategic plan and further realize operational benefits. The Company anticipates it will reach its expense reduction targets by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. 

Refer to Note 3: Business Developments and Note 17: Segment Reporting in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the financial statement impact of the strategic plan, as well as the "Segment Reporting" section contained elsewhere in this report for further details specific to the Company's segment changes. 

COVID-19 Update 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the United States' economy, affecting banking and other financial activities in the areas in which the Company operates. In conjunction with the easing of restrictions imposed by state and local governments across Webster's footprint, the Company continues to increase its available building capacity in order to allow both employees and customers the opportunity to return to the office and use Webster's banking centers on a regular basis. Health and safety protocols remain in compliance with state and federal guidelines while we continue to monitor the spread of more contagious variants of the virus. Information regarding the effects and potential effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Webster's business, operating results, and financial condition is further discussed throughout Item 2.

The non-GAAP financial measures identified in the preceding table provide both management and investors with information useful in understanding the Company's financial position, operating results, strength of its capital position, and overall business performance. These measures are used by management for internal planning and forecasting purposes, as well as by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance. Management believes that this presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner. 

The tangible common equity ratio represents shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock, goodwill, and intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets, and is used by management to evaluate the strength of the Company's capital position. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated using the Company&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the tax-effected amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of average shareholders&#8217; equity less average preferred stock, average goodwill, and intangible assets. This measure is used by management to assess Webster's performance along with its peer financial institutions. The efficiency ratio, which represents the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is calculated excluding certain non-operational items in order to measure how the Company is managing its recurring operating expenses. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP (U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis measures and results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Financial Performance 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Net income increased $40.9 million, or 77.1%, from $53.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to $94.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a $61.5 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was partially offset by $18.2 million of merger-related and strategic initiatives charges. 

Diluted earnings per common share increased $0.44, or 77.2%, from $0.57 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to $1.01 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. 

The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) decreased 340 basis points from 60.04% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 56.64% for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to higher HSA interchange and other deposit service fees, increased investment service activity, and cost savings from the Company's strategic initiatives. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Net income increased $110.8 million, or 121.4%, from $91.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $202.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a $163.3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, offset by the impact of the net decrease in rates on interest-earning assets and liabilities in addition to $27.6 million of merger-related and strategic initiatives charges. 

Diluted earnings per common share increased $1.23, or 128.1%, from $0.96 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $2.19 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) decreased 145 basis points from 59.01% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 57.56% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to higher HSA interchange and other deposit service fees, increased investment service activity, and cost savings from the Company's strategic initiatives.

Net interest income (NII) and net interest margin are impacted by the level of interest rates, mix of assets earning and liabilities bearing those interest rates, and the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by changes in economic conditions that impact interest rate policy, competitive conditions that impact loan and deposit pricing strategies, as well as the extent of interest lost to non-performing assets. 

NII is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. NII is the Company's largest source of revenue, representing 74.8% of total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Net interest margin is the ratio of tax-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. 

Webster manages the risk of changes in interest rates on net interest income and net interest margin through its Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies. ALCO meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment securities and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook, its interest rate expectations, the portfolio risk position, and other factors. 

Four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk: 

&#8226; the size, duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio; 

&#8226; the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio; 

&#8226; interest rate contracts; and 

&#8226; the pricing and structure of loans and deposits. 

The federal funds rate target range was 0-0.25% at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.50-1.75% at December 31, 2019. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rate increased to 1.45% at June 30, 2021 from 0.93% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.92% at December 31, 2019. Refer to the "Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk" section for further discussion of Webster's interest rate risk position. 

Net Interest Income 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Net interest income decreased $3.6 million, or 1.58%, from $224.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to $220.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in net interest income was also $3.6 million on a fully tax-equivalent basis. 

Net interest margin decreased 17 basis points from 2.99% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.82% for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower loan and securities yields, partially offset by deposit and borrowing costs, and Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan fee accretion. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Net interest income decreased $10.6 million, or 2.33%, from $455.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $444.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The year-over-year decrease in net interest income was also $10.6 million on a fully tax-equivalent basis. 

Net interest margin decreased 24 basis points from 3.11% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.87% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower loan and securities yields, partially offset by deposit and borrowing costs, PPP loan fee accretion, and commercial portfolio loan growth. 

Changes in Net Interest Income 

The following table presents the components of the change in net interest income attributable to changes in rate and volume, and reflects net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis:

Average loans and leases for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $0.5 billion as compared to the average balance for the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to the origination of second round PPP loans. The loan and lease portfolio comprised 68.4% of the average interest-earning assets at June 30, 2021 as compared to 70.7% of the average interest-earning assets at June 30, 2020. The loan and lease portfolio yield decreased 42 basis points from 3.93% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 3.51% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in the yield is primarily due to decreased prepayments and premium amortization. 

Average securities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $1.3 billion as compared to the average balance for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The securities portfolio comprised 31.6% of the average interest-earning assets at June 30, 2021 as compared to 29.2% of the average interest-earning assets at June 30, 2020. The securities portfolio yield decreased 84 basis points from 2.76% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 1.92% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in yield is primarily due to higher premium amortization and lower yield from newly purchased securities. 

Average total deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $3.5 billion as compared to the average balance for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was driven by transactional deposit products resulting from fiscal stimulus. The average cost of deposits decreased 30 basis points from 0.38% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 0.08% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to deposit product mix and the repricing of maturing certificates of deposit. Higher cost time deposits decreased as a percentage of total interest-bearing deposits from 15.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 10.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to customer migration for more liquid deposit products. 

Average total borrowings for the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $1.9 billion as compared to the average balance for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Specifically, average securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings decreased $925.8 million and average FHLB advances decreased $945.7 million. The average cost of borrowings increased 25 basis points from 1.62% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 1.87% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase is primarily a result of a change in the mix of borrowings types.

The decrease is primarily attributed to improvements in the forecasted economic outlook and favorable credit trends, resulting in a release of reserves. Total net recoveries were $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to net charge-offs of $16.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

Income Taxes 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Webster recognized income tax expense of $34.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $14.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting effective tax rates of 26.6% and 21.8%, respectively. 

The increase in income tax expense is due to a higher level of pre-tax income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2021 reflects the effects of an estimated $16.1 million of the $17.1 million merger-related expenses recognized during the period as nondeductible for tax purposes, and a higher level of pre-tax income estimated for 2021 as compared to 2020. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Webster recognized income tax expense of $64.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and $25.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting effective tax rates of 24.1% and 22.1%, respectively. 

The increase in income tax expense is due to a higher level of pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflects the effects of a higher level of pre-tax income estimated for 2021 as compared to 2020, and the $16.1 million of the $17.1 million merger-related expenses recognized during the period as nondeductible for tax purposes. Those effects were partially offset by the recognition of $2.4 million of net tax benefits specific to the six months ended June 30, 2021, which includes $1.8 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, as compared to $0.2 million of net tax expense specific to the six months ended June 30, 2020, which included tax deficiencies of $0.6 million from stock-based compensation. 

For additional information on Webster's income taxes, including its deferred tax assets (DTAs), refer to Note 10: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Segment Reporting 

Webster's operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses: Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Retail Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, how discrete financial information is evaluated, the type of customer served, and how products and services are provided. Segments are evaluated using pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR). Certain Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. For additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s reportable segments and its segment reporting methodology, refer to Note 17: Segment Reporting in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

Effective January 1, 2021, management realigned certain of the Company's business banking and investment services operations to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. The previously reported Community Banking segment was also renamed as Retail Banking. Under this realignment, $1.9 billion of loans, $2.2 billion of deposits, and $3.9 billion of assets under administration (off-balance sheet) were reassigned from Retail Banking to Commercial Banking. Additionally, $131.0 million of goodwill was reallocated, on a relative fair value basis, from Retail Banking to Commercial Banking. Prior period amounts have been recasted to reflect the realignment. 

The following is a description of Webster&#8217;s three reportable segments and their primary services: 

Commercial Banking serves businesses that have more than $2 million of revenue through its business banking, middle market, asset-based lending, equipment finance, commercial real estate lending, sponsor finance, and treasury services business units. Additionally, its Wealth group provides wealth management solutions to business owners, operators, and consumers within the Company's targeted markets and retail footprint. 

HSA Bank offers a comprehensive consumer-directed healthcare solution that includes HSAs, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits. HSAs are used in conjunction with high deductible health plans in order to facilitate tax advantages for account holders with respect to health care spending and savings, in accordance with applicable laws. HSAs are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers, as well as through national and regional insurance carriers, benefit consultants, and financial advisors. HSA Bank deposits provide long duration, low-cost funding that is used to minimize the Company&#8217;s use of wholesale funding in support of its loan growth. In addition, non-interest revenue is generated predominantly through service fees and interchange income. 

Retail Banking serves consumer and small business banking customers by offering consumer deposit and fee-based services, residential mortgages, home equity lines, secured and unsecured loans, and credit card products through its consumer lending and small business banking business units. Retail Banking operates a distribution network consisting of 130 banking centers and 253 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services, primarily throughout southern New England and into Westchester County, New York.

Deposits increased $653.3 million at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by excess customer liquidity as a result of government stimulus and reduced spending.

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

PPNR increased $16.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. Net interest income increased $10.9 million, driven by PPP loan fee accretion and deposit growth, partially offset by lower consumer loan balances. Non-interest income increased $0.5 million, resulting from higher deposit-related service charges and loan servicing fee income, partially offset by lower fee income from mortgage banking activities. Non-interest expense decreased $4.8 million, driven by lower compensation and benefits, pension costs, occupancy, and marketing expenses. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

PPNR increased $25.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Loans decreased $246.9 million at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease is due to lower small business, home equity, and other consumer loan balances, partially offset by higher residential mortgage balances. 

Loan originations during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The $297.9 million increase resulted from $248.4 million of second round PPP loan originations coupled with increased residential mortgage and home equity originations in the lower interest rate environment. 

Deposits increased $656.9 million at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to two government stimulus payments to consumers and an additional round of PPP loan fundings, coupled with seasonally higher balances in business and consumer transaction accounts. This also drove balance increases in savings and money market products, partially offset by a decline in certificate of deposit balances. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets were $33.8 billion at June 30, 2021 as compared to $32.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The $1.2 billion increase was primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $166.2 million decrease in loans and leases. 

Total liabilities were $30.4 billion at June 30, 2021 as compared to $29.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The $1.0 billion increase was primarily driven by a $1.5 billion increase in deposits, specifically increases of $0.6 billion, $0.7 billion, $0.2 billion in demand deposits, interest-bearing deposits, and HSA deposits, respectively, and a $45.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $0.5 billion decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. 

Total shareholders' equity was $3.3 billion at June 30, 2021 as compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The $95.1 million increase primarily reflects $202.1 million of net income recognized, offset by $36.4 million of other comprehensive loss (OCL), and $72.5 million and $3.9 million in dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders, respectively. 

Book value per common share was $35.15 at June 30, 2021, as compared to $34.25 at December 31, 2020. On July 19, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.40 per common share. The Company will continue to monitor its ability to pay dividends at this level. Due to the Company's announcement of its pending merger agreement with Sterling, Webster is restricted from paying quarterly cash dividends in excess of the current level until the transaction is closed. 

As of June 30, 2021, both the Company and the Bank were considered well-capitalized, meeting all capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. In accordance with regulatory capital rules, the Company elected the option to delay the impact of the adoption of current expected credit losses (CECL) on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral and subsequent three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. Therefore, capital ratios and amounts as of June 30, 2021 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, held-to-maturity debt securities, and unfunded loan commitments attributed to the adoption of CECL. This resulted in a 26, 7, 26, and 17 basis point benefit to the Company's CET1 risk based capital, total risk based capital, tier 1 risk based capital, and tier 1 leverage capital, respectively, at June 30, 2021. The Company's capital ratios remain in excess of well capitalized even without the benefit of the CECL impact delay.

Investment Securities 

Webster Bank's investment securities are managed within regulatory guidelines and corporate policy, which include limitations on aspects such as concentrations in and types of investments, as well as minimum risk ratings per type of security. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may establish additional individual limits on a certain type of investment if the concentration in such investment presents a safety and soundness concern. In addition to Webster Bank, the Holding Company may also directly hold investment securities. At June 30, 2021, the Company had no holdings in obligations of individual states, counties, or municipalities which exceeded 10% of consolidated shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Through its Corporate Treasury function, Webster maintains investment securities that are primarily used to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs, to generate interest income, and as a means to manage interest-rate risk. Investment securities are classified into two major categories: available-for-sale, which currently consists of agency collateralized mortgage obligations (Agency CMO); agency mortgage-backed securities (Agency MBS); agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (Agency CMBS); non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS); collateralized loan obligations (CLO); and corporate debt, and held-to-maturity, which currently consists of Agency CMO; Agency MBS; Agency CMBS; municipal bonds and notes; and CMBS. Investment securities had a carrying value and an average risk weighting for regulatory purposes of $8.9 billion and 13%, respectively, at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Available-for-sale investment securities decreased $63.9 million, primarily due to paydowns exceeding purchases and a decline in fair value as a result of lower market rates. The tax-equivalent yield in the portfolio was 1.83% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 2.62% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Available-for-sale investment securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses on these securities are attributable to factors other than credit loss, and therefore no ACL has been recorded. Further, the Company does not have the intent to sell these investment securities, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $14.2 million at June 30, 2021. 

Held-to-maturity investment securities increased $55.4 million, primarily due to purchases exceeding paydown activity. The tax-equivalent yield in the portfolio was 2.30% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 2.85% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Held-to-maturity investment securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis under CECL. The ACL on investment securities held-to-maturity was $0.4 million at June 30, 2021. Gross unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investment securities were $20.3 million at June 30, 2021. 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities: &#160; At June 30, 2021 At December 31, 2020 (In thousands) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Available-for-sale:

Webster Bank has the ability to use its investment portfolio, as well as interest-rate derivative financial instruments, within internal policy guidelines to hedge and manage interest-rate risk as part of its asset/liability strategy. Refer to Note 14: Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information concerning derivative financial instruments. 

Loans and Leases 

The following table provides the composition of loans and leases: &#160; At June 30, 2021 At December 31, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) Amount % Amount % Commercial non-mortgage $ 6,843,415 31.9 $ 7,085,076 32.8 Asset-based 943,961 4.4 890,598 4.1 Commercial real estate 6,410,672 29.9 6,322,637 29.2 Equipment financing 630,343 2.9 602,224 2.8 Residential 4,856,302 22.6 4,782,016 22.1 Home equity 1,677,136 7.8 1,802,865 8.3 Other consumer 113,172 0.5 155,799 0.7 Total loans and leases $ 21,475,001 100.0 $ 21,641,215 100.0 

Total commercial non-mortgage and asset-based loans were $7.8 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting a decrease of $188.3 million from December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily the result of higher principal paydowns. 

Commercial real estate loans were $6.4 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting an increase of $88.0 million from December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of originations of $642.8 million, partially offset by loan payments. 

Equipment financing was $630.3 million at June 30, 2021, reflecting an increase of $28.1 million from December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of originations of $133.4 million, partially offset by loan payments. 

Residential loans were $4.9 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting an increase of $74.3 million from December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of originations of $1.0 billion, partially offset by loan payments. 

Total home equity and other consumer loans were $1.8 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting a decrease of $168.4 million from December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to continued net principal paydowns within the home equity lines. 

Credit Policies and Procedures 

Webster Bank has credit policies and procedures in place designed to support lending activity within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. To assist management with its review, reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans are generated using the Company's loan reporting systems. Webster has implemented incremental monitoring procedures in connection with COVID-19. 

Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate and service its debt. Assessment of management is a critical element of the underwriting process and overall credit decision. Once it is determined that the borrower&#8217;s management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen, current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay its agreed upon obligations. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. However, the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal amounts. 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. These real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan, the market in which the property is located, and the tenants of the property securing the loan. The properties securing the Company&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location, which reduces the Company's exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Management periodically utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio. 

Consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the risk characteristics of the portfolio. Policies and procedures, coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized structures spread across many different borrowers, minimize risk. Trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis with policies and procedures modified, or developed, as needed. Underwriting factors for mortgage and home equity loans include the borrower&#8217;s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, the loan amount relative to property value, and the borrower&#8217;s debt to income level, and are also influenced by regulatory requirements. Additionally, Webster Bank originates both qualified mortgage and non-qualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules. 

Loan Modifications 

Webster works with customers to modify loan agreements when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties. Webster will modify a loan in order to minimize the risk of loss and achieve the best possible outcome for both the borrower and the Company. Loan modifications can take various forms and include payment deferrals, rate reductions, covenant waivers, term extensions, or other action. Depending on the nature of modification, it may, or may not, be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). 

COVID-19 Payment Modification Activities 

The Company has accommodated over 2,500 customers impacted by COVID-19 through payment-related deferrals. As of June 30, 2021, loan balances associated with these modifications, in their deferral period, totaled approximately $133.1 million. This balance includes all loans associated with a customer relationship where at least one loan has been modified or is in process of modification. A significant portion of the loan balances associated with these modifications would not be considered a TDR based on the nature of the modification. Certain other modifications that would otherwise be considered a TDR are subject to TDR accounting relief through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and Interagency Statement. Included in the $133.1 million are the $120.3 million of loan balances associated with the CARES Act and Interagency Statement, as discussed below. The Company continues to actively monitor customer relationships associated with these modified loans. The impact of these modifications is reflected in our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. 

The CARES Act and Interagency Statement 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, financial institutions were provided relief from certain TDR accounting and disclosure requirements for qualifying loan modifications. Specifically, Section 4013 of the CARES Act, extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, provided temporary relief from certain GAAP requirements for modifications related to COVID-19. In addition, a group of banking regulatory agencies issued a revised Interagency Statement that offers practical expedients for evaluating whether COVID-19 loan modifications are TDRs. 

As of June 30, 2021, loan balances associated with loan modifications designated in connection with these relief provisions in their deferral period totaled approximately $120.3 million. These modifications represent payment deferrals, generally three to six months in length. The $16.7 million decrease from $137.0 million at March 31, 2021 is primarily the result of borrowers exiting their payment deferral period. The Company will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the loan modification program as the deferral periods end. For additional information on the accounting for loan modifications under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Webster's 2020 Form 10-K. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A modified loan is considered a TDR when two conditions are met: (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, and (ii) the modification constitutes a concession. Modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower. The Company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted, including the debtor's ability to access market rate funds. In general, a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms. Common modifications include material changes in covenants, pricing, and forbearance. Loans for which the borrower has been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent TDRs and thus, at the date of discharge, are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. 

The Company&#8217;s policy is to place consumer loan TDRs on non-accrual status for a minimum period of six months, except for those that were performing prior to TDR status. Commercial TDRs are evaluated on a case-by-case basis for determination of accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Generally, a TDR is classified and reported as a TDR for the remaining life of the loan. TDR classification may be removed if the loan was restructured under market conditions and the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum period of six months. In the limited circumstance that a TDR classification is removed, the loan is returned to the appropriate pool and credit losses are determined through the collective assessment process. 

The following tables provide information for loans classified as TDRs: Six months ended June 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 235,427 $ 237,438 Additions 3,820 52,385 Paydowns, net of draws (52,331) (23,997) Charge-offs (2,248) (3,084) Transfers to OREO (325) (1,296) Ending balance $ 184,343 $ 261,446

TDR balances decreased $51.1 million at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased paydown activity. Specific reserves for TDRs decreased from year end reflective of management&#8217;s current assessment of reserve requirements. Qualifying loan modifications in connection with Section 4013 of the CARES Act or Interagency Statement are excluded from TDR identification.

Asset Quality 

The Company manages its asset quality leveraging established risk tolerance levels through its underwriting standards, servicing, and portfolio management of loans and leases. Loans and leases, particularly where a heightened risk of loss has been identified, are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration that could potentially impact key measures of asset quality in future periods. Management considers past due loans and leases, non-performing assets, and credit loss levels to be key measures of asset quality. 

The following table provides key asset quality ratios: At June 30, 2021 At December 31, 2020 Non-performing loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases 0.56 % 0.78 % Non-performing assets as a percentage of loans and leases plus other real estate owned (OREO) 0.57 0.79 Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.37 0.52 ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases 255.05 213.94 ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases 1.43 1.66

These ratio calculations include the impact of PPP loans totaling $846.0 million and $1.3 billion for which there was no allowance for credit losses recorded at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Potential Problem Loans and Leases 

Potential problem loans and leases are defined by management as certain loans and leases that, for: 

&#8226; the commercial portfolio, are performing loans and leases classified as Substandard and have a well-defined weakness that could jeopardize the full repayment of the debt; and 

&#8226; the consumer portfolio, are performing loans that are accruing income and are 60-89 days past due. 

Potential problem loans and leases exclude loans and leases that are accruing income and are past due 90 days or more, non-accrual loans and leases, and TDRs. Certain loans with modifications related to COVID-19 are not reflected as potential problem loans and have not reported as TDRs due to relief provisions of the CARES Act and Interagency Statement, as discussed elsewhere in this section. As uncertainties related to the pandemic still exist, there is a risk that some of these modified loans may become potential problem loans at a later date. 

Management monitors potential problem loans and leases due to a higher degree of risk associated with those loans and leases. The current expectation of lifetime losses is included in the ACL on loans and leases, however management cannot predict whether these potential problem loans and leases ultimately will become non-performing or result in a loss. The Company had potential problem loans and leases of $259.1 million at June 30, 2021 as compared to $335.1 million at December 31, 2020. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

Methodology 

The Company's policy for ACL on loans and leases is considered a critical accounting policy. The ACL on loans and leases is a contra-asset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses expected to occur over the life of the asset. Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the reserve, which is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to cover expected losses within each of the loan and lease portfolios. 

The ACL on loans and leases is determined using the CECL model, which requires recognition of expected lifetime credit losses at the purchase or origination of an asset. Expected losses are determined through a pooled, collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics. If the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change and no longer match that of the collective assessment pool, it is removed and individually assessed for credit impairment. Management applies significant judgments and assumptions that influence the loss estimate and ACL on loan and lease balances. 

Collectively Assessed Loans and Leases . Collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on the commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a Probability of Default/Loss Given Default/Exposure at Default (PD/LGD/EAD) framework. Expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting, expected loss given the occurrence of a default, and the current exposure of a loan at default. Summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio. The Company&#8217;s PD and LGD calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, historical loss information, and credit risk ratings. The Company&#8217;s models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Macroeconomic variables are selected based on 

the correlation of the variables to credit losses for each class of financing receivable. Data from the baseline forecast scenario is used as the input to the model loss calculation. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical loss rates for the remaining life of the loans and leases on a straight-line basis over a one-year reversion period. The calculation of exposure at default follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of similar segment within the same portfolio. The calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses and principal paydown (PPD). PPD is the combination of contractual repayment and prepayment. A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics, which are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. 

Individually Assessed Loans and Leases . When loans and leases no longer match the risk characteristics of the collective assessment pool, they are removed from the collectively assessed population and individually assessed for credit losses. Generally, all non-accrual loans, TDRs, potential TDRs, loans with a charge-off, and collateral dependent loans when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, are individually assessed. Individual assessment calculations are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, the present value of the expected cash flows from operation of the collateral, discounted cash flows, or other individual assessment approach, as appropriate. 

A fair value shortfall relative to the amortized cost balance is reflected as an impairment reserve within the ACL on loans and leases. Subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate, should reliable information come to management's attention that the value has declined further, additional impairment may be recorded to reflect the particular situation, thereby increasing the ACL on loans and leases. Any individually assessed loan for which no specific valuation allowance was necessary is the result of either sufficient cash flow or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost. If the credit quality subsequently improves, the allowance is reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit loss. 

The ACL on loans and leases represents the total of estimated losses calculated through collective and individual assessments. To assist management with its review, reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans are generated using the Company's loan reporting systems. While actual future conditions and losses realized may vary significantly from present judgments and assumptions, management believes the ACL on loans and leases is adequate as of June 30, 2021. For additional information on the Company's ACL methodology, refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Webster's 2020 Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Balances and Ratios 

The ACL on loans and leases decreased $51.5 million, or 14.3%, from $359.4 million at December 31, 2020 to $307.9 million at June 30, 2021. The decrease in the allowance is primarily attributed to improvements in the forecasted economic outlook and favorable credit trends, resulting in a release of reserves. The ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases, also known as the reserve coverage ratio, decreased from 1.66% at December 31, 2020 to 1.43% at June 30, 2021. The ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases increased from 213.94% at December 31, 2020 to 255.05% at June 30, 2021, primarily due to the sale of $19.7 million of non-performing consumer and residential loans during the second quarter of 2021 and increased paydown activity. 

The following table provides information on the portfolio allocation of the ACL on loans and leases:

Sources of Funds and Liquidity 

Sources of Funds . The primary source of Webster Bank&#8217;s cash flows for use in lending and meeting its general operational needs is deposits. Operating activities, such as loan and mortgage-backed securities repayments, and other investment securities sale proceeds and maturities, also provide cash flows. While scheduled loan and investment securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, loan and investment securities prepayments and deposit inflows are influenced by prevailing interest rates, and local economic conditions and are inherently uncertain. Additional sources of funds are provided by FHLB advances or other borrowings. 

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of eleven district Federal Home Loan Banks, each subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. An activity-based capital stock investment in the FHLB of Boston is required in order for Webster Bank to access advances and other extensions of credit for sources of funds and liquidity purposes. The FHLB capital stock investment is restricted in that there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FHLB. Webster Bank held FHLB Boston capital stock of $16.6 million at June 30, 2021 compared to $17.5 million at December 31, 2020 for its FHLB membership and for outstanding advances and other extensions of credit. The most recent FHLB quarterly cash dividend was paid on May 4, 2021 in an amount equal to an annual yield of 1.54%. 

Additionally, Webster Bank is required to hold FRB of Boston stock equal to 6% of its capital and surplus of which 50% is paid. The remaining 50% is subject to call when deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve System. The FRB capital stock investment is restricted in that there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FRB. Webster Bank held $60.3 million and $60.1 million of FRB capital stock at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The most recent FRB semi-annual cash dividend was paid on June 30, 2021 in an amount equal to an annual yield of 1.50%. 

Deposits. Webster Bank offers a wide variety of deposit products for checking and savings (including: ATM and debit card use, direct deposit, ACH payments, mobile banking services, internet-based banking, bank by mail, as well as overdraft protection via line of credit or transfer from another deposit account) designed to meet the transactional, savings, and investment needs for both consumer and business customers throughout its primary market area. HSA Bank, a division of Webster Bank, specifically provides deposit products for HSAs, health reimbursement accounts, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits. Webster Bank manages the flow of funds in its deposit accounts and provides a variety of accounts and rates consistent with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulations. Webster Bank&#8217;s Retail Pricing Committee and its Commercial and Institutional Loan and Liability Pricing Committee meet regularly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives. 

Total deposits were $28.8 billion at June 30, 2021 as compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to a combination of an increase in transactional accounts of $1.8 billion due to customer PPP loan funding pending utilization, other stimulus effects, and lower customer spending. Refer to Note 9: Deposits in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information. 

Borrowings. FHLB advances are utilized as a source of funding for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. FHLB advances totaled $0.1 billion at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Webster Bank had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion from the FHLB at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and $1.3 billion from the FRB at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, whereby securities are delivered to counterparties under an agreement to repurchase such securities at a fixed price in the future, are also utilized as a source of funding. Unpledged investment securities of $4.5 billion at June 30, 2021 could have been used for collateral on borrowings such as repurchase agreements, or to increase borrowing capacity by approximately $4.2 billion or $4.4 billion at the FHLB or FRB, respectively. Additionally, Webster Bank may utilize term and overnight federal funds to meet short-term liquidity needs. 

Long-term debt, which consists of senior fixed-rate notes maturing in 2024 and 2029, and junior subordinated notes maturing in 2033, totaled $0.6 billion at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Total borrowed funds were $1.2 billion at June 30, 2021 as compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020, and represented 3.6% and 5.2% of total assets at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease is due to deposit growth exceeding loan and securities growth. For additional information, refer to Note 10: Borrowings in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

Liquidity . Webster meets its cash flow requirements at an efficient cost under various operating environments through proactive liquidity management at both the Holding Company and Webster Bank. Liquidity comes from a variety of cash flow sources, such as operating activities, including principal and interest payments on loans and securities, or financing activities, including unpledged investment securities that can be sold or utilized to secure funding, and new deposits. Webster is committed to maintaining a strong, increasing base of core deposits, consisting of demand, checking, savings, health savings, and money market accounts, to support growth in its loan and lease portfolio. Liquidity is reviewed and managed in order to maintain stable, cost effective funding to promote overall balance sheet strength. 

Holding Company Liquidity. The primary source of liquidity at the Holding Company is dividends from Webster Bank. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, Webster Bank paid $120.0 million in dividends to the Holding Company. To a lesser extent, investment income, net proceeds from investment sales, borrowings, and public offerings may provide additional liquidity. The main uses of liquidity are the payment of principal and interest to holders of senior notes and junior subordinated debt, the payment of dividends to preferred and common shareholders, repurchases of its common stock, and purchases of investment securities. There are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by Webster Bank to the Holding Company, which are described in the section captioned "Supervision and Regulation" in Item 1 of Webster&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. At June 30, 2021, there was $379.8 million of retained earnings available for the payment of dividends by Webster Bank to the Holding Company. 

The Company has a common stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors with $123.4 million of remaining repurchase authority at June 30, 2021. Due to the Company's announcement of its pending merger agreement with Sterling, Webster may not purchase any shares under this program until the transaction is closed. Additionally, the Company periodically acquires common shares outside of the repurchase program related to stock compensation plan activity. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, a total of 71,903 shares of common stock were repurchased at a market value of approximately $4.0 million. 

Webster Bank Liquidity. Webster Bank's primary source of funding is core deposits, which are used to support loan portfolio growth. Including time deposits, Webster Bank had a loan to total deposit ratio of 74.4% and 79.2% at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Webster Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain liquidity sufficient to ensure safe and sound operations. Whether liquidity is adequate, as assessed by the OCC, depends on factors such as the overall asset/liability structure, market conditions, competition, and the nature of the institution&#8217;s deposit and loan customers. Webster Bank exceeded all regulatory liquidity requirements as of June 30, 2021. The Company has a detailed liquidity contingency plan designed to respond to liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner. The plan is designed to provide early detection of potential problems and details specific actions required to address liquidity stress scenarios. 

As an OCC regulated commercial institution, Webster Bank is also required to satisfy certain minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, as well as minimum tangible capital requirements. As of June 30, 2021, Webster Bank was in compliance with all applicable capital requirements and exceeded the FDIC requirements for a well-capitalized institution. Refer to Note 12: Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for a further discussion of regulatory requirements applicable to the Holding Company and Webster Bank. 

The liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to balance between sources and uses of funds, as deemed appropriate. Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Webster engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded in the financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. Such transactions are utilized in the normal course of business for general corporate purposes or for customer financing needs. Corporate purpose transactions are structured to manage credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks, or to optimize capital. Customer transactions are structured to manage their funding requirements or facilitate certain trade arrangements. These transactions give rise to elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. For additional information, refer to Note 2: Variable Interest Entities and Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk 

An effective asset/liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short-term and long-term interest rate risks in determining management's strategy and action. To facilitate and manage this process, interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Company's ALCO. The impact has not been calculated for scenarios that would require negative interest rates. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points might have on NII over a twelve month period, starting at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 for each subsequent twelve month period as compared to NII, assuming no change in interest rates: 

NII -200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp June 30, 2021 n/a n/a 5.4% 11.6% December 31, 2020 n/a n/a 1.7% 4.7% 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points might have on PPNR over a twelve month period, starting at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 for each subsequent twelve month period as compared to PPNR, assuming no change in interest rates: 

PPNR -200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp June 30, 2021 n/a n/a 8.8% 19.0% December 31, 2020 n/a n/a 2.4% 7.1% 

Interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion, and the NII and PPNR results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate based scenario. The flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecasted horizon. Such scenario at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 assumed a federal funds rate of 0.25%. Asset sensitivity for both NII and PPNR increased at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in deposit beta assumptions, which were approved by the Company's ALCO and are reflective of management's current deposit pricing strategy. Loans at floors have increased to approximately $4.0 billion at June 30, 2021, lowering overall asset sensitivity, but is being offset by increased cash levels at the FRB due to elevated deposits. When interest rates start to rise, not all of these loans will immediately lift off of their floors. Due to the lower rate environment at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, management does not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were previously modeled when market rates were higher. 

Webster can also hold futures, options, and forward foreign currency contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain assets and liabilities. Changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in earnings. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates might have on NII for the subsequent twelve month period starting at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve NII -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp June 30, 2021 n/a n/a 3.6% 7.9% (3.1)% (1.5)% 1.4% 2.8% December 31, 2020 n/a n/a 0.2% 1.5% n/a (2.2)% 1.0% 2.5% 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates might have on PPNR for the subsequent twelve month period starting at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve PPNR -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp June 30, 2021 n/a n/a 6.0% 13.1% (5.1)% (2.6)% 2.4% 4.6% December 31, 2020 n/a n/a (0.3)% 1.7% n/a (4.0)% 1.8% 4.4% 

These non-parallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down 50 and 100 basis points, while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged, and vice versa. The short end of the yield curve is defined as terms of less than eighteen months, whereas the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms of greater than eighteen months. The results above reflect the annualized impact of immediate rate changes. 

Sensitivity to the short end of the yield curve for both NII and PPNR increased at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 due to excess cash at the FRB. As rates rise, this cash can be deployed into higher yielding assets. NII and PPNR were less sensitive to changes in the long end of the yield curve at June 30, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, due to slower forecast prepayment speeds resulting from increases in the long end of the yield curve, which shortens asset duration for MBS 

and residential mortgages. Due to the lower rate environment at June 30, 2021, management does not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were modeled at December 31, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the estimated economic value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and the projected change to economic values if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points: 

(Dollars in thousands) Book Value Estimated Economic Value Estimated Economic Value Change -100 bp +100 bp June 30, 2021 Assets $ 33,753,752 $ 33,481,272 n/a $ (726,608) Liabilities 30,424,047 29,437,861 n/a (1,010,173) Net $ 3,329,705 $ 4,043,411 n/a $ 283,565 Net change as % base net economic value n/a 7.0 % December 31, 2020 Assets $ 32,590,690 $ 32,546,388 n/a $ (625,173) Liabilities 29,356,065 29,357,878 n/a (1,058,460) Net $ 3,234,625 $ 3,188,510 n/a $ 433,287 Net change as % base net economic value n/a 13.6 % 

Changes in economic value can best be described using duration, which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments for small changes in interest rates. For fixed-rate instruments, it can also be thought of as the weighted-average expected time to receive future cash flows, whereas for floating-rate instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time until the next rate reset. The longer the duration, the greater the price sensitivity for given changes in interest rates. Floating-rate instruments may have durations as short as one day, and therefore, may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. Increases in interest rates typically reduce the value of fixed-rate assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher discount rates. A liability's value decreases for the same reason in a rising rate environment. A reduction in the value of a liability is a benefit to the Company. 

Duration gap is the difference between the duration of assets and the duration of liabilities. A duration gap near zero implies that the balance sheet is matched, and thus would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for a small change in interest rates. Webster's duration gap was negative 2.1 years and negative 1.9 years at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. A negative duration gap implies that liabilities are longer than assets, and therefore, have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace. Consequently, Webster's net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of assets. The opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall. Earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and, in turn, decrease when interest rates fall over the longer term absent the effects of new business booked in the future. At June 30, 2021, long-term rates have risen by 52 basis points as compared to December 31, 2020. This higher starting point lengthens asset duration by decreasing residential loan and MBS prepayment speeds. 

These estimates assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates. Both the earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ. Management believes that Webster's interest rate risk position at June 30, 2021 represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook. Management is prepared to take additional action in the event that interest rates do change rapidly. 

For a detailed description of the Company's asset/liability management process, refer to the section captioned "Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results principally in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 

Unlike most industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on Webster's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in its 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Modifications to significant accounting policies, if made during the year, are described in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Management has identified that the Company's most critical accounting policy is the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases not only because of its importance to the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results, but also the fact that it requires management&#8217;s subjective and complex judgment surrounding the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Accounting policies and estimates, including the nature of the estimates and types of assumptions used, are described throughout Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Webster's 2020 Form 10-K, and Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, and related Notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments are reflected to present fairly the financial position and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods shown. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained during the full year ending December 31, 2021, or any future period. There have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from those described within that Form 10-K, except as described within the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates section of this note. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. These reclassifications did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates 

ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. 

The Accounting Standards Update (the Update) provides simplification to the accounting for income taxes related to a variety of topics and makes minor codification improvements. Changes include a requirement that the effects of an enacted change in tax law be reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the new legislation and clarification on presentation of non-income based taxes. 

The Company adopted the Update on January 1, 2021 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Scope. 

The Update clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions provided for in ASU No. 2020-04 for applying GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. The Update was effective upon issuance for application on either a retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 22, 2020, or on a prospective basis beginning on January 7, 2021. 

The Company adopted the Update on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 

The Company has adopted all applicable Accounting Standards Updates issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as of June 30, 2021. 

Note 2: Variable Interest Entities 

The Company has an investment interest in the following entities that meet the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE). 

Consolidated 

Rabbi Trust. The Company established a Rabbi Trust to meet the obligations due under its Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned plan. The funding of the Rabbi Trust and the discontinuation of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers occurred during 2012. 

Investments held in the Rabbi Trust primarily consist of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the Rabbi Trust as it has the power to direct the activities of the Rabbi Trust that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The Company consolidates the invested assets of the trust along with the total deferred compensation obligations and includes them in accrued interest receivable and other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Earnings in the Rabbi Trust, including appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as other non-interest income, and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as compensation and benefits, on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 15: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 

Non-Consolidated 

Tax Credit - Finance Investments. The Company makes non-marketable equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects and provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits. In most instances, the investments require the funding of capital commitments in the future. While the Company's investment in an entity may exceed 50% of its outstanding equity interests, the entity is not consolidated as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs and the Company does not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's tax credit-finance investments was $ 44.7 million and $ 37.2 million, respectively, which represents the Company's maximum exposure to loss. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, unfunded commitments have been recognized, totaling $ 12.7 million and $ 10.2 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Webster Statutory Trust. The Company owns all the outstanding common stock of Webster Statutory Trust, a financial vehicle that has issued, and in the future may issue, trust preferred securities. The trust is a VIE in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The trust's only assets are junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company, which were acquired by the trust using the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common stock. The junior subordinated debentures are included in long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related interest expense is reported as interest expense on long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 10: Borrowings for additional information. 

Other Non-Marketable Investments. The Company invests in various alternative investments in which it holds a variable interest. These investments are non-public entities which cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. For these investments, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. 

At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's other non-marketable investments in VIEs was $ 44.7 million and $ 34.3 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss of the Company's other non-marketable investments in VIEs, including unfunded commitments, was $ 78.2 million and $ 72.7 million, respectively. Refer to Note 15: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 

The Company's equity interests in Other Non-Marketable Investments, as well as Tax Credit-Finance Investments and Webster Statutory Trust, are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For a description of the Company's accounting policy regarding the consolidation of VIEs, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Note 3: Business Developments 

Pending Merger 

On April 19, 2021, Webster and Sterling announced that their boards of directors approved by unanimous vote a definitive agreement under which the two companies will combine in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Sterling will merge into Webster, and Sterling's shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.463 of a Webster common share for each share of Sterling common stock owned. In addition, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Sterling's Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive a newly created series of Webster preferred stock having substantially the same terms. 

The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of Webster and Sterling. In connection with the proposed transaction, the Company incurred $ 17.1 million of merger-related expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily consisting of professional fees for investment banking, legal, accounting, and employee retention costs. Merger-related expenses are recorded as either professional and outside services, compensation and benefits, or other non-interest expense on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, and are presented in the Corporate and Reconciling category for segment reporting purposes. 

Strategic Initiatives 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company launched a strategic plan to drive incremental revenue and cost savings measures across the organization through the consolidation of banking centers and corporate facilities, process automation, ancillary spend reduction, and other organizational actions. 

The following table presents the changes in reserves associated with the Company's strategic initiatives for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021:

(1) Amortized cost excludes accrued interest receivable of $ 20.9 million and $ 22.1 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Agency securities represent obligations issued by a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or other federally-related entity and are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed, and therefore, assumed to be zero loss. Securities with unrealized losses and no allowance are considered to be of high credit quality, and therefore, zero credit loss is recorded as of June 30, 2021. The current unrealized loss position of certain agency securities and non-agency CMBS with no credit loss allowance can be attributed to the changing interest rate environment. An allowance for credit losses on investment securities held-to-maturity is recorded for certain Municipal bonds and notes to account for expected lifetime credit losses. 

The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses on investment securities held-to-maturity: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Balance beginning of period $ 308 $ 312 $ 299 $ &#8212; Adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 (CECL) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 397 Provision (benefit) for credit losses 74 ( 3 ) 83 ( 88 ) Balance end of period $ 382 $ 309 $ 382 $ 309 

Credit Quality Information 

The Company monitors the credit quality of held-to-maturity debt securities through credit ratings provided by Standard &#38; Poor's Rating Services (S&#38;P), Moody's Investor Services (Moody's), Fitch Ratings, Inc., Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or DBRS Inc. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security. Investment grade securities are rated BBB- or higher by S&#38;P, or Baa3 or higher by Moody's, and are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be of low credit risk. Conversely, securities rated below investment grade, labeled as speculative grade by the rating agencies, are considered to have distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade securities. At June 30, 2021, there were no held-to-maturity investment securities rated below investment grade. The securities illustrated below that are not rated are collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and credit quality indicators are updated at each quarter end. 

The following table summarizes credit ratings for the amortized cost of held-to-maturity debt securities according to their lowest public credit rating at June 30, 2021:

Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities presented in the previous table have not been recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income based on impairment analysis. The Company does not intend and is not required to sell prior to their anticipated recovery because the securities are investment grade, and the decline in fair value is primarily attributable to higher market rates. Fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity. At June 30, 2021, there were no available-for-sale investment securities in non-accrual status.

Credit Quality Indicators. To measure credit risk for the commercial portfolio, the Company employs a dual grade credit risk grading system for estimating the PD and LGD. The credit risk grade system assigns a rating to each borrower and to the facility, which together form a Composite Credit Risk Profile. The credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics. The Composite Credit Risk Profile has ten grades, with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss. Grades (1) to (6) are considered pass ratings, and grades (7) to (10) are considered criticized, as defined by the regulatory agencies. Risk ratings assigned in order to differentiate risk within the portfolio are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrowers&#8217; current financial position and outlook, risk profile, and the related collateral and structural position. Loan officers review updated financial information on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade. Criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring. A (7) - "Special Mention" rating has the potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit. An (8) - "Substandard" rating has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt. A (9) - "Doubtful" rating has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard credit with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full improbably, given current facts, conditions, and values.

To measure credit risk for the consumer portfolio, the most relevant credit characteristic is the FICO score, which is a widely used credit scoring system that ranges from 300 to 850. A lower FICO score is indicative of higher credit risk. FICO scores are updated at least quarterly.

Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is substantially expected through the operation or sale of collateral. A collateral dependent loan is individually assessed based on the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, as of the reporting date. Commercial non-mortgage, asset based, and equipment financing loans are collateralized by equipment, inventory, receivables, or other non-real estate assets. Commercial real estate, residential, and home equity loans are collateralized by real estate. Collateral value on collateral dependent loans and leases was $ 107.0 million at June 30, 2021 and $ 150.3 million at December 31, 2020.

Note 6: Transfers of Financial Assets 

The Company sells financial assets in the normal course of business, primarily residential mortgage loans sold to government-sponsored enterprises through established programs and securitizations. Residential mortgage origination fees, adjustments for changes in fair value, and gains or losses on loans sold are included as mortgage banking activities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Company may be required to repurchase a loan in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties, or in the event of default of the borrower within 90 days of sale, as provided for in the sale agreements. A reserve for loan repurchases provides for estimated losses pertaining to the potential repurchase of loans associated with the Company&#8217;s mortgage banking activities. The reserve reflects loan repurchase requests received by the Company for which management evaluates the identity of the counterparty, the vintage of the loans sold, the amount of open repurchase requests, specific loss estimates for each open request, the current level of loan losses in similar vintages held in the residential loan portfolio, and estimated recoveries on the underlying collateral. The reserve also reflects management&#8217;s expectation of losses from loan repurchase requests for which the Company has not yet been notified. The provision recorded at the time of the loan sale is netted from the gain or loss recorded in mortgage banking activities, while any incremental provision, post loan sale, is recorded in other non-interest expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 12: Regulatory Matters 

Capital Requirements 

Webster Financial Corporation is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve System, while Webster Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC. Regulatory authorities can initiate certain mandatory actions if either Webster Financial Corporation or Webster Bank fail to meet minimum capital requirements, which could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. These quantitative measures require minimum amounts and ratios to ensure capital adequacy. 

Total risk-based capital is comprised of three categories as defined by Basel III capital rules: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital includes common shareholders' equity, less deductions for goodwill, other intangibles, and certain deferred tax adjustments. For purposes of CET1 capital, common shareholders' equity excludes AOCI (AOCL) components as permitted by the opt-out election taken by Webster upon adoption of Basel III. Tier 1 capital is comprised of CET1 capital plus perpetual preferred stock, while Tier 2 capital includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses, that together equal total capital.

(1) In accordance with regulatory capital rules, the Company elected an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of CECL on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral period and subsequent three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. As a result, capital ratios and amounts exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses on loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and unfunded loan commitments attributed to the adoption of CECL, adjusted for an approximation of the after-tax provision for credit losses attributable to CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology during the deferral period. 

Dividend Restrictions. Webster Financial Corporation is dependent upon dividends from Webster Bank to provide funds for its cash requirements, including payments of dividends to shareholders. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations. Express approval by the OCC is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank to fall below specified minimum levels, or would exceed the net income for that year combined with the undistributed net income for the preceding two years. Webster Bank paid $ 120.0 million in dividends to Webster Financial Corporation during the six months ended June 30, 2021, whereas no dividends were paid during the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Cash Restrictions. Webster Bank is required by Federal Reserve System regulations to hold cash reserve balances on hand or with a Federal Reserve Bank. To address liquidity concerns due to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve reset the requirement to zero. The reserve requirement ratio remains subject to adjustment as conditions warrant. 

Note 13: Earnings Per Common Share 

A reconciliation of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows: &#160; Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per common share: Net income $ 94,035 &#160; $ 53,097 &#160; $ 202,113 &#160; $ 91,296 &#160; Less: Preferred stock dividends 1,969 &#160; 1,969 &#160; 3,938 &#160; 3,938 &#160; Net income available to common shareholders 92,066 &#160; 51,128 &#160; 198,175 &#160; 87,358 &#160; Less: Earnings applicable to participating securities (1)

(1) Earnings per common share amounts under the two-class method for unvested time-based restricted stock with non-forfeitable dividends and dividend rights are computed the same as the presentation above. 

Dilutive Securities 

Webster maintains stock compensation plans under which restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and directors. The effect of dilutive securities for the periods presented is attributed to outstanding stock options and non-participating, performance-based restricted stock. 

Potential common shares from non-participating, performance-based restricted stock of 55 thousand and 192 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 28 thousand and 114 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are excluded from the effect of dilutive securities because they would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. 

Note 14: Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative Positions and Offsetting 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships . Interest rate swaps allow the Company to change the fixed or variable nature of an interest rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Certain pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges to effectively convert variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt, while certain receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges to effectively convert fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate debt. Certain purchased options are designated as cash flow hedges. Purchased options allow the Company to limit the potential adverse impact of variable interest rates by establishing a cap or floor rate in exchange for an upfront premium. The purchased options designated as cash flow hedges represent interest rate caps where payment is received from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the cap rate, and interest rate floors where payment is received from the counterparty when interest rates fall below the floor rate. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships. The Company also enters into other derivative transactions to manage economic risks, but does not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Further, the Company enters into derivative contracts to accommodate customer needs. Derivative contracts with customers are offset with dealer counterparty transactions structured with matching terms to ensure minimal impact on earnings.

Purchased options designated as cash flow hedges exclude time-value premiums from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Time-value premiums are amortized on a straight-line basis. At June 30, 2021, the remaining unamortized balance of time-value premiums was $ 8.6 million. 

Over the next twelve months, an estimated $ 10.5 million decrease to interest expense will be reclassified from AOCI (AOCL) relating to cash flow hedges, and an estimated $ 0.3 million increase to interest expense will be reclassified from AOCI (AOCL) relating to hedge terminations. At June 30, 2021, the remaining unamortized loss on terminated cash flow hedges is $ 0.8 million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 3.1 years. 

Additional information about cash flow hedge activity impacting AOCI (AOCL) and the related amounts reclassified to interest expense is provided in Note 11: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax. Information about the valuation methods used to measure the fair value of derivatives is provided in Note 15: Fair Value Measurements. 

Derivative Exposure 

At June 30, 2021, the Company had $ 72.7 million in initial margin collateral posted at CME. In addition, $ 32.2 million of cash collateral received is included in cash and due from banks on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Webster regularly evaluates the credit risk of its derivative customers, taking into account the likelihood of default, net exposures, and remaining contractual life, among other related factors. Credit risk exposure is mitigated as transactions with customers are generally secured by the same collateral of the underlying transactions. Current net credit exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers was $ 191.0 million at June 30, 2021. In addition, the Company monitors potential future exposure, representing its best estimate of exposure to remaining contractual maturity. The potential future exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers totaled $ 36.0 million at June 30, 2021. The Company incorporates a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and debit valuation adjustment (DVA) to reflect nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. Various factors impact changes in the CVA and DVA over time, including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts, as well as changes in market rates and volatilities, which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments. 

Note 15: Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined using quoted market prices. However, in many instances, quoted market prices are not available. In such instances, fair values are determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques. Accordingly, categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate transfer of the respective asset or liability. 

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings or any part of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These factors are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1: Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

&#8226; Level 2: Fair value is calculated using significant inputs other than quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. The valuation may rely on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, rate volatility, prepayment speeds, credit ratings,) or inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by market data, correlation, or other means. 

&#8226; Level 3: Inputs for determining the fair value of the respective assets or liabilities are not observable. Level 3 valuations are reliant upon pricing models and techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Available-for-Sale Investment Securities . When quoted prices are available in an active market, the Company classifies available-for-sale investment securities within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. Treasury Bills are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations, or methodologies, that appear unusual or unexpected. Available-for-Sale investment securities which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, CLO, and corporate debt, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative Instruments . Foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

All other derivative instruments are valued using third-party valuation software, which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions. The resulting fair value is validated against valuations performed by independent third parties and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Banking Derivatives . Forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are utilized by the Company in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Prior to closing and funding certain single-family residential mortgage loans, an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower. During the period from commitment date to closing date, the Company is subject to the risk that market rates of interest may change. If market rates rise, investors generally will pay less to purchase such loans resulting in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or, possibly, a loss. In an effort to mitigate such risk, forward delivery sales commitments are established, under which the Company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgage-backed securities. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and, therefore, classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Originated Loans Held For Sale . Residential mortgage loans typically are classified as held for sale upon origination based on management's intent to sell such loans. The Company generally records residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 825 "Financial Instruments." Electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivatives used as an economic hedge on these assets. The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions. Accordingly, such loans are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table compares the fair value to unpaid principal balance of assets accounted for under the fair value option: At June 30, 2021 At December 31, 2020 (In thousands) Fair Value Unpaid Principal Balance Difference Fair Value Unpaid Principal Balance Difference Originated loans held for sale $ 4,335 &#160; $ 4,845 &#160; $ ( 510 ) $ 14,000 &#160; $ 13,511 &#160; $ 489 &#160; 

Investments Held in Rabbi Trust. Investments held in the Rabbi Trust primarily include open-ended mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. Shares of mutual funds are valued based on net asset value, which represents quoted market prices for the underlying shares held in the mutual funds. Therefore, investments held in the Rabbi Trust are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has elected to measure the investments held in the Rabbi Trust at fair value. The cost basis of the investments held in the Rabbi Trust is $ 1.6 million at June 30, 2021. 

Alternative Investments. Equity investments have a readily determinable fair value when quoted prices are available in an active market. Accordingly, such alternative investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for net asset value (NAV) practical expedient measurement, based on specific requirements. The Company's alternative investments accounted for at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investments are distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Alternative investments recorded at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2021, these alternative investments had a remaining unfunded commitment of $ 17.6 million. 

A summary of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis is as follows: &#160; At June 30, 2021 (In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Agency CMO $ &#8212; &#160; $ 120,328 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 120,328 &#160; Agency MBS &#8212; &#160; 1,382,530 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,382,530 &#160; Agency CMBS &#8212; &#160; 941,397 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 941,397 &#160; CMBS &#8212; &#160; 754,970 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 754,970 &#160; CLO &#8212; &#160; 49,964 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 49,964 &#160; Corporate debt &#8212; &#160; 13,704 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13,704 &#160; Total available-for-sale investment securities &#8212; &#160; 3,262,893 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,262,893 &#160; Gross derivative instruments, before netting (1)

(1) For information relating to the impact of netting derivative assets and derivative liabilities, as well as the impact from offsetting cash collateral paid to the same derivative counterparties, refer to Note 14: Derivative Financial Instruments. 

(2) Alternative investments are recorded at NAV. Assets measured at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. At June 30, 2021, no significant assets classified within Level 3 were identified and measured under this basis. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured on a non-recurring basis. 

Alternative Investments. The measurement alternative has been elected for alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the NAV practical expedient. The measurement alternative requires investments to be accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. These alternative investments are investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Accordingly, these alternative investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of these alternative investments was $ 19.9 million at June 30, 2021, which is inclusive of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.2 million measured at fair value where there was a $ 0.1 million write-up due to an observable price change and a $ 0.3 million write-down due to impairment, respectively. No other adjustments were identified during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases. Loans and leases for which the payment is expected to be provided solely by the value of the underlying collateral are considered collateral dependent and are valued based on the estimated fair value of such collateral, less estimated cost to sell, using customized discounting criteria. Accordingly, such collateral dependent loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) and Repossessed Assets. The total book value of OREO and repossessed assets was $ 2.8 million at June 30, 2021. OREO and repossessed assets are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when recorded below cost. The fair value of OREO is based on independent appraisals or internal valuation methods, less estimated selling costs. The valuation may consider available pricing guides, auction results, and price opinions. Certain assets require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market in the determination of fair value; as such, OREO and repossessed assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

In addition, the amortized cost of consumer loans secured by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure amounted to $ 9.9 million at June 30, 2021. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Servicing Assets 

The Company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, as well as for servicing assets. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities. 

Cash, Due from Banks, and Interest-bearing Deposits . The carrying amount of cash, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits is used to approximate fair value given the short time frame to maturity, and as such, these assets do not present unanticipated credit concerns. Cash, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities . When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations or methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected. Held-to-Maturity investment securities, which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, and municipal bonds and notes, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans and Leases, net . The estimated fair value of loans and leases held for investment is calculated using a discounted cash flow method based on future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity premium for comparable loans and leases. The associated cash flows are adjusted for credit and other potential losses. Fair value for collateral dependent loans and leases is estimated using the net present value of the expected cash flows. Loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Deposit Liabilities . The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Deposit liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Time Deposits . The fair value of a fixed-maturity certificate of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Time deposits are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings . The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings that mature within 90 days is equal to the carrying value. Fair value for all other balances are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates adjusted for associated credit risks, as appropriate. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt . The fair value of FHLB advances and long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique. Discount rates are matched with the time period of the expected cash flows and are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect credit risk. FHLB advances and long-term debt are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Assets . Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured under the amortization method. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future net servicing income and relies on market based assumptions for loan prepayment speeds, servicing costs, discount rates, and other economic factors. As such, the primary risk inherent in valuing mortgage servicing assets is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the related servicing revenue stream. Mortgage servicing assets are reviewed quarterly and held at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Fair value adjustments, if any, are included as a component of loan related fees in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Mortgage servicing assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The carrying amounts, estimated fair values, and classifications within the fair value hierarchy of selected financial instruments and servicing assets are summarized as follows:

Note 17: Segment Reporting 

Webster's operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses: Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Retail Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, how discrete financial information is evaluated, the type of customer served, and how products and services are provided. Certain Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Effective January 1, 2021, management realigned certain of the Company's business banking and investment services operations to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. The previously reported Community Banking segment was also renamed as Retail Banking. Under this realignment, $ 131.0 million of goodwill was reallocated, on a relative fair value basis, from Retail Banking to Commercial Banking. There was no goodwill impairment as a result of the reorganization. Prior period amounts have been recasted to reflect the realignment. 

Description of Segment Reporting Methodology 

Webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by reportable segment, which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing, and allocations for non-interest expense, provision for credit losses, income taxes, and equity capital. These estimates and allocations, certain of which are subjective in nature, are periodically reviewed and refined. Changes in estimates and allocations that affect the results of any reportable segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Webster as a whole. The full profitability measurement reports, which are prepared for each reportable segment, reflect non-GAAP reporting methodologies. The differences between full profitability and GAAP results are reconciled in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business, through an internal matched maturity Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) process. The goal of the FTP allocation is to encourage loan and deposit growth consistent with the Company&#8217;s overall profitability objectives. The FTP process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business. Loans are assigned an FTP rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an FTP rate for funds provided. The allocation considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign an FTP rate for loans and deposits originated each day. The FTP process transfers the corporate interest rate risk exposure to the treasury function included within the Corporate and Reconciling category where such exposures are centrally managed. 

Webster allocates a majority of non-interest expense to each reportable segment using a full-absorption costing process. Costs, including corporate overhead, are analyzed, pooled by process, and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment. Business development costs are generally included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

The results of funds transfer pricing and allocations for non-interest expense, as well as non-interest income produces pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue, under which basis the segments are reviewed by executive management. 

Webster also allocates the provision for credit losses to each reportable segment based on management's estimate of the inherent loss content in each of the specific loan and lease portfolios. Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is included in total assets within the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

The following table presents balance sheet information, including all appropriate allocations, for Webster's reportable segments and the Corporate and Reconciling category: At June 30, 2021 (In thousands) Commercial Banking HSA Bank Retail Banking Corporate and Reconciling Consolidated Total Goodwill $ 131,000 &#160; $ 21,813 &#160; $ 385,560 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 538,373 &#160; Total assets $ 14,837,710 &#160; $ 78,054 &#160; $ 7,432,340 &#160; $ 11,405,648 &#160; $ 33,753,752 &#160; At December 31, 2020 (In thousands) Commercial Banking HSA Bank Retail Banking Corporate and Reconciling Consolidated Total Goodwill $ 131,000 &#160; $ 21,813 &#160; $ 385,560 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 538,373 &#160; Total assets $ 14,732,792 &#160; $ 80,352 &#160; $ 7,726,287 &#160; $ 10,051,259 &#160; $ 32,590,690 &#160;

The major sources of revenue from contracts with customers are described below: 

Deposit service fees predominately consist of fees earned from deposit accounts and interchange fees. Fees earned from deposit accounts relate to event-driven services and periodic account maintenance activities. Webster's obligations for event-driven services are satisfied at the time the service is delivered, while the obligations for maintenance services are satisfied monthly. Interchange fees are assessed as the performance obligation is satisfied, which is the point in time that the card transaction is authorized. 

Wealth and investment services consists of fees earned from investment and securities-related services, trust, and other related services. Obligations for wealth and investment services are generally satisfied over time through a time-based measurement of progress, but certain obligations may be satisfied at points in time for activities that are transactional in nature. 

These disaggregated amounts are reconciled to non-interest income as presented within Note 17: Segment Reporting. Contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities. 

Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 

The Company offers credit-related financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet certain financing needs of its customers, that involve off-balance sheet risk. These transactions may include an unused commitment to extend credit, standby letter of credit, or a commercial letter of credit. Such transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. 

Commitments to Extend Credit . The Company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to customers at a future point in time. These commitments include revolving credit arrangements, term loan commitments, and short-term borrowing agreements. Most of these loans have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses where a fee may be required. Since commitments routinely expire without being funded, or after required availability of collateral occurs, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 

Standby Letters of Credit . A standby letter of credit commits the Company to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. The Company has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit, which is often part of a larger credit agreement under which security is provided. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of a standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the Company could be required to make, and is the Company's maximum credit risk. 

Commercial Letters of Credit . A commercial letter of credit is issued to facilitate either domestic or foreign trade arrangements for customers. As a general rule, drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. Similar to a standby letter of credit, a commercial letter of credit is often secured by an underlying security agreement including the assets or inventory to which they relate. 

The following table summarizes the outstanding amounts of credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk: (In thousands) At June 30, 2021 At December 31, 2020 Commitments to extend credit $ 7,143,906 &#160; $ 6,517,840 &#160; Standby letters of credit 213,751 &#160; 207,201 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 50,120 &#160; 30,522 &#160; Total credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk $ 7,407,777 &#160; $ 6,755,563 &#160; 

These commitments subject the Company to potential exposure in excess of amounts recorded in the financial statements, and therefore, management maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for expected losses in connection with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend when those commitments are not unconditionally cancellable by Webster. Loss calculation factors are consistent with the ACL methodology for funded loans using PD and LGD applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades, a draw down factor applied to utilization rates, and relevant forecast information. This allowance is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The following table provides a summary of activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments:
