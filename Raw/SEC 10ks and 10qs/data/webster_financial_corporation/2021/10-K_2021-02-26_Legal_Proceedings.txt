 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time Webster Financial Corporation, or its subsidiaries, are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. Management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not be material to Webster or its consolidated financial position. Webster establishes an accrual for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur that could cause Webster to adjust its litigation accrual or could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or operating results. Webster believes it has defenses to all claims asserted against it in existing litigation matters and intends to defend itself in those matters.
