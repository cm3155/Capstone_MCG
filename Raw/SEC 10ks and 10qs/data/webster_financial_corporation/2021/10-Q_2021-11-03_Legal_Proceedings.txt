 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, Webster Financial Corporation, or its subsidiaries, are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company intends to defend itself in all claims asserted against it, and management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not be material, either individually or in the aggregate, to Webster or its consolidated financial position. Webster establishes an accrual for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings may occur that could cause Webster to adjust its litigation accrual or could have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on its business, financial condition, or operating results.
