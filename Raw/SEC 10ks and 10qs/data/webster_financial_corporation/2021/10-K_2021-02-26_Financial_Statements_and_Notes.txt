To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

Webster Financial Corporation: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Webster Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Assessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans and leases evaluated on a collective basis 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326), as of January 1, 2020. The total allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 was $266.7 million, of which $252.5 million related to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases evaluated on a collective basis (the January 1, 2020 collective ACL). As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s total allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 was $359.4 million, of which $343.3 million related to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases evaluated on a collective basis (the December 31, 2020 collective ACL). The January 1, 2020 collective ACL and the December 31, 2020 collective ACL include the measure of expected credit losses on a collective (pooled) basis for those loans and leases that share similar risk characteristics. The Company&#8217;s collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on the commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using models that follow a probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) framework. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company&#8217;s estimates of PD, LGD, and individual loan level EAD on an undiscounted basis. The Company&#8217;s calculations of PD and LGD use predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, historical loss information, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans. Macroeconomic variables are used as inputs to the PD and LGD models and are selected based on the correlation of the variables to credit losses for each portfolio segment. The Company&#8217;s models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts on a straight-line basis to its historical loss rates, evaluated over the historical observation period, for the remaining life of the loans and leases. The calculation of EAD follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of similar segment within the same portfolio. The calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses and principal paydown (PPD). PPD is the combination of contractual repayment and prepayment. A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics which are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. 

We identified the assessment of the January 1, 2020 collective ACL and the December 31, 2020 collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) the PD, LGD, EAD and their significant assumptions, including portfolio segmentation, the economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the historical observation period, credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and PPD (2) qualitative adjustments and their significant assumptions related to credit concentration, nature and volume of portfolio growth, loan credit quality and economic considerations not reflected in the PD and LGD models and EAD method. Such significant assumptions are sensitive to variation, such that minor changes in the assumption can cause significant changes in the estimates. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD models and EAD method. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company&#8217;s measurement of the collective ACL estimates, including controls over the: 

&#8226; development of the collective ACL methodology 

&#8226; development of the PD and LGD models and EAD method 

&#8226; identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in the PD and LGD models and EAD method 

&#8226; development of the qualitative adjustments for the economic considerations not reflected in the PD and LGD models, including significant assumptions 

&#8226; development of other qualitative adjustments, including the significant assumptions 

&#8226; performance monitoring of the PD and LGD models and EAD method for the December 31, 2020 collective ACL 

&#8226; analysis of the collective ACL results, trends, and ratios. 

We evaluated the Company&#8217;s process to develop the collective ACL estimates by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 

&#8226; evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development and performance testing of the PD and LGD models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 

&#8226; assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD models and EAD method by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use 

&#8226; evaluating the conceptual soundness of the PPD methodology including the underlying data utilized by inspecting the method documentation to determine whether the method is suitable for its intended use 

&#8226; evaluating the economic forecast scenario and underlying assumptions by comparing them to the Company&#8217;s business environment and relevant industry practices 

&#8226; evaluating the length of the historical observation period and reasonable and supportable forecast periods by comparing them to specific portfolio risks characteristics and trends 

&#8226; determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company&#8217;s business environment and relevant industry practices 

&#8226; testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral 

&#8226; evaluating the methodology and assumptions used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ACL compared with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models. 

We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the January 1, 2020 collective ACL and the December 31, 2020 collective ACL by evaluating the: 

&#8226; cumulative results of the audit procedures 

&#8226; qualitative aspects of the Company&#8217;s accounting practices 

&#8226; potential bias in the accounting estimates.

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Operations 

Webster Financial Corporation is a bank holding company and financial holding company under the BHC Act, incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1986 and headquartered in Waterbury, Connecticut. Webster Bank is the principal consolidated subsidiary of Webster Financial Corporation. Webster Bank, including its HSA Bank division, deliver a wide range of banking, investment, and financial services to individuals, families, and businesses. Webster Bank serves consumer and business customers with mortgage lending, financial planning, trust, and investment services through a distribution network consisting of banking centers, ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services throughout southern New England and Westchester County, New York. It also offers equipment financing, commercial real estate lending, asset-based lending, and treasury and payment solutions primarily in the eastern U.S. HSA Bank is a leading provider of health savings accounts, while also delivering health reimbursement arrangements, and flexible spending and commuter benefit account administration services to employers and individuals in all 50 states. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company that materially affect its financial statements conform with GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes thereto include the accounts of Webster Financial Corporation and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Assets that the Company holds or manages in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers, typically referred to as assets under administration or assets under management, are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as those assets are not the Company's, and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had an immaterial effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The purpose of consolidated financial statements is to present the results of operations and the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, the consolidated financial statements include any voting interest entity (VOE) in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and any variable interest entity (VIE) for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company generally consolidates its VOEs if the Company, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the entity and the non-controlling shareholders do not hold any substantive participating or controlling rights. The Company evaluates VIEs to understand the purpose and design of the entity, and its involvement in the ongoing activities of the VIE and will consolidate the VIE if it has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses of the VIE, or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The Company accounts for unconsolidated partnerships and certain other investments using the equity method of accounting if it has the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of the investee. This is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of a corporation, or when it has greater than 3%-5% interest in a limited partnership or similarly structured entity. Refer to Note 2: Variable Interest Entities for further information. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents, as referenced in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, is comprised of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits. Cash equivalents have a maturity of three months or less. 

Cash and due from banks, as referenced in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, includes cash on hand, certain deposits at the FRB of Boston, and cash due from banks. Restricted cash related to Federal Reserve System requirements and cash collateral received on derivative positions are included in cash and due from banks. 

Interest-bearing deposits, as referenced in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, includes deposits at the FRB of Boston in excess of reserve requirements and federal funds sold to other financial institutions. Federal funds sold essentially represents an uncollateralized loan and therefore the Company regularly evaluates the credit risk associated with the other financial institutions to assure that Webster does not become exposed to any significant credit risk on those cash equivalents. 

Investment in Debt Securities 

Debt security transactions are recognized on the trade date, which is the date the order to buy or sell the security is executed. Investment in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. Any classification change subsequent to trade date is reviewed for compliance with corporate objectives and accounting policies. 

Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are those which Webster has the ability and intent to hold to maturity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost net of unamortized premiums and discounts. Discount accretion income and premium amortization expense are recognized as interest income using the effective interest method, with consideration given to prepayment assumptions on mortgage backed securities. Premiums are amortized to the earliest call date for debt securities purchased at a premium, with explicit, non-contingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset date. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are reviewed for credit losses under the CECL model with an allowance recorded on the balance sheet for expected lifetime credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is calculated on a pooled basis using statistical models which include forecasted scenarios of future economic conditions. Forecasts revert to long-run loss rates implicitly through the economic scenario, generally over three years. If the risk for a particular security no longer matches the collective assessment pool, it is removed and individually assessed for credit deterioration. A security will be placed on non-accrual status if collection of principal and interest in accordance with contractual terms is doubtful. 

Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) or other comprehensive loss (OCL). If a debt security is transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity it is recorded at fair value at the time of transfer and the respective gain or loss would be recorded as a separate component of OCI or OCL and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of such security. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reviewed for credit losses when the fair value of a security falls below the amortized cost basis and the decline is evaluated to determine if any portion is attributable to credit loss. The decline in fair value attributable to credit loss is recorded directly to earnings, with a corresponding allowance for credit loss, limited to the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost. If the credit quality subsequently improves, previously recorded allowance amounts may be reversed. The non-accrual policy for available-for-sale debt securities is the same as for held-to-maturity debt securities. When the Company intends to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security, prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire fair value adjustment will immediately be recognized in earnings through non-interest income. The gain or loss on sale is calculated using the carrying value plus any related accumulated OCI or OCL balance associated with the securities sold. 

A zero credit loss assumption is maintained for U.S. Treasuries and agency-backed securities in both the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale portfolios. This assumption is subject to quarterly review to ensure it remains appropriate. Refer to Note 4: Investment Securities for further information related to investment in debt securities. 

Investment in Equity Securities 

The Company&#8217;s accounting treatment for unconsolidated equity investments differs for those with and without readily determinable fair values. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company elected the measurement alternative, and therefore carries these investments at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in observable prices. Certain equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for net asset value (NAV) measurement based on specific requirements. The Company's alternative investments accounted for at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investments are distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews its equity investments without readily determinable fair values for impairment. If the equity investment is considered impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value is recorded through a charge to earnings. The impairment loss may be reversed in a subsequent period if there are observable transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer at a higher amount than the carrying amount that was established when the impairment was recognized. Impairment as well as upward or downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments are included in non-interest income. 

Equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock 

Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve System, and is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the FHLB of Boston and FRB of Boston. Based on redemption provisions, the stock of both the FHLB and the FRB has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Membership stock is reviewed for impairment if economic circumstances would warrant review. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans that are classified as held for sale at the time of origination are accounted for under the fair value option. Loans not originated for sale but subsequently transferred to held for sale are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and are valued on an individual asset basis. Any cost amount in excess of fair value is recorded as a valuation allowance and recognized as a reduction of other non-interest income. Gains or losses on the sale of loans held for sale are recorded as part of mortgage banking activities, or other income. Cash flows from the sale of loans that were originated specifically for resale are presented as operating cash flows. Cash flows from the sale of loans originated for investment then subsequently transferred to held for sale are presented as investing cash flows. Refer to Note 6: Transfers of Financial Assets for further information. 

Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets 

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is generally considered to have been surrendered when: (i) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; (ii) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a trivial benefit to the Company; and (iii) the Company does not maintain the obligation or unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets. 

The Company sells financial assets in the normal course of business, the majority of which are residential mortgage loan sales, primarily to government-sponsored enterprises through established programs, commercial loan sales through participation agreements, and other individual or portfolio loan and securities sales. In accordance with accounting guidance for asset transfers, the Company considers any ongoing involvement with transferred assets in determining whether the assets can be derecognized from the balance sheet. With the exception of servicing the Company&#8217;s continuing involvement with financial assets sold is minimal and generally limited to market customary representation and warranty clauses covering certain characteristics of the mortgage loans sold and the Company's origination process. The gain or loss on sale depends on the previous carrying amount of the transferred financial assets, the consideration received, and any other assets obtained or liabilities incurred in exchange for the transferred assets. 

When the Company sells financial assets, it may retain servicing rights and/or other interests in the financial assets. Servicing assets and any other interests held by the Company are recorded at fair value upon transfer, and thereafter are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Refer to Note 6: Transfers of Financial Assets for further information. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of amounts charged off, unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and deferred loan and lease fees or costs which are recognized as yield adjustments using the interest method. These yield adjustments are amortized over the contractual life of the related loans and leases adjusted for prepayments when applicable. Interest on loans and leases is credited to interest income as earned based on the interest rate applied to principal amounts outstanding. Prepayment fees are recognized in non-interest income. Cash flows from loans and leases are presented as investing cash flows. 

Non-accrual Loans 

Loans and leases are placed on non-accrual status when collection of principal and interest in accordance with contractual terms is doubtful, generally when principal or interest payments become 90 days delinquent, unless the loan or lease is well secured and in process of collection, or sooner if management concludes circumstances indicate that the borrower may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest payments. Residential real estate loans, excluding loans fully insured against loss and in the process of collection, and consumer loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, or at the date when the Company is notified that the borrower is discharged in bankruptcy. Residential loans that are more than 90 days past due, fully insured against loss, and in the process of collection, remain accruing and are reported as 90 days or more past due and accruing. Commercial, commercial real estate loans, and equipment finance loans or leases are subject to a detailed review when 90 days past due to determine accrual status, or when payment is uncertain and a specific consideration is made to put a loan or lease on non-accrual status. 

When loans and leases are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued, and any unpaid accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income. If ultimate repayment of a non-accrual loan or lease is expected, any payments received are applied in accordance with contractual terms. If ultimate repayment is not expected on commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment finance loans and leases, any payment received on a non-accrual loan or lease is applied to principal until the unpaid balance has been fully recovered. Any excess is then credited to interest income when received. If the Company determines, through a current valuation analysis, that principal can be recovered on residential real estate and consumer loans, interest payments are taken into income as received on a cash basis. 

Loans are generally removed from non-accrual status when they become current as to principal and interest or demonstrate a period of performance under contractual terms and, in the opinion of management, are fully collectible as to principal and interest. Pursuant to regulatory guidance, a loan discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code is removed from non-accrual status when the bank expects full repayment of the remaining pre-discharged contractual principal and interest, and had at least six consecutive months of current payments. Refer to Note 5: Loans and Leases for further information. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The ACL on loans and leases is a contra-asset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses expected to occur over the life of the asset. The ACL is established through a provision charged to expense. Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the reserve which is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios. The Company has elected to present accrued interest receivable separately from the amortized cost basis on the balance sheet and does not estimate an ACL on accrued interest as policies are in place to ensure timely write-offs and non-accruals. 

The ACL on loans and leases is determined using the CECL model which requires recognition of expected lifetime credit losses at the origination or purchase of an asset. Expected losses are determined through pooled, collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics. If the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change and no longer match the collective assessment pool, it is removed and individually assessed for credit impairment. Management applies significant judgments and assumptions that influence the loss estimate and ACL on loan and lease balances. 

Collectively Assessed Loans and Leases. Collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on two portfolio segments, the commercial loans and leases and consumer loans. Expected losses are determined using a Probability of Default/Loss Given Default/Exposure at Default (PD/LGD/EAD) framework. Expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting, expected loss given the occurrence of a default, and the projected exposure of a loan at default. Summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio. The Company&#8217;s PD and LGD calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, historical loss information, and credit risk ratings. 

The Company employs a dual grade credit risk grading system for estimating the PD and the LGD for commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing borrowers. The credit risk grade system assigns a rating to each borrower and to the facility, which together form a Composite Credit Risk Profile. The credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics. The Composite Credit Risk Profile has ten grades, with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss. Grades (1) - (6) are considered pass ratings, and (7) - (10) are considered criticized as defined by the regulatory agencies. Risk ratings, assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio, are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrowers&#8217; current financial position and outlook, risk profile, and the related collateral and structural position. Loan officers review updated financial information or other loan factors on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade. Criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring. A (7) "Special Mention" asset has the potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset. A (8) "Substandard" asset has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt. An asset rated (9) "Doubtful" has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard credit with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, given current facts, conditions, and values, improbable. Assets classified as (10) "Loss" in accordance with regulatory guidelines are considered uncollectible and charged off. 

For residential and consumer loans, the Company considers factors such as past due status, updated FICO scores, employment status, collateral, geography, loans discharged in bankruptcy, and the status of first lien position loans on second lien position loans as credit quality indicators. On an ongoing basis for portfolio monitoring purposes, the Company estimates the current value of property secured as collateral for home equity and residential first mortgage lending products. The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by the S&#38;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. The real estate price data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The Company&#8217;s models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts on a straight-line basis to its historical loss rates, evaluated over the historical observation period, for the remaining life of the loans and leases. The calculation of exposure at default follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of similar segment within the same portfolio. The calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses and principal paydown (PPD). PPD is the combination of contractual repayment and prepayment. A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics which are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. 

Macroeconomic variables are used as inputs to the loss models and are selected based on the correlation of the variables to credit losses for each class of financing receivable as follows: the commercial model uses unemployment, GDP, and retail sales (for commercial unfunded); the residential model uses the Case-Shiller Home Price Index; home equity loan and line of credit models use interest rate spreads between U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds and the home equity loan model also uses the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) home price index; personal loan and credit line models use the Case-Shiller and FHFA home price indices. There were no changes to the macroeconomic variables used in the loss models in the current year. Forecasted economic scenarios are sourced from a third party. Data from the baseline forecast scenario is used as the input to the modeled loss calculation. Changes in forecasts of macroeconomic variables will impact expectations of lifetime credit losses calculated by the loss models. However, the impact of changes in macroeconomic forecasts may be different for each portfolio and will reflect the credit quality and nature of the underlying assets at that time. 

To further refine the expected loss estimate qualitative factors are used reflecting consideration of: credit concentration, credit quality trends, the quality of internal loan reviews, the nature and volume of portfolio growth, staffing levels, underwriting exceptions, and economic considerations not reflected in the base loss model. Management may apply additional qualitative adjustments to reflect other relevant facts and circumstances that impact expected credit losses. These economic and qualitative inputs are used to forecast expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company uses a 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, after which, loss rates revert to historical loss rates on a straight-line basis over a 1-year period. Historical loss rates are based on approximately 10 years of recently available data and are updated annually. 

In addition to the above considerations, the ACL calculation includes expectations of prepayments and recoveries. Extensions, renewals, and modifications are not included in the collective assessment; however, if there is a reasonable expectation of a TDR, the loan is removed from the collective assessment pool and is individually assessed. 

Individually Assessed Loans and Leases. When loans and leases no longer match the risk characteristics of the collective assessment pool, they are removed from the collectively assessed population and individually assessed for credit losses. Generally, all non-accrual loans, TDRs, potential TDRs, loans with a charge-off, and collateral dependent loans when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, are individually assessed. 

Individual assessment for collateral dependent commercial loans facing financial difficulty is based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell, or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral, or a scenario weighted approach of both of these methods. If a loan is not collateral dependent, the individual assessment is based on a discounted cash flow approach. For collateral dependent commercial loans and leases, Webster's impairment process requires the Company to determine the fair value of the collateral by obtaining a third-party appraisal or asset valuation, an interim valuation analysis, blue book reference, or other internal methods. Fair value of the collateral for commercial loans is reevaluated quarterly. Whenever the Company has a third-party real estate appraisal performed by independent licensed appraisers, a licensed in-house appraisal officer or qualified individual reviews these appraisals for compliance with the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. 

Individual assessments for residential and home equity loans are based on a discounted cash flow approach or the fair value of collateral less the estimated costs to sell. Other consumer loans are individually assessed using a loss factor approach based on historical loss rates. For residential and consumer collateral dependent loans, a third-party appraisal is obtained upon loan default. Fair value of the collateral for residential and consumer collateral dependent loans is reevaluated every six months, by either obtaining a new appraisal or other internal valuation method. Fair value is also reassessed, with any excess amount charged off, for residential and home equity loans that reach 180 days past due per Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines. 

A fair value shortfall relative to the amortized cost balance is reflected as an impairment reserve within the ACL on loans and leases. Subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate, should reliable information come to management's attention that the value has declined further, additional impairment may be recorded to reflect the particular situation, thereby increasing the ACL on loans and leases. If the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance is reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses. Any individually assessed loan for which no specific valuation allowance is necessary is the result of either sufficient cash flow or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost. 

Before the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) was determined under the ALLL incurred loss model which reflected management&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing loan and lease portfolio as of the related balance sheet date. The ALLL consists of three elements: (i) specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on impaired loans and leases; (ii) quantitative valuation allowances calculated using loss experience for like loans and leases with similar characteristics and trends, adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the impact of current conditions; and (iii) qualitative factors determined based on general economic conditions and other factors that may be internal or external to the Company. The reserve level reflects management&#8217;s view of trends in losses, portfolio quality, and economic, political, and regulatory conditions. While management utilized its best judgment based on the information available at the time, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, which include the performance its portfolio, economic conditions, interest rate sensitivity, and other external factors. 

The process for estimating probable losses under the ALLL approach is based on predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan and lease portfolio and combines the measurement with other quantitative and qualitative factors. To measure credit risk for the commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing portfolios, the Company employs a dual grade credit risk grading system for estimating the PD and the LGD. The credit risk grade system under the ALLL model is the same as described under the CECL approach. For residential and consumer loans, the Company's credit risk factors are also consistent with the factors used in the CECL approach. Back-testing was performed to compare original estimated losses and actual observed losses, resulting in ongoing refinements. The balance resulting from this process together with specific valuation allowances determines the overall reserve level. 

Refer to Note 5: Loans and Leases for further information. 

Charge-off of Uncollectible Loans 

Any loan may be charged-off if a loss confirming event has occurred or if there is a period of extended delinquency. Loss confirming events usually involve the receipt of specific adverse information about the borrower and may include bankruptcy when unsecured, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a shortfall between the value of the collateral and the book value of the loan when that collateral asset is the sole source of repayment. The Company generally will charge-off commercial loans when it is determined that the specific loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible. This determination is based on facts and circumstances of the individual loan and normally includes considering the viability of the related business, the value of any collateral, the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform and the overall financial condition of the borrower. The Company generally will charge-off residential real estate loans to the estimated fair value of its collateral, net of selling costs, when becoming 180 days past due. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments provides for potential exposure inherent with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. Accounting for unfunded loan commitments follows the CECL model. The calculation of the allowance includes the probability of funding to occur and a corresponding estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on amounts assumed to be funded. Loss calculation factors are consistent with the ACL methodology for funded loans using PD and LGD applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades, a draw down factor applied to utilization rates, relevant forecast information, and management's qualitative factors. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded credit commitments is included within other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related credit expense is reported as a component of other non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 23: Commitments and Contingencies for further information. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A modified loan is considered a TDR when the following two conditions are met: (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty; and (ii) the modification constitutes a concession. The Company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted, including the borrower's ability to access funds at a market rate. In general, a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms. Modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower. The most common types of modifications include covenant modifications and forbearance. Loans for which the borrower has been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent TDR, impaired at the date of discharge, and charged down to the fair value of collateral less cost to sell, if management considers that loss potential likely exists. 

The Company&#8217;s policy is to place consumer loan TDRs, except those that were performing prior to TDR status, on non-accrual status for a minimum period of six months. Commercial TDR are evaluated on a case-by-case basis for determination of whether or not to place them on non-accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Initially, all TDRs are reported as impaired. Generally, TDRs are classified as impaired loans and reported as TDR for the remaining life of the loan. Impaired and TDR classification may be removed if the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum of six months and through a fiscal year-end and the restructuring agreement specifies a market rate of interest equal to that which would be provided to a borrower with similar credit at the time of restructuring. In the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from TDR classification, it is the Company&#8217;s policy to continue to base its measure of loan impairment on the contractual terms specified by the loan agreement. Refer to Note 5: Loans and Leases for further information. 

Foreclosed and Repossessed Assets 

Real estate acquired through foreclosure or completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and other assets acquired through repossession are recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of transfer. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the foreclosed and repossessed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and are included within other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Independent appraisals generally are obtained to substantiate fair value and may be subject to adjustment based upon historical experience or specific geographic trends impacting the property. Upon transfer to other real estate owned (OREO) the excess of loan balance over fair value less cost to sell is charged off against the ACL. Subsequent write-downs in value, maintenance costs as incurred, and gains or losses upon sale are charged to non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: 

##TABLE_START Minimum Maximum Building and Improvements 5 - 40 years Leasehold improvements 5 - 20 years (or lease term, if shorter) Fixtures and equipment 5 - 10 years Data processing and software 3 - 7 years ##TABLE_END

Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to non-interest expense as incurred. Property and equipment that is actively marketed for sale is reclassified to assets held for disposition. The cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization relating to property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated, and any resulting losses are charged to non-interest expense. Refer to Note 7: Premises and Equipment for further information. 

Leasing 

A ROU asset and corresponding lease liability is recognized at the lease commencement date when the Company is a lessee. ROU lease assets are included in premises and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. A ROU asset reflects the present value of the future minimum lease payments adjusted for any initial direct costs, incentives, or other payments prior to the lease commencement date. A lease liability represents a legal obligation to make lease payments and is determined by the present value of the future minimum lease payments discounted using the rate implicit in the lease, or the Company&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index, or rate, are initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date and are included in the measurement of the lease liability. Renewal options are not included as part of the ROU asset or lease liability unless the option is deemed reasonably certain to exercise. 

For real estate leases, lease components and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component. For equipment leases, lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Operating lease expense is comprised of operating lease costs and variable lease costs, net of sublease income, and is reflected as part of occupancy within non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. Refer to Note 8: Leasing for further information. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is assigned to specific reporting units. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but rather is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating it would more likely than not result in a reduction of the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying value, including goodwill. 

Goodwill may be evaluated for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or if for any other reason the Company determines to be appropriate, then a quantitative assessment will be performed. The quantitative assessment process utilizes an equally weighted combined income and market approach to arrive at an indicated fair value range for the reporting units. The fair value calculated for each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to ascertain if goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, including goodwill for a reporting unit it is not considered impaired. If the fair value is below the carrying amount, including goodwill for a reporting unit then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the calculated fair value, up to but not exceeding the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The resulting amount is charged to non-interest expense. 

The Company completed a quantitative assessment for its reporting units during its most recent annual impairment review. Based on this quantitative assessment, the Company determined that there was no evidence of impairment to the balance of its goodwill. Refer to Note 9: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 

Other Intangible Assets 

Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights, or because it is capable of being sold or exchanged either separately or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives, such as core deposits and customer relationships, are amortized to non-interest expense over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances change indicating the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 9: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance 

Investment in life insurance represents the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain current and former employees of Webster. Cash surrender value increases are recorded in non-interest income, decreases are the result of collection on the policies, with death benefit proceeds in excess of cash surrender value recorded in other non-interest income upon the death of an insured. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 

These agreements are accounted for as secured financing transactions since Webster maintains effective control over the transferred investment securities and the transfer meets the other criteria for such accounting. Obligations to repurchase the sold investment securities are reflected as a liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investment securities sold, with agreement to repurchase, to wholesale dealers are transferred to a custodial account for the benefit of the dealer or bank with whom each transaction is executed. The dealers or banks may sell, loan, or otherwise hypothecate such securities to other parties in the normal course of their operations and agree to resell to Webster the same securities at the maturity date of the agreements. Webster also enters into repurchase agreements with Bank customers. The investment securities sold with agreement to repurchase to Bank customers are not transferred but internally pledged to the repurchase agreement transaction. Refer to Note 12: Borrowings for further information. 

Revenue From Contracts With Customers 

Revenue from contracts with customers generally comprises non-interest income earned by the Company in exchange for services provided to customers and is recognized when services are complete or as they are rendered. These revenue streams include deposit service fees, wealth and investment services, and an insignificant component of other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company identifies the performance obligations included in the contracts with customers, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations, as applicable, and recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. Services provided over a period of time are typically transferred to customers evenly over the term of the contracts and revenue is recognized evenly over the period services are provided. Contract receivables are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets. Payment terms vary by services offered, and the time between completion of performance obligations and payment is typically not significant. Refer to Note 22: Revenue from Contracts with Customers for further information. 

Share-Based Compensation 

Webster maintains stock compensation plans under which restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and directors. Share awards are issued from available treasury shares. Share-based compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period, is based on the grant-date fair value, net of a reduction for estimated forfeitures which is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur, and is reported as a component of compensation and benefits within non-interest expense. Awards are generally subject to a 3-year vesting period, while certain conditions provide for a 1-year vesting period. For restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, fair value is measured using the Company's common stock closing price at the date of grant. For certain performance-based restricted stock awards, fair value is measured using the Monte Carlo valuation methodology, which provides for the 3-year performance period. Awards ultimately vest in a range from zero to 150 % of the target number of shares under the grant. Compensation expense is subject to adjustment based on management's assessment of Webster's return on equity performance relative to the target number of shares condition. Stock option awards use the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model to measure fair value at the date of grant. Excess tax benefit or tax deficiency results when tax return deductions differ from recognized compensation cost determined using the grant-date fair value approach for financial statement purposes. 

Dividends are paid on time-based shares upon grant and are non-forfeitable, while dividends are accrued on performance-based awards and paid with the vested shares when the performance target is met. Refer to Note 20: Share-Based Plans for further information. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense, or benefit, is comprised of two components, current and deferred. The current component reflects taxes payable or refundable for a current period based on applicable tax laws, and the deferred component represents the tax effects of temporary differences between amounts recognized for financial accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effects of such differences that are anticipated to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future, when the temporary differences reverse. DTAs are recognized if it is more likely than not they will be realized, and may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion will not be realized. 

Tax positions that are uncertain but meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management's judgment. Webster recognizes interest expense and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense and recognizes interest income on refundable income taxes as a component of other non-interest income. Refer to Note 10: Income Taxes for further information. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Earnings per common share is calculated under the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding outstanding participating securities, during the pertinent period. Certain unvested restricted stock awards are participating securities as they have non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares determined for the basic earnings per common share computation plus the dilutive effect of shares resulting from stock compensation and warrants for common stock, using the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of the weighted-average shares used in calculating basic earnings per common share and the weighted-average common shares used in calculating diluted earnings per common share is provided in Note 16: Earnings Per Common Share. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income includes all changes in shareholders&#8217; equity during a period, except those resulting from transactions with shareholders. Comprehensive income consists of net income, and the after-tax effect of the following items: changes in net unrealized gain/loss on securities available for sale, changes in net unrealized gain/loss on derivative instruments, and changes in net actuarial gain/loss for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Comprehensive income is reported in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and detailed in Note 14: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

Derivatives are recognized at fair value and included in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of exchange-traded contracts is based on quoted market prices while non-exchange traded contracts are valued based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require management judgment or estimation, relating to future rates and credit activities. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships. The Company uses derivatives to hedge exposures, or to modify interest rate characteristics, for certain balance sheet accounts under its interest rate risk management strategy. The Company designates derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Derivative financial instruments receive hedge accounting treatment if they are qualified and properly designated as a hedge and remain highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the hedge. Quarterly prospective and retrospective assessments are performed to ensure hedging relationships continue to be highly effective. If a hedge relationship were no longer highly effective, hedge accounting would be discontinued. 

The change in fair value on a derivative designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged, is recognized in earnings in the same accounting period. The gain or loss on a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax (AOCL) and subsequently reclassified to interest income as hedged interest payments are received or to interest expense as hedged interest payments are made in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships . The Company also enters into derivative transactions which are not designated in hedge relationships. Derivative financial instruments not designated in hedge relationships are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . The Company presents derivative assets and derivative liabilities with the same counterparty and the related variation margin of cash collateral on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral relating to initial margin is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Securities collateral is not offset. The Company clears all dealer eligible contracts through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and has elected to record non-cleared derivative positions subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement on a net basis. 

Refer to Note 17: Derivative Financial Instruments for further information. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company measures many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, " Fair Value Measurement. " Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Examples of these include derivative instruments, available-for-sale securities, and loans held for sale where the Company has elected the fair value option. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment. Examples of these include impaired loans and leases, mortgage servicing assets, long-lived assets, goodwill, and loans not originated for sale but subsequently transferred to held for sale, which are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. Further information regarding the Company's policies and methodology used to measure fair value is presented in Note 18: Fair Value Measurements. 

Employee Retirement Benefit Plans 

Webster Bank maintains a defined-contribution plan offering traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k) options that are available to employees aged 21 and above, beginning 90 days after hire. All expenses of maintaining this qualified plan, as well as matching contributions, are charged to other expense within non-interest expense. 

Webster Bank maintains a noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan covering all employees that were participants on or before December 31, 2007. Costs related to this qualified plan, based upon actuarial computations of current and future benefits for eligible employees, are charged to other expense within non-interest expense and are funded in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The plan is recorded as an asset when over-funded or a liability when under-funded. 

There is a supplemental retirement plan for select executive level employees that were participants on or before December 31, 2007. There is also a postretirement healthcare benefits plan for certain retired employees. Refer to Note 19: Retirement Benefit Plans for further information about these plans. 

Loan Modifications Under the CARES Act and Interagency Statement 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) Section 4013, and the Revised Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus. 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act, which provides relief from certain requirements under GAAP, was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act gives entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) under ASC 310-40 in certain situations. 

In addition, on April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement that offers practical expedients for evaluating whether loan modifications in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are TDRs. The interagency statement was originally issued on March 22, 2020, but was revised to address the relationship between their original TDR guidance and the guidance in Section 4013 of the CARES Act. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the relief offered by the CARES Act related to TDRs. 

To qualify for TDR accounting and disclosure relief under the CARES Act, the applicable loan must not have been more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and the modification must be executed between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, subsequently extended through January 1, 2022, or the date that is 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020, under the National Emergencies Act related to the outbreak of COVID-19. The CARES Act applies to modifications made as a result of COVID-19 including: forbearance agreements, interest rate modifications, repayment plans, and other arrangements to defer or delay payment of principal or interest. 

The interagency statement does not require the modification to be completed within a certain time period if it is related to COVID-19 and the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of the date of the Company&#8217;s implementation of its modification programs. Moreover, the interagency statement applies to short-term modifications including payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other insignificant payment delays as a result of COVID-19. 

The Company continues to apply section 4013 of the CARES Act and the interagency statement in connection with applicable modifications. For modifications that qualify under either the CARES Act or the interagency statement, TDR accounting and reporting is suspended through the period of the modification; however, the Company will continue to apply its existing non-accrual policies including consideration of the loan's past due status which is determined on the basis of the contractual terms of the loan. Once a loan has been contractually modified, the past due status is generally based on the updated terms including payment deferrals. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates 

Effective January 1, 2020, the following new accounting guidance was adopted by the Company: 

ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. 

The Accounting Standards Update (the Update) provides optional expedients and exceptions available to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition to expedients for contract modifications, the Update allows for a one-time transfer or sale of held-to-maturity securities that reference an eligible rate. The Company will consider this one-time securities transfer along with other expedients available under the Update as the Company proceeds with reference rate reform activities. 

The Update became effective during the first quarter 2020, and applies to contract modifications and amendments made as of the beginning of the reporting period including the Update issuance date, March 12, 2020, and applies through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. 

The Update amends guidance on credit losses, hedge accounting, and recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The changes provide clarifications and codification improvements in relation to recently issued accounting updates. The amendments to the guidance on credit losses are considered in the paragraphs below related to our adoption of ASU 2016-13, and has been adopted concurrently with those Updates. 

The Company adopted the Update during the first quarter 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. 

The &#160; Update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The updated guidance also requires an entity to amortize the capitalized implementation costs as an expense over the term of the hosting arrangement presented in the same income statement line item as the fees associated with the hosting arrangement. 

The Company adopted the Update during the first quarter 2020 on a prospective basis to implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. 

The Update modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The updated guidance no longer requires entities to disclose the amount and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, it requires public companies to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income (OCI) for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 measurements. 

The Company adopted the Update during the first quarter 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. 

The Update simplifies quantitative goodwill impairment testing by requiring entities to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, up to but not exceeding the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

The Update changes current guidance by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination upon acquisition. Entities still have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. 

The Company adopted the Update during the first quarter 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and subsequent ASUs issued to clarify this Topic. 

The Updates replace the existing incurred loss approach for recognizing credit losses with a new credit loss methodology known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The CECL methodology requires earlier recognition of credit losses using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach for financial assets carried at amortized cost. The Updates also revised the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, by eliminating the other-than-temporary impairment model and requiring credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than a direct write-down, although determined outside the scope of the CECL methodology. 

The CECL accounting model applies to assets measured at amortized cost including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and off-balance sheet credit exposures. CECL requires recognition of credit losses at purchase or origination using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach. The allowance for credit losses is based on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as of the reporting date and includes consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at that date. The CECL methodology also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine the allowance for credit losses including economic forecasts. 

The "Investment in Debt Securities," "Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases," and "Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments" sections of this note provide detailed information relating to accounting policy reflective of adoption of the Updates. 

Impact of Adoption . The Company adopted the Updates during the first quarter 2020, using the modified retrospective method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an increase in its allowance for credit losses as a cumulative effect adjustment. This adjustment, net of tax, reduced the Company's beginning total shareholders' equity at January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the Company's allowance for credit losses reflected all credit losses expected over the lifetime of the Company's financial assets held at amortized cost. Periods prior to January 1, 2020, are reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. 

The impact of the January 1, 2020, adoption entry is summarized in the table below:

(1) The total allowance for credit losses on loans and leases as of January 1, 2020 consists of $ 252.5 million assessed on a collective basis and $ 14.2 million assessed on an individual basis. 

The Company has elected to defer the CECL impact on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. For additional information on accounting for credit losses refer to Note 4: Investment Securities, Note 5: Loans and Leases, and Note 23: Commitments and Contingencies. 

ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plan - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. 

The Update modifies disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, including eliminating certain disclosure requirements determined to be not useful to users of the financial statements. 

The Company adopted the Update for December 31, 2020 disclosures. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Issued but not yet Adopted 

The following new accounting guidance, applicable to the Company, has been issued by the FASB but is pending adoption: 

ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. 

The Update provides simplifications to the accounting for income taxes related to a variety of topics and makes minor codification improvements. Changes include a requirement that the effects of an enacted change in tax law be reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the new legislation and clarification on presentation of non-income based taxes. 

The Update will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2021. The Company does not expect this Update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2: Variable Interest Entities 

The Company has an investment interest in the following entities that meet the definition of a VIE. 

Consolidated 

Rabbi Trust. The Company established a Rabbi Trust to meet the obligations due under its Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned plan. The funding of the Rabbi Trust and the discontinuation of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers occurred during 2012. 

Investments held in the Rabbi Trust primarily consist of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the Rabbi Trust as it has the power to direct the activities of the Rabbi Trust that significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The Company consolidates the invested assets of the trust along with the total deferred compensation obligations and includes them in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Earnings in the Rabbi Trust, including appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as other non-interest income, and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as compensation and benefits, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 18: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 

Non-Consolidated 

Tax Credit Finance Investments. The Company makes non-marketable equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects and provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits. In most instances, the investments require the funding of capital commitments in the future. While the Company's investment in an entity may exceed 50% of its outstanding equity interests, the entity is not consolidated as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs and the Company does not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's tax credit finance investments was $ 37.2 million and $ 42.5 million, respectively, which represents the Company's maximum exposure to loss. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, unfunded commitments have been recognized, totaling $ 10.2 million and $ 15.1 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Webster Statutory Trust. The Company owns all the outstanding common stock of Webster Statutory Trust, a financial vehicle that has issued, and in the future may issue, trust preferred securities. The trust is a VIE in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The trust's only assets are junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company, which were acquired by the trust using the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common stock. The junior subordinated 

debentures are included in long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related interest expense is reported as interest expense on long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Other Non-Marketable Investments. The Company invests in various alternative investments in which it holds a variable interest. These investments are non-public entities which cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. For these investments, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. 

At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's other non-marketable investments in VIEs was $ 34.3 million and $ 21.8 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss of the Company's other non-marketable investments in VIEs, including unfunded commitments, was $ 72.7 million and $ 64.2 million, respectively. Refer to Note 18: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 

The Company's equity interests in Other Non-Marketable Investments, as well as Tax Credit-Finance Investments and Webster Statutory Trust, are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For a description of the Company's accounting policy regarding the consolidation of VIEs, refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the section &#8220;Principles of Consolidation.&#8221; 

Note 3: Business Developments 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company began implementing certain cost saving measures as part of its previously announced strategic initiatives. These actions include a plan to consolidate 26 banking centers into other nearby banking centers within its network and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021; as well as plans to simplify the organization which will result in reductions across various corporate, support, and other functions. 

The following table presents the changes in accrued expenses associated with strategic initiatives for the year ended December 31, 2020: 

##TABLE_START (In thousands) Severance ROU Asset Other Total Beginning balance $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Charged to earnings 17,860 &#160; 13,000 &#160; 11,797 &#160; 42,657 &#160; Charges against assets &#8212; &#160; ( 13,000 ) ( 1,009 ) ( 14,009 ) Cash payments ( 185 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 8,668 ) ( 8,853 ) Ending balance $ 17,675 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2,120 &#160; $ 19,795 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Reserves for strategic initiatives are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Severance cost are recorded as compensation and benefits, ROU asset charges are recorded as occupancy expense, and other is recorded as either occupancy, technology and equipment, professional and outside services, or other expense, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. These expenses are recorded in the corporate and reconciling category in the segment reporting presentation.

(1) Amortized cost excludes accrued interest receivable of $ 22.1 million and $ 21.8 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which is included in accrued interest and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

(2) The Company adopted the new accounting standard for credit losses on January 1, 2020. For periods subsequent to adoption, the allowance is calculated under the CECL methodology and the resulting provision includes expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. The prior period did not have an allowance under applicable GAAP for that period. 

Agency securities represent obligations issued by a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or other federally-related entity and are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed and therefore, assumed to be zero loss. Securities with unrealized losses and no allowance are considered to be of high credit quality, and therefore, no credit loss as of December 31, 2020. The current unrealized loss position of certain agency securities with no credit loss allowance can be attributed to the changing interest rate environment. An allowance for credit losses on investment securities held-to-maturity of $ 397 thousand was recorded for certain Municipal bonds and notes to account for expected lifetime credit loss upon adoption of the new accounting standard for credit losses. Expected lifetime credit loss on investment securities held-to-maturity is primarily attributed to securities not rated. 

The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses on investment securities held-to-maturity:

Credit Quality Information 

The Company monitors the credit quality of held-to-maturity debt securities through credit ratings by Standard &#38; Poor's Rating Services (S&#38;P), Moody's Investor Services (Moody's), Fitch Ratings, Inc., Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or DBRS Inc. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security. Investment grade securities are rated BBB- or higher by S&#38;P, or Baa3 or higher by Moody's, and generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be of low credit risk. Conversely, securities rated below investment grade, labeled as speculative grade by the rating agencies, are considered to have distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade securities. Securities shown below that are not rated are collateralized with U.S. Treasury obligations, and credit quality indicators are updated at each quarter end. 

The following table summarizes credit ratings for amortized cost of held-to-maturity debt securities according to their lowest public credit rating as of December 31, 2020:

Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities presented in the previous table have not been recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income because the securities are high credit quality, investment grade securities that the Company does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is primarily attributable to wider spreads in selected asset classes. Fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity. As of December 31, 2020, none of the available-for-sale investment securities were in non-accrual status.

(1) Loan balances include net deferred (fees)/costs and net (premiums)/discounts of $( 10.5 ) million and $ 17.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in net balance is driven by deferred fees on PPP loans. 

(2) At December 31, 2020, the Company had pledged $ 7.7 billion of eligible loans as collateral to support borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Boston and the FRB of Boston. 

(3) Loan balances exclude accrued interest receivable of $ 57.8 million and $ 59.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Equipment financing includes net investment in leases of $ 236.1 million and $ 169.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total undiscounted cash flows, primarily due within the next five years, amounted to $ 256.3 million at December 31, 2020. This lessor activity resulted in interest income of $ 7.1 million and $ 5.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The increase in ACL at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, is primarily attributable to the initial adoption of the CECL lifetime loss accounting model and the impact of current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions on credit models, which were negatively affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 

Credit Quality Indicators. To measure credit risk for the commercial portfolio, the Company employs a dual grade credit risk grading system for estimating the PD and LGD. This credit risk grading system has not changed with the adoption of CECL. The credit risk grade system assigns a rating to each borrower and to the facility, which together form a Composite Credit Risk Profile. The credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics. The Composite Credit Risk Profile has ten grades, with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss. Grades (1) to (6) are considered pass ratings and (7) to (10) are considered criticized, as defined by the regulatory agencies. Risk ratings, assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio, are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrowers&#8217; current financial position and outlook, risk profile, and the related collateral and structural position. Loan officers review updated financial information on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade. Criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring. A (7)-"Special Mention" rating has a potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit. A (8)-"Substandard" rating has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt. A (9)-"Doubtful" rating has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard credit with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, given current facts, conditions, and values, improbable. Credits when classified as (10)-"Loss," in accordance with regulatory guidelines, are considered uncollectible and charged off. 

To measure credit risk for the consumer portfolio, the most relevant credit characteristic is the FICO score, which is a widely used credit scoring system that ranges from 300 to 850. A lower FICO score is indicative of higher credit risk. FICO scores are updated at least quarterly. 

The following table summarizes commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing loans and leases segregated by origination year and risk rating exposure under the Composite Credit Risk Profile grades as of December 31, 2020:

Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is substantially expected through the operation or sale of collateral. A collateral dependent loan is individually assessed based on the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, as of the reporting date. Commercial non-mortgage, asset based, and equipment financing are collateralized by equipment, inventory, receivables, or other non-real estate assets. Commercial real estate, residential, and home equity are collateralized by real estate. Collateral value on collateral dependent loans and leases was $ 150.3 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 109.8 million at December 31, 2019. 

The following table summarizes whether, or not, individually assessed loans and leases are collateral dependent:

Note 6: Transfers of Financial Assets 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

The Company sells financial assets in the normal course of business, primarily residential mortgage loans sold to government-sponsored enterprises through established programs and securitization. Residential mortgage origination fees, adjustments for changes in fair value, and gain or loss on loans sold are included as mortgage banking activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Company may be required to repurchase a loan in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties, or in the event of default of the borrower within 90 days of sale, as provided for in the sale agreements. A reserve for loan repurchases provides for estimated losses pertaining to the potential repurchase of loans associated with the Company's mortgage banking activities. The reserve reflects loan repurchase requests received by the Company for which management evaluates the identity of counterparty, the vintage of the loans sold, the amount of open repurchase requests, specific loss estimates for each open request, the current level of loan losses in similar vintages held in the residential loan portfolio, and estimated recoveries on the underlying collateral. The reserve also reflects management&#8217;s expectation of losses from loan repurchase requests for which the Company has not yet been notified. The provision recorded at the time of the loan sale is netted from the gain or loss recorded in mortgage banking activities, while any incremental provision, post loan sale, is recorded in other non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table provides a summary of activity in the reserve for loan repurchases:

The Company's DTAs, net increased by $ 19.3 million during 2020, reflecting the $ 31.2 million deferred tax benefit, a $ 15.9 million benefit recorded directly to shareholders' equity upon the January 1, 2020 adoption of CECL, and a $ 27.8 million expense allocated directly to shareholders' equity. 

The valuation allowance of $ 37.4 million and $ 38.2 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, is attributable to SALT net operating loss carryforwards, and the $ 0.8 million decrease during 2020 is associated with a related decrease in the Company's gross DTAs for those carryforwards, resulting in no net change to its overall DTAs, net. 

SALT net operating loss carryforwards approximated $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and are scheduled to expire in varying amounts during tax years 2024 through 2032. The valuation allowance has been established for approximately $ 630.8 million of those net operating loss carryforwards estimated to expire unused. Credit carryovers of $ 0.3 million, net at December 31, 2020 have a five-year carryover period and are scheduled to expire in varying amounts during tax years 2023 through 2025. 

Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its total DTAs, net of the valuation allowance. Although taxable income in prior years is no longer able to be included as a source of taxable income, due to the general repeal of the carryback of net operating losses under the Tax Act, significant positive evidence remains in support of management's conclusion regarding the realizability of the Company's DTAs, including projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and book-taxable income levels in recent and projected in future years. There can, however, be no assurance that any specific level of future income will be generated or that the Company&#8217;s DTAs will ultimately be realized. 

A deferred tax liability of $ 15.3 million has not been recognized for certain thrift bad-debt reserves, established before 1988, that would become taxable upon the occurrence of certain events: distributions by Webster Bank in excess of certain earnings and profits; the redemption of Webster Bank&#8217;s stock; or liquidation. Webster does not expect any of those events to occur. At December 31, 2020 the cumulative taxable temporary differences applicable to those reserves approximated $ 58.0 million. 

The following table reflects a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs): 

##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 4,813 &#160; $ 2,856 &#160; $ 3,595 &#160; Additions as a result of tax positions taken during the current year 87 &#160; 1,106 &#160; 249 &#160; Additions as a result of tax positions taken during prior years 572 &#160; 1,744 &#160; 71 &#160; Reductions as a result of tax positions taken during prior years ( 694 ) ( 238 ) ( 474 ) Reductions relating to settlements with taxing authorities ( 130 ) ( 18 ) ( 97 ) Reductions as a result of lapse of statute of limitation periods ( 396 ) ( 637 ) ( 488 ) Ending balance $ 4,252 &#160; $ 4,813 &#160; $ 2,856 &#160; ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were $ 3.5 million, $ 3.9 million, and $ 2.3 million, respectively, of UTBs that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. 

Webster recognizes interest and penalties related to UTBs, where applicable, in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, Webster recognized a benefit of $ 0.1 million, $ 0.1 million, and none , respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to UTBs of $ 1.7 million and $ 1.8 million respectively. 

Webster has determined it is reasonably possible that its total UTBs could decrease by an amount in the range of $ 1.6 million to $ 2.7 million by the end of 2021 as a result of potential lapses in statute-of-limitation periods and/or potential settlements with taxing authorities concerning various apportionment, tax-base, and research tax credit determinations. 

Webster's federal tax returns for all years subsequent to 2014 remain open to examination. Webster's tax returns to its principal state tax jurisdictions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island for years subsequent to 2014, or 2016, are either under or remain open to examination.

Common Stock 

Webster maintains a common stock repurchase program which authorizes management to purchase shares of its common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. On October 29, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a modification to this program, originally approved on October 24, 2017, increasing the maximum dollar amount available for repurchase to $ 200 million. Common stock repurchased during 2020 was acquired at an average cost of $ 36.38 per common share. The remaining repurchase authority under the common stock repurchase program was $ 123.4 million at December 31, 2020. 

Preferred Stock 

Webster has 6,000,000 depositary shares outstanding, each representing 1/1000th ownership interest in a share of Webster's 5.25 % Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $ 25,000 per share (equivalent to $ 25 per depositary share) (the Series F Preferred Stock). Webster will pay dividends as declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board. Dividends are payable at a rate of 5.25 % per annum, quarterly in arrears, on the fifteenth day of each March, June, September, and December. Dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock are not cumulative and are not mandatory. If for any reason the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board does not declare a dividend on the Series F Preferred Stock for any dividend period, such dividend will not accrue or be payable, and Webster will have no obligation to pay dividends for such dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend periods. The terms of the Series F Preferred Stock prohibit the Company from declaring or paying any cash dividends on its common stock, unless Webster has declared and paid full dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. 

The Company may redeem the Series F Preferred Stock, at its option in whole or in part, on December 15, 2022, or any dividend payment date thereafter, or in whole but not in part upon a "regulatory capital treatment event" as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series F Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights except with respect to authorizing or increasing the authorized amount of senior stock, certain changes to the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock, or in the case of certain dividend non-payments.

Note 15: Regulatory Matters 

Capital Requirements 

Webster Financial Corporation is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve System, while Webster Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC. Regulatory authorities can initiate certain mandatory actions if Webster Financial Corporation or Webster Bank fail to meet minimum capital requirements, which could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. These quantitative measures require minimum amounts and ratios to ensure capital adequacy. 

Total risk-based capital is comprised of three categories as defined by Basel III capital rules: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital includes common shareholders' equity, less deductions for goodwill, other intangibles, and certain deferred tax adjustments. For purposes of CET1 capital, common shareholders' equity excludes AOCI/AOCL components as permitted by the opt-out election taken by Webster upon adoption of Basel III. Tier 1 capital is comprised of CET1 capital plus perpetual preferred stock, while Tier 2 capital includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses, that together equal total capital. 

The following table provides information on the capital ratios for Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank:

(1) In accordance with regulatory capital rules, the Company elected an option to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral and subsequent three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of December 31, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses on loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and unfunded loan commitments attributed to the adoption of CECL, adjusted for an approximation of the after-tax provision for credit losses attributable to CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology during the deferral period. 

Dividend Restrictions. Webster Financial Corporation is dependent upon dividends from Webster Bank to provide funds for its cash requirements, including payments of dividends to shareholders. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations. Express approval by the OCC is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital the Bank to fall below specified minimum levels, or would exceed the net income for that year combined with the undistributed net income for the preceding two years. Webster Bank paid $ 20 million dividends to Webster Financial Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $ 360 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Cash Restrictions. Webster Bank is required by Federal Reserve System regulations to hold cash reserve balances on hand or with a Federal Reserve Bank. To address liquidity concerns due to COVID-19 the Federal Reserve reset the requirement to zero, effective March 26, 2020. The reserve requirement ratio is subject to adjustment as conditions warrant. Pursuant to this requirement, the Bank held $ 93.8 million at December 31, 2019.

(1) Earnings per common share amounts under the two-class method, for nonvested time-based restricted shares with nonforfeitable dividends and dividend rights, are determined the same as the presentation above. 

Dilutive Securities 

The Company maintains stock compensation plans under which restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and directors. The effect of dilutive securities for the periods presented is primarily the result of outstanding stock options, as well as non-participating restricted stock. 

Potential common shares from non-participating restricted stock of 44 thousand, 73 thousand, and 47 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, are excluded from the effect of dilutive securities because they would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. 

Refer to Note 20: Share-Based Plans for further information relating to potential common shares excluded from the effect of dilutive securities. 

Note 17: Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative Positions and Offsetting 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to change the fixed or variable nature of an interest rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Certain pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges to effectively convert variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt, while certain receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges to effectively convert fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate debt. Certain purchased options are designated as cash flow hedges. Purchased options allow the Company to limit the potential adverse impact of variable interest rates by establishing a cap or a floor rate in exchange for an upfront premium. The purchased options designated as cash flow hedges represent interest rate caps where payment is received from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the cap rate and interest rate floors where payment is received from the counterparty when interest rates fall below the floor rate. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships . The Company also enters into other derivative transactions to manage economic risks but does not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Further, the Company enters into derivative contracts to accommodate customer needs. Derivative contracts with customers are offset with dealer counterparty transactions structured with matching terms to ensure minimal impact on earnings. 

The following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of derivative positions:

Purchased options designated as cash flow hedges exclude time-value premiums from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Time-value premiums are amortized on a straight-line basis. At December 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized balance of time-value premiums was $ 9.0 million. 

Over the next twelve months, an estimated $ 10.3 million decrease to interest expense will be reclassified from AOCI/AOCL relating to cash flow hedges, and an estimated $ 0.3 million increase to interest expense will be reclassified from AOCI/AOCL relating to hedge terminations. At December 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized loss on terminated cash flow hedges is $ 1.0 million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 3.6 years. 

Additional information about cash flow hedge activity impacting AOCI/AOCL and the related amounts reclassified to interest expense is provided in Note 14: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax. Information about the valuation methods used to measure the fair value of derivatives is provided in Note 18: Fair Value Measurements. 

Derivative Exposure 

The Company had approximately $ 302.0 million in net margin posted with financial counterparties or the derivative clearing organization at December 31, 2020, which is primarily comprised of $ 79.0 million in initial margin collateral posted at CME and $ 252.0 million in CME variation margin posted. At December 31, 2020, $ 34.3 million of cash collateral received is included in cash and due from banks in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is considered restricted in nature. 

Webster regularly evaluates the credit risk of its derivative customers, taking into account the likelihood of default, net exposures, and remaining contractual life, among other related factors. Credit risk exposure is mitigated as transactions with customers are generally secured by the same collateral of the underlying transactions being hedged. Current net credit exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers was $ 296.3 million at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company monitors potential future exposure, representing its best estimate of exposure to remaining contractual maturity. The potential future exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers totaled $ 39.5 million at December 31, 2020. The Company has incorporated a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. The CVA was $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Various factors impact changes in the CVA over time, including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts, as well as changes in market rates and volatilities, which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments. 

Note 18: Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined using quoted market prices. However, in many instances, quoted market prices are not available. In such instances, fair values are determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques. Accordingly, categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate transfer of the respective asset or liability. 

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings or any part of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These factors are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1: Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

&#8226; Level 2: Fair value is calculated using significant inputs other than quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. The valuation may rely on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, rate volatility, prepayment speeds, credit ratings,) or inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by market data, by correlation, or other means. 

&#8226; Level 3: Inputs for determining the fair value of the respective assets or liabilities are not observable. Level 3 valuations are reliant upon pricing models and techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Available-for-Sale Investment Securities . When quoted prices are available in an active market, the Company classifies available-for-sale investment securities within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. Treasury Bills are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations, or methodologies, that appear unusual or unexpected. Available-for-Sale investment securities which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, CLO, and corporate debt, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative Instruments . Foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

All other derivative instruments are valued using third-party valuation software, which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions. The resulting fair value is validated against valuations performed by independent third parties and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Banking Derivatives . Forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are utilized by the Company in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Prior to closing and funding certain single-family residential mortgage loans, an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower. During the period from commitment date to closing date, the Company is subject to the risk that market rates of interest may change. If market rates rise, investors generally will pay less to purchase such loans resulting in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or, possibly, a loss. In an effort to mitigate such risk, forward delivery sales commitments are established, under which the Company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgage-backed securities. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and, therefore, classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Originated Loans Held For Sale . Residential mortgage loans typically are classified as held for sale upon origination based on management's intent to sell such loans. The Company generally records residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option of ASC Topic 825 " Financial Instruments ." Electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivatives used as an economic hedge on these assets. The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions. Accordingly, such loans are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table compares the fair value to unpaid principal balance of assets accounted for under the fair value option:

Investments Held in Rabbi Trust. Investments held in the Rabbi Trust primarily include mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. Shares of mutual funds are valued based on net asset value, which represents quoted market prices for the underlying shares held in the mutual funds. Therefore, investments held in the Rabbi Trust are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has elected to measure the investments held in the Rabbi Trust at fair value. The cost basis of the investments held in the Rabbi Trust is $ 1.6 million as of December 31, 2020. 

Alternative Investments. Equity investments have a readily determinable fair value when quoted prices are available in an active market. Accordingly, such alternative investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for NAV practical expedient measurement, based on specific requirements. The Company's alternative investments accounted for at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investments are distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Alternative investments recorded at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2020, these alternative investments had a remaining unfunded commitment of $ 22.0 million.

(2) Alternative investments are recorded at NAV. Assets measured at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. At December 31, 2020, no significant assets classified within Level 3 were identified and measured under this basis. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured on a non-recurring basis. 

Alternative Investments. The measurement alternative has been elected for alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the NAV practical expedient. The measurement alternative requires investments to be accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. These alternative investments are investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Accordingly, these alternative investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of these alternative investments was $ 17.4 million at December 31, 2020, which includes $ 1.6 million measured at fair value where there was net write-up identified due to observable price changes. No other adjustments or reductions for impairments were identified. 

Transferred Loans Held For Sale. Certain loans are transferred to loans held for sale once a decision has been made to sell such loans. These loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when they are recorded at below cost. This activity primarily consists of commercial loans with observable inputs and is classified within Level 2. On the occasion that these loans should include adjustments for changes in loan characteristics using unobservable inputs, the loans would be classified within Level 3. 

Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases. Loans and leases for which the payment is expected to be provided solely by the value of the underlying collateral are considered collateral dependent and are valued based on the estimated fair value of such collateral, less estimated cost to sell, using customized discounting criteria. Accordingly, such collateral dependent loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Right of Use Lease Assets. The carrying value of right of use lease assets at December 31, 2020 was $ 127.5 million, of which includes $ 1.5 million of right of use lease assets measured at fair value as the result of an impairment as part of the Company's decision to consolidate certain banking center locations. As such, ROU assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets. The total book value of OREO and repossessed assets was $ 2.3 million at December 31, 2020. OREO and repossessed assets are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when recorded below cost. The fair value of OREO is based on independent appraisals or internal valuation methods, less estimated selling costs. The valuation may consider available pricing guides, auction results, and price opinions. Certain assets require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market in the determination of fair value; as such, OREO and repossessed assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

In addition, the amortized cost of consumer loans secured by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure amounted to $ 14.9 million at December 31, 2020. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Servicing Assets 

The Company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, as well as servicing assets. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities. 

Cash, Due from Banks, and Interest-bearing Deposits . The carrying amount of cash, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits is used to approximate fair value, given the short time frame to maturity and, as such, these assets do not present unanticipated credit concerns. Cash, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities . When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations, or methodologies, that appear unusual or unexpected. Held-to-Maturity investment securities, which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, and municipal bonds and notes, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans and Leases, net . The estimated fair value of loans and leases held for investment is calculated using a discounted cash flow method, using future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity premium for comparable loans and leases. The associated cash flows are adjusted for credit and other potential losses. Fair value for collateral dependent loans and leases is estimated using the net present value of the expected cash flows. Loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Deposit Liabilities . The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Deposit liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Time Deposits . The fair value of a fixed-maturity certificate of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Time deposits are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings . The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings that mature within 90 days is the carrying value. Fair value for all other balances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates adjusted for associated credit risks, as appropriate. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt . The fair value of FHLB advances and long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique. Discount rates are matched with the time period of the expected cash flow and are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect credit risk. FHLB advances and long-term debt are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Assets . Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured under the amortization method. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future net servicing income and relies on market based assumptions for loan prepayment speeds, servicing costs, discount rates, and other economic factors; as such, the primary risk inherent in valuing mortgage servicing assets is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the servicing revenue stream. Mortgage servicing assets are reviewed quarterly and held at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Fair value adjustments, if any, are included as a component of loan related fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 19: Retirement Benefit Plans 

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Webster Bank offered a defined benefit noncontributory pension plan through December 31, 2007 for eligible employees who met certain minimum service and age requirements. Pension plan benefits are based upon employee earnings during the period of credited service. A supplemental defined benefit retirement plan (SERP) was also offered to certain employees who were at the Executive Vice President level or above through December 31, 2007. The SERP provides eligible participants with additional pension benefits. Webster Bank also provides postretirement healthcare benefits to certain retired employees. 

The Webster Bank Pension Plan and the SERP were frozen as of December 31, 2007. No additional benefits have been accrued since that time. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 receive no qualified or supplemental retirement income under the plans. All other employees accrue no additional qualified or supplemental retirement benefits after January 1, 2008, and the amount of their qualified and supplemental retirement benefits will not exceed the amount of benefits determined as of December 31, 2007. 

The measurement date is December 31 for the Webster Bank Pension Plan, SERP, and postretirement healthcare benefits. The mortality assumptions used in the pension liability assessment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were the Pri-2012 mortality table projected to measurement date with scale MP-2020.

Fair Value Measurement 

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets and includes the classification of those instruments within the valuation hierarchy: 

Exchange traded fund. The exchange traded fund has quoted market prices on an exchange, in an active market, which represents the net asset value of the shares held in the fund and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value for the exchange traded fund is benchmarked against the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 Index. 

Money market fund. The money market fund is carried at cost, which approximates fair value given the short time frame to maturity for cash and cash equivalents and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Common collective trusts. Common collective trusts hold investments in fixed income and equity funds. Transactions may occur daily within a trust. Should a full redemption of the trust be initiated, the investment advisor reserves the right to temporarily delay withdrawals in order to ensure that the liquidation of securities is carried out in an orderly business manner. Common collective trusts are benchmarked against the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 Stock Index, the S&#38;P 400 Mid Cap Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the MSCI ACWI ex U.S. Index, and the Barclays Capital U.S. Long Credit Index. As such, common collective trusts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

A summary of the fair value and hierarchy classification of financial assets of the pension plan is as follows:

(1) For 2019, the common collective trusts were reported in the NAV category in the fair value leveling table. Due to the readily available nature of the fair value (at NAV) for these investments, they have been classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy in current and prior periods presented.

The Retirement Plan Committee is a fiduciary under ERISA and is charged with the responsibility for directing and monitoring the investment management of the pension plan. To assist the Retirement Plan Committee in this function, it engages the services of investment managers and advisors who possess the necessary expertise to manage the pension plan assets within the established investment policy guidelines and objectives. The investment policy guidelines and objectives are reviewed at a minimum annually by the Retirement Plan Committee. 

The primary objective of the pension plan investment strategy is to provide long-term total return through capital appreciation and dividend and interest income. The Plan invests in registered investment companies and bank collective trusts. The volatility, as measured by standard deviation, of the pension plan assets should not exceed that of the Composite Index. The investment policy guidelines allow the pension plan assets to be invested in certain types of cash equivalents, fixed income securities, equity securities, mutual funds, and collective trusts. Investments in mutual funds and collective trust funds are substantially limited to funds with the securities characteristic of their assigned benchmarks. 

The investment strategy for the pension plan is designed to maintain a diversified portfolio with an expected weighted-average long-term rate of 5.50 %, however, there is no certainty that the portfolio will perform to expectations. Asset allocations are monitored monthly and the portfolio is re-balanced when appropriate. 

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:

Multiple-Employer Plan 

For the benefit of former employees of a bank acquired by the Company, the Bank is a sponsor of a multiple-employer pension plan that does not segregate the assets or liabilities of its employers participating in the plan. The plan administrator confirmed Webster Bank&#8217;s portion of the plan is under-funded by $ 2.6 million as of July 1, 2020, the date of the latest actuarial valuation. 

The following table sets forth contributions and funding status of Webster Bank's portion of this plan: 

##TABLE_START (Dollars in thousands) Contributions by Webster Bank for the year ended December 31, Funded Status of the Plan at December 31, Plan Name Employer Identification Number Plan Number 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions 13-5645888 333 $ 998 $ 863 $ 679 At least 80 percent At least 80 percent ##TABLE_END

Multi-employer accounting is applied to the Fund. As a multiple-employer pension plan, there are no collective bargained contracts affecting its contribution or benefit provisions. Any shortfall amortization basis is being amortized over seven years , as required by the Pension Protection Act. All benefit accruals were frozen as of September 1, 2004. The Company's contributions to this plan did not exceed more than 5% of total contributions in the plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. 

Webster Bank Retirement Savings Plan 

Webster Bank provides an employee retirement savings plan governed by section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Webster Bank matches 100 % of the first 2 % and 50 % of the next 6 % of employees&#8217; pre-tax contributions based on annual compensation. If a participant fails to make a pre-tax contribution election within 90 days of his or her date of hire, automatic pre-tax contributions will commence 90 days after his or her date of hire at a rate equal to 3 % of compensation. 

Compensation and benefit expense included $ 13.8 million, $ 13.2 million, and $ 12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, of employer contributions. 

Note 20: Share-Based Plans 

Stock Compensation Plans 

Webster maintains stock compensation plans to better align the interests of its employees and directors with those of its shareholders. The Plans have shareholder approval for up to 13.4 million shares of common stock. At December 31, 2020, there were 0.9 million common shares remaining available for grant, while no stock appreciation rights have been granted. Stock compensation cost is recognized over the required service vesting period for the awards, based on the grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, and is included as a component of compensation and benefits reflected in non-interest expense. 

Stock compensation expense for restricted stock of $ 12.2 million, $ 12.6 million, and $ 11.6 million, and an income tax benefit of $ 2.6 million, $ 6.1 million, and $ 8.5 million, was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020 there was $ 15.5 million of unrecognized stock compensation expense for restricted stock, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Time-based restricted stock . Time-based restricted stock awards vest over the applicable service period ranging from 1 to 3 years. The number of time-based awards that may be granted to an eligible individual in a calendar year is limited to 100,000 shares. Compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period based on fair value, which is measured using the Company's common stock closing price at the date of grant. 

Performance-based restricted stock . Performance-based restricted stock awards vest after a 3 year performance period. The awards vest with a share quantity dependent on that performance, in a range from zero to 150 %. The performance criteria for 50 % of the shares granted in 2020 is based upon Webster's ranking for total shareholder return versus Webster's compensation peer group companies and the remaining 50 % is based upon Webster's average of return on equity during the 3 year vesting period. The compensation peer group companies are utilized because they represent the financial institutions that best compare with Webster. The Company records compensation expense over the vesting period, based on a fair value calculated using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which allows for the incorporation of the performance condition for the 50 % of the performance-based shares tied to total shareholder return versus the compensation peer group, and based on a fair value of the market price on the date of grant for the remaining 50 % of the performance-based shares tied to Webster's return on equity. Compensation expense is subject to adjustment based on management's assessment of Webster's return on equity performance relative to the target number of shares condition. 

The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $ 13.5 million, $ 12.5 million, and $ 11.1 million, respectively. 

Stock options . Stock option awards have an exercise price equal to the market price of Webster Financial Corporation's stock on the date of grant. Each option grants the holder the right to acquire a share of Webster Financial Corporation common stock over a contractual life of up to 10 years. There have been no stock options granted since 2013. At December 31, 2020, there was stock options outstanding for 410,701 shares of common stock, all of which are exercisable, with a weighted-average exercise price of $ 23.35 and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years, comprised of 376,813 non-qualified stock options and 33,888 incentive stock options. 

Total pretax intrinsic value, which is the difference between Webster's closing stock price on the last trading day of the year and the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of shares, represents aggregate intrinsic value that would have been received by the option holders had they all exercised their options at that time. At December 31, 2020, as all awarded options have vested, all of the outstanding options are exercisable, and the aggregate intrinsic value of these options was $ 7.7 million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $ 0.1 million, $ 2.4 million, and $ 9.7 million, respectively. 

Note 21: Segment Reporting 

Webster&#8217;s operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses - Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Community Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, the type of customer served, how products and services are provided, and how discrete financial information is currently evaluated. Certain Corporate Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Description of Segment Reporting Methodology 

Webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing, and allocations for non-interest expense, provision for credit losses, income taxes, and equity capital. These estimates and allocations, certain of which are subjective in nature, are periodically reviewed and refined. Changes in estimates and allocations that affect the reported results of any operating segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Webster as a whole. The full profitability measurement reports, which are prepared for each operating segment, reflect non-GAAP reporting methodologies. The differences between full profitability and GAAP results are reconciled in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business, while any mismatch associated with the matched maturity funding concept called Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) is absorbed in corporate treasury activities. The allocation process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business. The matched maturity funding concept considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign a FTP rate for loans and deposits originated each day. Loans are assigned an FTP rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an FTP rate for funds provided. Beginning in 2020, Webster refined the FTP calculation to reflect the allocation of capital credit to net interest income to better align segment results with key measurements used to review segment performance. Prior period net interest income and income tax expense were revised to reflect this change. 

Webster allocates a majority of non-interest expense to each reportable segment using a full-absorption costing process. Costs, including corporate overhead, are analyzed, pooled by process, and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment. 

The results of funds transfer pricing and allocations for non-interest expense, as well as non-interest income produces pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue, under which basis the segments are reviewed by executive management.

The major types of revenue streams that are within the scope of ASC 606 are described below: 

Deposit service fees predominately consist of fees earned from deposit accounts and interchange fees. Fees earned from deposit accounts relate to event-driven services and periodic account maintenance activities. Webster's obligations for event-driven services are satisfied at the time the service is delivered, while the obligations for maintenance services is satisfied monthly. Interchange fees are assessed as the performance obligation is satisfied, which is at the point in time the card transaction is authorized. 

Wealth and investment services consists of fees earned from investment and securities-related services, trust and other related services. Obligations for wealth and investment services are generally satisfied over time through a time-based measurement of progress, but certain obligations may be satisfied at points in time for activities that are transactional in nature. 

These disaggregated amounts are reconciled to non-interest income as presented in Note 21: Segment Reporting. Contracts with customers have not generated significant contract assets and liabilities. 

Note 23: Commitments and Contingencies 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 

The Company offers credit-related financial instruments, in the normal course of business to meet certain financing needs of its customers, that involve off-balance sheet risk. These transactions may include an unused commitment to extend credit, standby letter of credit, or commercial letter of credit. Such transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. 

Commitments to Extend Credit . The Company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to customers at a future point in time. These commitments include revolving credit arrangements, term loan commitments, and short-term borrowing agreements. Most of these loans have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses where a fee may be required. Since commitments routinely expire without being funded, or after required availability of collateral occurs, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 

Standby Letter of Credit . A standby letter of credit commits the Company to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. The Company has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit, which is often part of a larger credit agreement under which security is provided. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of a standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the Company could be required to make, and is the Company's maximum credit risk. 

Commercial Letter of Credit . A commercial letter of credit is issued to facilitate either domestic or foreign trade arrangements for customers. As a general rule, drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. Similar to a standby letter of credit, a commercial letter of credit is often secured by an underlying security agreement including the assets or inventory they relate to. 

The following table summarizes the outstanding amounts of credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk: 

##TABLE_START At December 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Commitments to extend credit $ 6,517,840 &#160; $ 6,162,658 &#160; Standby letter of credit 207,201 &#160; 188,103 &#160; Commercial letter of credit 30,522 &#160; 29,180 &#160; Total credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk $ 6,755,563 &#160; $ 6,379,941 &#160; ##TABLE_END

These commitments subject the Company to potential exposure in excess of amounts recorded in the financial statements, and therefore, management maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for expected losses in connection with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend when those commitments are not unconditionally cancellable by Webster. Loss calculation factors are consistent with the ACL methodology for funded loans using PD and LGD applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades, a draw down factor applied to utilization rates, and relevant forecast information. The allowance is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The following table provides a summary of activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments:
