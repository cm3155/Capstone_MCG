 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 

This discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is necessary to understand Webster's financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to 2021. The following should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in Webster Financial Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 25, 2022, and in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the future results that may be attained for the entire year or other interim periods. 

Executive Summary 

Nature of Operations 

Webster Financial Corporation (the Holding Company) is a bank holding company and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1986, and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Webster Bank, National Association (Webster Bank) is the principal consolidated subsidiary of Webster Financial Corporation. Webster Bank, and its HSA Bank division (HSA Bank), deliver a wide range of banking, investment, and financial services to individuals, families, and businesses. Webster Bank serves consumer and business customers with mortgage lending, financial planning, trust, and investment services through a distribution network consisting of banking centers, ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services throughout the northeastern U.S. from New York to Massachusetts, with certain businesses operating in extended geographies. Webster Bank also offers equipment financing, warehouse lending, commercial real estate lending, asset-based lending, and treasury management solutions. HSA Bank is a leading provider of health savings accounts (HSAs), and delivers health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending and commuter benefit account administration services to employers and individuals in all 50 states. 

Business Developments 

On January 31, 2022, Webster completed its previously announced merger with Sterling in an all-stock transaction valued at $5.2 billion. The merger expanded Webster's geographic footprint and combined two complementary organizations to create one of the largest commercial banks in the northeastern U.S. At September 30, 2022, the combined company had $69.1 billion in assets, $47.8 billion in loans and leases, and $54.0 billion in deposits, and operated 201 banking centers throughout southern New England and metro and suburban New York. In addition, on February 18, 2022, Webster acquired 100% of the equity interests of Bend Financial, Inc. (Bend), a cloud-based platform solution provider for HSAs, in exchange for cash. The Bend acquisition accelerated Webster&#8217;s efforts underway to deliver enhanced user experiences at HSA Bank. Financial results for historical reporting periods reflect only the results of Webster's operations prior to the corresponding merger or acquisition. 

The successful integration of Webster&#8217;s and Sterling&#8217;s operations depends on the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully consolidate business operations, management teams, corporate cultures, operating systems, and controls procedures, and eliminate costs and redundancies. Noteworthy accomplishments as of September 30, 2022, include the rebranding of branches and digital assets, the coordination of credit policies and procedures, the selection of certain key operating systems, the consolidation of commercial credit risk management systems and commercial client pricing tools, as well as mortgage servicing, payroll, and treasury platforms, the finalization of governance and executive management structures, the establishment of a corporate responsibility office to oversee community engagement, philanthropy, and sustainability, and the participation of senior Company leaders and managers at culture-shaping workshops, with plans for Company-wide participation in such workshops to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2022. Other key operating systems and process integration activities are ongoing, and Webster remains well-positioned to successfully execute its core conversion targeted for mid-2023. 

In addition, Webster developed and launched a corporate real estate consolidation strategy during the second quarter of 2022 in which the Company arranged to close 14 locations, primarily throughout New York and Connecticut, in order to reduce its corporate facility square footage by approximately 45% by the end of the year. As of the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Webster has recognized $23.1 million in right-of-use (ROU) asset impairment charges and a combined $12.0 million in related exit costs and accelerated depreciation on property and equipment related to this corporate real estate consolidation strategy. 

Furthermore, in connection with the Sterling merger, Webster re-evaluated its strategic priorities as a combined organization, which resulted in modifications to the Company's strategic initiatives that were announced in December 2020. As a result, the Company released $4.1 million from its previously recorded severance accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. 

Additional information regarding Webster's mergers and acquisitions and related integration initiatives can be found within Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The non-GAAP financial measures identified in the preceding table provide both management and investors with information useful in understanding Webster's financial position, results of operations, the strength of its capital position, and overall business performance. These measures are used by management for internal planning and forecasting purposes, as well as by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance. Management believes that this presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting Webster's business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner. 

Tangible book value per common share represents shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets (tangible common equity) divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The tangible common equity ratio represents tangible common equity divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (tangible assets). Both of these measures are used by management to evaluate Webster's capital position. The annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated using net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the annualized tax-effected amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. This measure is used by management to assess Webster's performance against its peer financial institutions. The efficiency ratio, which represents the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is calculated excluding certain non-operational items in order to measure how well Webster is managing its recurring operating expenses. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these with other companies that present financial measures having the same or similar names. 

The following tables reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures defined by GAAP: At September 30, (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Tangible book value per common share: Shareholders' equity $ 7,826,410 $ 3,386,189 Less: Preferred stock 283,979 145,037 Goodwill and other intangible assets 2,721,040 557,360 Tangible common shareholders' equity $ 4,821,391 $ 2,683,792 Common shares outstanding 174,116 90,588 Tangible book value per common share $ 27.69 &#160; $ 29.63 &#160; Tangible common equity ratio: Tangible common shareholders' equity $ 4,821,391 $ 2,683,792 Total assets 69,052,566 35,374,258 Less: Goodwill and other intangible assets 2,721,040 557,360 Tangible assets $ 66,331,526 $ 34,816,898 Tangible common equity ratio 7.27 &#160; % 7.71 &#160; %

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is Webster's primary source of revenue, representing 82.9% and 80.9% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 73.3% and 74.3% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and leases and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund interest-earning assets and other activities. Net interest margin is calculated as the ratio of tax-equivalent net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Tax-equivalent adjustments are determined assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. 

Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rate levels, re-pricing frequencies, contractual maturities, prepayment behavior, and the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments. These factors are affected by changes in economic conditions, which impacts monetary policies, competition for loans and deposits, as well as the extent of interest lost on non-performing assets. 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Net interest income increased $321.3 million, or 139.9%, from $229.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $551.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $332.1 million. Net interest margin increased 74 basis points from 2.80% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 3.54% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase, which includes net purchase accounting accretion from acquired loans and leases, investment securities, and interest-bearing liabilities, is primarily attributed to the merger with Sterling, along with the rising interest rate environment. 

Average interest-earning assets increased $29.3 billion, or 89.2%, from $32.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $62.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increases of $24.7 billion and $6.1 billion in average loans and leases and average total investment securities, respectively, which were partially offset by a $1.7 billion decrease in average interest-bearing deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 104 basis points from 2.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 3.96% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest-earning assets and the increase in average yield were both impacted by the Sterling merger, as well as higher market rates. 

Average loans and leases increased $24.7 billion, or 114.6%, from $21.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $46.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, which was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as loan growth across the commercial non-mortgage and commercial real estate categories. This growth was partially offset by lower Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan balances and commercial portfolio loan sales. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, the loan and lease portfolio comprised 74.3% and 65.5% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on loans and leases increased 92 basis points from 3.60% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 4.52% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a higher yield on the acquired Sterling loans and leases, net purchase accounting accretion, and higher market rates. 

Average total investment securities increased $6.1 billion, or 68.8%, from $8.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $15.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, the investment securities portfolio comprised 24.2% and 27.1% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on investment securities increased 39 basis points from 2.01% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 2.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the reinvestment of maturing securities at higher yields and a higher yield on the acquired Sterling investment securities portfolio net of purchase premium amortization. 

Average interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB decreased $1.7 billion, or 74.9%, from $2.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $0.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to excess customer liquidity in the prior period as a result of government stimulus and reduced spending. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB comprised 0.9% and 7.1% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB increased 204 basis points from 0.15% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 2.19% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher market rates. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $27.7 billion, or 89.2%, from $31.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $58.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increases of $24.1 billion, $0.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $0.5 billion, in average total deposits, average federal funds purchased, average Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, and average long-term debt, respectively. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 32 basis points from 0.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 0.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding federal funds and FHLB advances, and the subordinated debt assumed from Sterling in the merger. 

Average total deposits increased $24.2 billion, or 80.8%, from $29.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $54.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting increases of $6.4 billion and $17.7 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits, respectively. The overall increase in deposits was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as the strong liquidity position of both commercial and consumer customers, and HSA growth. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, deposits comprised 91.8% and 96.0% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on deposits increased 22 basis points from 0.06% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 0.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the rising interest rate environment. Time deposits as a percentage of total interest-bearing deposits decreased from 8.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 6.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to customer preferences to hold more liquid deposit products. 

Average federal funds purchased were $0.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and had an average rate of 2.24%. There were no average federal funds purchased for the three months ended September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022, federal funds purchased comprised 1.5% of total average interest-bearing liabilities. 

Average FHLB advances increased $2.3 billion, from $0.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to short-term funding needs. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, FHLB advances comprised 4.09% and 0.39% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on FHLB advances increased 66 basis points from 1.59% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 2.25% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher market rates on new short-term borrowings. 

Average long-term debt increased $0.5 billion, or 90.5%, from $0.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. At both September 30, 2022, and 2021, long-term debt comprised 1.8% of total average interest-bearing liabilities. The average rate on long-term debt increased 25 basis points from 3.22% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to 3.47% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the subordinated debt assumed from Sterling in the merger. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Net interest income increased $757.6 million, or 112.4%, from $674.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $783.3 million. Net interest margin increased 50 basis points from 2.85% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 3.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase which includes net purchase accounting accretion from acquired loans and leases, investment securities, and interest-bearing liabilities, is primarily attributed to the merger with Sterling, along with the rising interest rate environment. 

Average interest-earning assets increased $25.7 billion, or 80.6%, from $31.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $57.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increases of $20.6 billion and $5.6 billion in average loans and leases and average total investment securities, respectively, which were partially offset by a $810.7 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 62 basis points from 2.98% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 3.60% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest-earning assets and the increase in average yield were both impacted by the Sterling merger, as well as higher market rates. 

Average loans and leases increased $20.6 billion, or 96.1%, from $21.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $42.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as loan growth across the commercial non-mortgage and commercial real estate categories. This growth was partially offset by lower PPP loan balances and commercial portfolio loan sales. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, the loan and lease portfolio comprised 73.2% and 67.4% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on loans and leases increased 60 basis points from 3.54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 4.14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a higher yield on the acquired Sterling loans and leases, net purchase accounting accretion, and higher market rates. 

Average total investment securities increased $5.6 billion, or 63.9%, from $8.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $14.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as the deployment of excess liquidity. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, the investment securities portfolio comprised 25.3% and 27.9% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on investment securities increased 13 basis points from 2.09% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 2.22% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily due to the reinvestment of maturing securities at higher yields. 

Average interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB decreased $810.7 million, or 56.5% from $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $623.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to excess customer liquidity in the prior period as a result of government stimulus and reduced spending. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB comprised 1.08% and 4.50% of total average interest-earnings assets, respectively. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB increased 87 basis points from 0.13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to 1.00% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher market rates. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $24.1 billion, or 80.1%, from $30.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $54.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increases of $22.2 billion, $0.5 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.4 billion in average total deposits, average federal funds purchased, average FHLB advances, and average long-term debt, respectively. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 13 basis points from 0.14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 0.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher market rates and the mix of funding sources. 

Average total deposits increased $22.2 billion, or 76.6%, from $28.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $51.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting increases of $6.0 billion and $16.2 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits, respectively. The overall increase in deposits was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as the strong liquidity position of retail and commercial customers, and HSA growth. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, deposits comprised 94.1% and 96.0% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on deposits increased 8 basis points from 0.07% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 0.15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the rising interest rate environment, which was partially offset by the run-off of time deposits. Time deposits as a percentage of total interest-bearing deposits decreased from 9.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 6.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to customer preferences to hold more liquid deposit products. 

Average federal funds purchased increased $456.6 million, from $21.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $478.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to short-term funding needs. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, federal funds purchased comprised 0.9% and 0.1% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on federal funds purchased increased 167 basis points from 0.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 1.75% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher market rates. 

Average FHLB advances increased $1.1 billion, or 810.9%, from $0.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to short-term funding needs. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, FHLB advances comprised 2.2% and 0.4% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on FHLB advances increased 33 basis points from 1.54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 1.87% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher market rates on new short-term borrowings. 

Average long-term debt increased $0.4 billion, or 79.7%, from $0.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. At both September 30, 2022, and 2021, long-term debt comprised 1.9% of total average interest-bearing liabilities. The average rate on long-term debt increased 18 basis points from 3.22% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to 3.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the subordinated debt assumed from Sterling in the merger.

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

The provision for credit losses increased $28.7 million, or 371.4%, from $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, to $36.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributed to the release of reserves in the prior period as a result of improvements in the forecasted economic outlook and favorable credit trends as the COVID-19 pandemic receded, as well as organic loan growth and commercial portfolio optimization initiatives. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, total net charge-offs were $28.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The $27.6 million increase is primarily attributed to commercial portfolio optimization initiatives, as well as favorable credit performance in 2021 as the economy benefited from the support of federal stimulus programs. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

The provision for credit losses increased $277.1 million, or 701.6%, from a benefit of $39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to an expense of $237.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributed to the establishment of the initial ACL of $175.1 million for non-purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) loans and leases that were acquired from Sterling, as well as organic loan growth and commercial portfolio optimization initiatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, total net charge-offs were $47.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The $42.0 million increase is primarily attributed to commercial portfolio optimization initiatives, as well as favorable credit performance in 2021 as the economy benefited from the support of federal stimulus programs. 

Additional information regarding the Company's provision for credit losses and ACL can be found under the sections captioned "Loans and Leases" through "Allowance for Credit Losses" contained elsewhere in Part I - Item 2.

Deposit service fees increased $10.5 million, or 26.2%, from $40.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $50.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, particularly as it relates to cash management fees, overdraft fees, and account service charges, as well as higher interchange revenue. 

Loan and lease related fees increased $15.9 million, or 146.0%, from $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, which included $2.7 million of operating lease income, and an increase in loan servicing fees net of mortgage servicing amortization. 

Wealth and investment services increased $1.4 million, or 14.4%, from $10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. 

Mortgage banking activities decreased $1.4 million, or 94.4%, from $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to lower originations for sale, as the Company continues to execute on its strategic decision to originate residential mortgage loans for investment rather than for sale. 

The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $4.0 million, or 110.5%, from $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the additional bank-owned life insurance policies acquired in the merger with Sterling. 

Net loss on sale of investment securities, totaled $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as Webster sold $67.5 million of Municipal bonds and notes classified as available-for-sale for proceeds of $65.3 million. There were no sales of investment securities during the three months ended September 30, 2021. 

Other income increased $1.6 million, or 9.2%, from $17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $19.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in other income due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, higher income from client interest rate derivative activities, and a $2.5 million net gain on the extinguishment of borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in direct investment income. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Total non-interest income increased $105.4 million, or 45.2%, from $233.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $338.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due to increases in deposit service fees, loan and lease related fees, wealth and investment services, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and other income, the majority of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking activities and a net loss on sale of investment securities. 

Deposit service fees increased $27.8 million, or 22.8%, from $122.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $150.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, particularly as it relates to cash management fees, overdraft fees, and account service charges, as well as higher interchange revenue. 

Loan and lease related fees increased $50.3 million, or 185.9%, from $27.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $77.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, which included $8.0 million of operating lease income, as well as increases in loan servicing fees net of mortgage servicing amortization, prepayment penalties, and syndication fees. 

Wealth and investment services increased $3.8 million, or 12.8%, from $29.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $33.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. 

Mortgage banking activities decreased $4.9 million, or 88.8%, from $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to lower originations for sale, as the Company continues to execute on its strategic decision to originate residential mortgage loans for investment rather than for sale. 

The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $11.9 million, or 110.1%, from $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the additional bank-owned life insurance policies acquired in the merger with Sterling. 

Net loss on sale of investment securities, totaled $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as Webster sold $67.5 million of Municipal bonds and notes classified as available-for-sale for proceeds of $65.3 million. There were no sales of investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Other income increased $18.7 million, or 48.7%, from $38.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $56.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in other income due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, higher income from client interest rate derivative activities, gains on sale of commercial loans not originated for sale, and a $2.5 million net gain on the extinguishment of borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in direct investment income.

Compensation and benefits increased $68.6 million, or 65.1%, from $105.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $174.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to incremental salaries and incentives related to the increase in employees as a result of the merger with Sterling, and the $3.9 million reversal of severance in the prior period due to changes in retention assumptions associated with the Company's strategic initiatives announced in December 2020, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in merger-related expenses. 

Occupancy increased $11.1 million, or 89.2%, from $12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $23.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the Company's consolidation plan to reduce its corporate facility square footage, which resulted in a combined $4.3 million in related exit costs and accelerated depreciation on property and equipment, in addition to incremental operating lease costs and depreciation related to the acquired Sterling banking centers and corporate offices. 

Technology and equipment increased $16.9 million, or 59.2%, from $28.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $45.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in technology and equipment due to the impact of the merger with Sterling. 

Intangible assets amortization increased $7.4 million, or 657.2%, from $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, due to the additional amortization expense related to the core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition. 

Professional and outside services increased $14.5 million, or 205.6%, from $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an $8.8 million increase in merger-related expenses, particularly as it relates to advisory, legal, and consulting fees, and an increase in other professional service costs due to the impact of the merger with Sterling. 

Deposit insurance increased $4.1 million, or 108.2%, from $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the Company's deposit insurance assessment base resulting from the merger with Sterling. 

Other expense increased $27.0 million, or 147.9%, from $18.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $45.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in other expenses due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, which includes $2.1 million of operating lease depreciation, as well as a $10.5 million common stock contribution to the Webster Bank Charitable Foundation, and a $3.0 million increase in merger-related expenses, particularly as it relates to disposals of property and equipment. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Total non-interest expense increased $492.8 million, or 88.8%, from $555.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy, technology and equipment, intangible assets amortization, professional and outside services, deposit insurance, and other expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. 

Compensation and benefits increased $234.9 million, or 75.6%, from $310.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $545.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to incremental salaries and incentives related to the increase in employees as a result of the merger with Sterling, and a $63.3 million increase in merger-related expenses, particularly as it relates to severance, retention, and restricted stock awards. 

Occupancy increased $51.6 million, or 122.7%, from $42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $93.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the Company's consolidation plan to reduce its corporate facility square footage, which resulted in $23.1 million ROU asset impairment charges and a combined $12.0 million in related exit costs and accelerated depreciation on property and equipment, as well as additional operating lease costs and depreciation related to the acquired Sterling banking centers and corporate offices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in strategic initiatives charges. 

Technology and equipment increased $58.1 million, or 69.1%, from $84.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $142.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a $21.3 million increase in merger-related expenses, particularly as it relates to contract termination costs, and an overall increase in technology and equipment due to the impact of the merger with Sterling. 

Intangible assets amortization increased $20.3 million, or 598.1%, from $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due to the additional amortization expense related to the core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition. 

Professional and outside services increased $53.1 million, or 140.4%, from $37.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $91.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a $40.8 million increase in merger-related expenses, particularly as it relates to advisory, legal, and consulting fees, and an increase in other professional service costs due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, partially offset by a decrease in strategic initiative charges. 

Deposit insurance increased $8.4 million, or 73.0%, from $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the Company's deposit insurance assessment base resulting from the merger with Sterling. 

Other expense increased $64.8 million, or 115.6%, from $56.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $120.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in other expenses due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, which includes $6.2 million of operating lease depreciation, along with a $12.5 million increase in merger-related expenses, particularly as it relates to disposals of property and equipment, and a $10.5 million common stock contribution to the Webster Bank Charitable Foundation. 

Income Taxes 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Webster recognized income tax expense of $64.1 million and $29.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively, reflecting effective tax rates of 21.5% and 23.7%, respectively. 

The increase in income tax expense is due to a higher level of pre-tax income recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2022, resulting from the impact of the Company's merger with Sterling. The decrease in the effective tax rate primarily reflects increased tax-exempt income and net benefits from tax credits in 2022 as compared to 2021 (including increases in the amounts estimated for the full year 2022 in Webster's estimated annual effective tax rate computation at September 30, 2022), resulting from the merger with Sterling. These factors were partially offset by the effects of a higher level of pre-tax income and rate of state and local tax (SALT) in 2022 as compared to 2021, and a $2.9 million deferred SALT expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2022, each also resulting from the merger with Sterling. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Webster recognized income tax expense of $85.3 million and $94.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively, reflecting effective tax rates of 17.6% and 24.0%, respectively. 

The decrease in both income tax expense and the effective tax rate primarily reflects the one-time charges incurred by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as a result of the merger with Sterling, along with a $10.9 million net deferred SALT benefit recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, associated with the merger with Sterling, which includes a $9.9 million benefit recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2022, related to a change in management's estimate about the realizability of its SALT deferred tax assets (DTAs) due to an estimated increase in future taxable income. 

At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, Webster recorded a valuation allowance on its DTAs of $29.2 million and $37.4 million, respectively. The $29.2 million at September 30, 2022, reflects a reduction of $9.9 million for the change in estimate discussed above, and includes a $1.7 million valuation allowance related to the Bend acquisition. At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, Webster's gross DTAs included $67.1 million and $64.4 million, respectively, applicable to SALT net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income. The $67.1 million at September 30, 2022, includes $5.6 million related to the Sterling merger and $1.1 million related to the Bend acquisition. Webster's total gross DTAs at September 30, 2022, also included $5.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition, which are subject to annual limitations on utilization. 

The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are available. In making its assessment, management considers the Company's forecasted future results of operations, estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for SALT purposes, and also applies longer-term growth rate assumptions. Based on its estimates, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its DTAs, net of the valuation allowance, at September 30, 2022. However, it is possible that some or all of Webster's net operating loss and credit carryforwards could expire unused, or that more net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be utilized than estimated, either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the Company's forecasts and, in turn, impact its future results of operations. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA includes various tax provisions, which are generally effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. While Webster is still evaluating these tax law changes, it does not expect them to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Additional information regarding Webster's income taxes, including its DTAs, can be found within Note 10: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Segment Reporting 

Webster's operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses: Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Consumer Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, how discrete financial information is evaluated, the type of customer served, and how products and services are provided. Segments are evaluated using pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR). Certain Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. Additional information regarding the Company's reportable segments and its segment reporting methodology can be found within Note 16: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Effective January 1, 2022, Webster realigned its investment services operations from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. Under this realignment, $125.4 million of deposits and $4.3 billion of assets under administration (off-balance sheet) were reassigned from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking. There was no goodwill reallocation nor goodwill impairment as a result of the reorganization. In addition, the non-interest expense allocation methodology was modified to exclude certain overhead and merger-related costs that are not directly related to segment performance. Prior period results of operations have been recast accordingly to reflect the realignment. 

The following is a description of Webster&#8217;s three reportable segments and their primary services: 

Commercial Banking serves corporate customers with more than $2 million of revenues through its Commercial Real Estate, Business Banking, Capital Finance, Middle Market, Public Sector Finance, Sponsor and Specialty Finance, Mortgage Warehouse Lending, Private Banking, and Treasury Management components. 

HSA Bank offers a comprehensive consumer-directed healthcare solution that includes HSAs, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits. HSAs are used in conjunction with high deductible health plans in order to facilitate tax advantages for account holders with respect to health care spending and savings, in accordance with applicable laws. HSAs are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers, as well as through national and regional insurance carriers, benefit consultants, and financial advisors. HSA Bank deposits provide long duration, low-cost funding that is used to minimize the Company&#8217;s use of wholesale funding in support of its loan growth. In addition, non-interest revenue is generated predominantly through service fees and interchange income. 

Consumer Banking serves individual customers and small businesses with less than $2 million of revenues by offering consumer deposits, residential mortgages, home equity lines, secured and unsecured loans, debit and credit card products, and investment services. Consumer Banking operates a distribution network consisting of 201 banking centers and 354 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services, primarily throughout southern New England and the New York Metro and Suburban markets. 

Management anticipates that the presentation of Consumer Banking's operating results in the fourth quarter of 2022 will be impacted by a restructuring of the process by which the Company offers brokerage, investment advisory, and certain insurance-related services to customers. The staff providing these services, which had previously been employees of Webster Bank at September 30, 2022, will now be employees of a third-party service provider. As a result, Webster will recognize income from this program on a net basis, which will reduce gross reported non-interest income and corresponding compensation non-interest expense. This restructuring is not expected to have a significant net impact on PPNR. 

Commercial Banking 

Operating Results: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 333,554 $ 152,012 $ 954,044 $ 434,087 Non-interest income 40,497 22,782 128,670 59,536 Non-interest expense 102,415 50,244 294,375 142,803 Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue $ 271,636 $ 124,550 $ 788,339 $ 350,820 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Commercial Banking's PPNR increased $147.1 million, or 118.1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. The $181.6 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to incremental loan and deposit balances acquired from Sterling, loan and deposit growth, and higher interest rates. The $17.7 million increase in non-interest income is primarily attributed to incremental fee income due to the merger, partially offset by lower direct investment income. The $52.2 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses incurred related to the acquired Sterling commercial business, and costs to support growth within the loan and deposit portfolios. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Commercial Banking's PPNR increased $437.5 million, or 124.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. The $520.0 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to incremental loan and deposit balances acquired from Sterling, loan and deposit growth, and higher interest rates. The $69.1 million increase in non-interest income is primarily attributed to incremental fee income due to the merger, as well as increased client hedging activity and loan and lease related fees, partially offset by lower direct investment income. The $151.6 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses incurred related to the acquired Sterling commercial business, and costs to support growth within the loan and deposit portfolios. 

Selected Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Information: (In thousands) At September 30, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Loans and leases $ 38,493,281 $ 15,209,515 Deposits 20,828,493 9,519,362 Assets under administration / management (off-balance sheet) 2,121,313 2,869,385 

Loans and leases increased $23.3 billion, or 153.1%, at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as growth within the commercial real estate and the commercial non-mortgage categories. Total portfolio originations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $10.6 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The $6.7 billion increase was primarily attributed to the merger with Sterling, along with increased commercial non-mortgage and commercial real estate originations. 

Deposits increased $11.3 billion, or 118.8%, at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. 

Commercial Banking held $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion in assets under administration and $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion in assets under management at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The combined decrease of $0.8 billion, or 26.1%, was primarily due to lower valuations in the equity markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

HSA Bank 

Operating Results: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 58,567 $ 42,074 $ 152,702 $ 126,376 Non-interest income 25,842 24,756 79,352 78,315 Non-interest expense 36,725 32,374 110,674 100,802 Pre-tax net revenue $ 47,684 $ 34,456 $ 121,380 $ 103,889 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

HSA Bank's pre-tax net revenue increased $13.2 million, or 38.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. The $16.5 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to an increase in the net interest rate spread on deposits and overall deposit growth. The $1.1 million increase in non-interest income is primarily due to higher interchange income from increased debit card spending. The $4.4 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses from Bend's acquired business, as well as an increase in compensation, temporary help, and travel expenses. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

HSA Bank's pre-tax net revenue increased $17.5 million, or 16.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. The $26.3 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to an increase in the net interest rate spread on deposits and overall deposit growth. The $1.1 million increase in non-interest income is primarily due to higher interchange income from increased debit card spending. The $9.9 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses from Bend's acquired business, as well as an increase in temporary help, consulting, and travel expenses. 

Selected Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Information: (In thousands) At September 30, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Deposits $ 7,889,296 $ 7,397,997 Assets under administration, through linked investment accounts (off-balance sheet) 3,232,793 3,718,610 

Deposits increased $491.3 million, or 6.6%, at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the number of account holders and organic deposit growth, which was partially offset by a decrease in third party administrator deposits. HSA Bank's deposits accounted for approximately 14.6% and 24.8% of Webster's total consolidated deposits at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, with the lower mix driven by the inflow of deposits as a result of the merger with Sterling. 

Assets under administration, through linked investment accounts, decreased $485.8 million, or 13.1%, at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower valuations in the equity markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which was partially offset by additional account holders and balances from the acquisition of Bend. 

Consumer Banking 

Operating Results: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 195,748 $ 98,572 $ 511,712 $ 281,012 Non-interest income 33,842 24,292 92,541 71,262 Non-interest expense 109,588 73,212 312,464 222,672 Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue $ 120,002 $ 49,652 $ 291,789 $ 129,602 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 

Consumer Banking's PPNR increased $70.4 million, or 141.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. The $97.2 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to incremental loan and deposit balances acquired from Sterling, loan and deposit growth, and higher interest rates. The $9.6 million increase in non-interest income is primarily attributed to incremental fee income due to the merger, coupled with higher deposit servicing fees, loan and lease related fees, and investment services income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking activities. The $36.4 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses incurred related to the acquired Sterling consumer business, partially offset by lower shared services charges. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Consumer Banking's PPNR increased $162.2 million, or 125.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. The $230.7 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to incremental loan and deposit balances acquired from Sterling, loan and deposit growth, and lower interest paid on deposits. The $21.3 million increase in non-interest income is primarily attributed to incremental fee income due to the merger, as well as higher deposit servicing and loan and lease related fees, partially offset by lower mortgage banking activities. The $89.8 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses incurred related to the acquired Sterling consumer business, which was partially offset by the benefits of cost savings initiatives implemented over the course of 2021. 

Selected Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Information: (In thousands) At September 30, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Loans $ 9,302,048 $ 7,062,182 Deposits 23,859,373 12,926,302 Assets under administration (off-balance sheet) 7,369,382 4,332,901 

Loans increased $2.2 billion, or 31.7%, at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling and growth in residential mortgages, partially offset by the forgiveness of PPP loans and the continued run-off of consumer Lending Club loans. Total portfolio originations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The $0.4 billion decrease was primarily attributed to increased market rates, which resulted in lower residential mortgage loan originations, as well as the cessation of PPP loan originations effective May 31, 2021. 

Deposits increased $10.9 billion, or 84.6%, at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, partially offset by attrition from maturing certificates of deposits. 

Consumer Banking held $7.4 billion and $4.3 billion in assets under administration at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $3.1 billion increase was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, partially offset by lower valuations in the equity markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets increased $34.2 billion, or 97.8%, from $34.9 billion at December 31, 2021 to $69.1 billion at September 30, 2022. The change in total assets was primarily attributed to the following: 

&#8226; Total investment securities, net increased $4.2 billion, with increases of $3.9 billion and $0.3 billion in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, respectively, primarily due to $4.4 billion of investment securities acquired from Sterling in the merger, all of which were classified as available-for-sale based on Webster's intent at closing, and purchases exceeding paydown activities, partially offset by an increase in net unrealized losses within the available-for-sale portfolio; 

&#8226; Loans and leases increased $25.6 billion, with increases of $23.3 billion and $2.3 billion in the commercial and consumer portfolios, respectively, primarily due to $20.5 billion of gross loans and leases acquired from Sterling in the merger, which included a $317.6 million purchase discount. Webster also originated $12.7 billion of loans and leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, particularly across the commercial non-mortgage and commercial real estate categories. These increases were partially offset by net paydowns, commercial portfolio loan sales, the forgiveness of PPP loans, and the run-off of consumer Lending Club loans. In addition, Webster recorded $88.0 million and $175.1 million of initial ACL for the PCD and non-PCD loans and leases acquired from Sterling, respectively, which primarily contributed to the $273.1 million increase in the ACL on loans and leases. 

&#8226; Goodwill and other net intangible assets increased a combined $2.2 billion. Goodwill increased $2.0 billion, which reflects the $1.9 billion and $36.0 million recognized in connection with the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition, respectively. The $189.4 million increase in other net intangible assets is due to the $119.1 million core deposit and $94.0 million customer relationship intangible assets acquired from Sterling and Bend, respectively, partially offset by year to date amortization charges; and 

&#8226; Accrued interest receivable and other assets increased $937.5 million, primarily due to $959.5 million of balances acquired from Sterling in the merger. Notable increases include $153.5 million in accrued interest receivable, $61.9 million in alternative investments, $607.3 million in LIHTC investments, and a combined $41.2 million in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $84.7 million in treasury derivative assets. 

Total liabilities increased $29.7 billion, or 94.5%, from $31.5 billion at December 31, 2021 to $61.2 billion at September 30, 2022. The change in total liabilities was primarily attributed to the following: 

&#8226; Total deposits increased $24.2 billion, with increases of $6.8 billion and $17.4 billion in non-interest bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits, respectively, primarily due to $23.3 billion of deposits assumed from Sterling in the merger; 

&#8226; Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings increased $0.6 billion, primarily due to the purchase of $1.0 billion in federal funds, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in securities sold under agreements to repurchase resulting from the extinguishment of two $100 million structured repurchase agreements and the timing of maturities during the third quarter of 2022; 

&#8226; FHLB advances increased $3.5 billion, primarily due to short-term funding needs. 

&#8226; Long-term debt increased $511.9 million, primarily due to $499.0 million aggregate par value of subordinated notes assumed from Sterling in the merger, adjusted for a $17.9 million purchase premium, which is being amortized over the remaining lives of the subordinated notes; and 

&#8226; Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $984.9 million, primarily due to $595.3 million of balances assumed from Sterling in the merger, and the timing of payments for compensation and benefits and professional services. Other notable increases include $424.4 million in treasury derivative liabilities, $99.3 million in operating lease liabilities, and $300.2 million in unfunded commitments for LIHTC investments. 

Total shareholders' equity increased $4.4 billion, or 127.6%, from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021 to $7.8 billion at September 30, 2022. The change in total shareholders' equity was attributed to the following: 

&#8226; Common shares issued in the merger with Sterling totaling approximately $5.0 billion, of which $43.9 million pertained to replacement share-based compensation awards; 

&#8226; The conversion of Sterling Series A preferred stock into Webster Series G preferred stock at a fair value of $138.9 million; 

&#8226; Net income recognized of $399.5 million; 

&#8226; Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders of $178.0 million and $11.8 million, respectively; 

&#8226; Other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of $714.3 million, primarily due to market value decreases in the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio and cash flow hedges; 

&#8226; A common stock contribution of $10.5 million to the Webster Bank Charitable Foundation; 

&#8226; Employee share-based compensation plan activity of $43.2 million, inclusive of restricted stock amortization and forfeitures, and stock options exercised of $0.6 million; and 

&#8226; Repurchases of common stock of $319.3 million under the Company's common stock repurchase program and $22.5 million related to employee share-based compensation plans. 

Investment Securities 

Through its Corporate Treasury function, Webster maintains and invests in debt securities that are primarily used to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs, to generate interest income, and as a means to manage the Company's interest-rate risk. Webster's debt securities are classified into two major categories: available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

The Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) manages the Company's debt securities in accordance with regulatory guidelines and corporate policies, which include limitations on aspects such as concentrations in and types of investments, as well as minimum risk ratings per type of security. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may further establish individual limits on certain types of investments if the concentration in such investment presents a safety and soundness concern. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Webster had investment securities with a total net carrying value of $14.6 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively, with an average risk weighting for regulatory purposes of 19.2% and 12.5%, respectively. Although the Bank held the entirety of Webster's investment portfolio at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Holding Company may also directly hold investments.

(1) The balances at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, exclude the ACL recorded on held-to-maturity debt securities of $0.2 million. 

Available-for-sale debt securities increased $3.9 billion, or 90.9%, from $4.2 billion at December 31, 2021 to $8.1 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as the Company acquired $4.4 billion of debt securities at fair value on January 31, 2022, all of which were classified as available-for-sale based on Webster's intent at closing. The debt securities acquired from Sterling resulted in a $221.6 million net purchase premium over par value accounted for as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method. Webster also purchased an additional $1.1 billion of available-for sale debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net unrealized losses, as well as paydowns, maturities, sales, and net premium amortization activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, particularly across the Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, Municipal bonds and notes, and CMBS categories. 

The tax-equivalent yield in the available-for-sale portfolio was 2.38% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2.20% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to 1.74% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 1.80% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The 64 basis point and 40 basis point increases, respectively, are attributed to higher rates on securities purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Available-for-sale debt securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses were $941.8 million and $34.3 million, respectively. The $907.5 million increase is primarily due to the increased portfolio size from the merger with Sterling, and higher market rates. Because these unrealized losses were attributable to factors other than credit deterioration, no ACL was recorded during the current period. At September 30, 2022, Webster did not intend to sell these investment securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to the anticipated recovery of their cost basis. 

Held-to-maturity investment securities increased $0.3 billion, or 5.0%, from $6.2 billion at December 31, 2021 to $6.5 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily due to purchases exceeding paydowns, maturities, and net premium amortization, particularly across the Agency CMBS, Agency MBS, and Municipal bonds and notes categories. The tax-equivalent yield in the held-to-maturity portfolio was 2.43% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to 2.17% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The 26 basis point increase is attributed to higher rates on securities purchased in the current period. The tax equivalent yield in the held-to-maturity portfolio remained flat at 2.25% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Held-to-maturity debt securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis under the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses were $856.8 million and $55.7 million, respectively. The $801.1 million increase is primarily due to higher market rates. The ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities was $0.2 million at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit Policies and Procedures 

Webster Bank has credit policies and procedures in place designed to support its lending activities within an acceptable level of risk, which are reviewed and approved by management and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. To assist with this process, management inspects reports generated by the Company's loan reporting systems related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans. 

Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, equipment finance, and warehouse lending loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate and service its debt. Assessment of the borrower's management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision. Once it has been determined that the borrower&#8217;s management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen, current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations, as contracted. Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrower's ability to originate high-quality, first-mortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency, government, or private jumbo markets, and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower. However, the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans, as applicable, may fluctuate in value. Most commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance. Warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities. 

Commercial real estate loans, including multi-family, are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, equipment finance, and warehouse lending loans. These loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans, and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan, the market in which the property is located, and the tenants of the property securing the loan. The properties securing the Company&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location, which reduces the Company's exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. All transactions are appraised to determine market value. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Management periodically utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio. 

Consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio. These policies and procedures, coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures, are spread across many different borrowers, minimizing the level of credit risk. Trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis, and policies and procedures are modified or developed, as needed. Underwriting factors for residential mortgage and home equity loans include the borrower&#8217;s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, the loan amount relative to property value, and the borrower&#8217;s debt-to-income level. Webster Bank originates both qualified mortgage and non-qualified mortgage loans, as defined by applicable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The ACL on loans and leases increased $273.1 million, or 90.7%, from $301.2 million at December 31, 2021, to $574.3 million at September 30, 2022, primarily due to the initial ACL of $88.0 million and $175.1 million recorded for PCD and non-PCD loans and leases, respectively, that were acquired from Sterling, as well as organic loan growth and commercial portfolio optimization initiatives. The establishment of the initial ACL for PCD loans and leases is net of $48.3 million in charge-offs, which were recognized upon completion of the merger in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the ACL across the loans and leases categories:

(1) The ACL allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. 

Methodology 

Webster's ACL on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy. The ACL on loans and leases is a contra-asset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset. Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance, which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios. 

The ACL on loans and leases is determined using the CECL model, whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset, including those acquired through a business combination, which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset. The calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Generally, expected credit losses are determined through a pooled, collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics. However, if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool, it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses. The total ACL on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments. 

Collectively Assessed Loans and Leases . Collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type, credit quality, risk ratings, and/or collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios, and expected losses are determined using a Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD), loss rate, or discounted cash flow framework. 

For portfolios using the PD/LGD/EAD framework, credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting, expected loss given the occurrence of a default, and the expected exposure of a loan at default. Summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio. Management's PD and LGD calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, historical loss information, loan-level risk attributes, and credit quality indicators. The calculation of EAD follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio. The calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses, the loan's amortization schedule, and prepayment rates. 

Under the loss rate method, expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date. For each loan segment identified above, we apply an expected historical loss trend based on third-party loss estimates, correlate them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. Under the discounted cash flow method, expected credit losses are determined by comparing the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date to the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments expected to be collected over the remaining life of the asset. Our loss model generates cash flow projections at the loan level based on reasonable and supportable projections, from which we estimate payment collections adjusted for curtailments, recovery time, PD and LGD. 

Webster's models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to long-term expectations, with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts. Reversion towards long-term expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years. Certain models use output reversion and revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straight-line basis in the third year of the forecast. Other models use input reversion and revert to the mean of macroeconomic variables in reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

Webster incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses. Macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors, such as asset type and the correlation of the variables to credit losses, among others. Data from the forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation. 

A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. Qualitative factors are based on our judgement of the company, market, industry, or business specific data including loan trends, portfolio segment composition, and loan rating or credit scores. Qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses, particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity. 

Individually Assessed Loans and Leases . If the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool, it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses. Generally, all non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructures (TDRs), potential TDRs, loans with a charge-off, and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, are individually assessed. The measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent. Methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell (when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral), or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. For non-collateral dependent loans, either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used. Any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset.

Asset Quality Ratios 

Webster manages asset quality using risk tolerance levels established through the Company's underwriting standards, servicing, and management of its loan and lease portfolio. Loans and leases for which a heightened risk of loss has been identified are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration and preserve asset quality in future periods. Non-performing assets, credit losses, and net charge-offs are considered by management to be key measures of asset quality.

(1) Percentage represents annualized year-to-date net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans and leases within the comparable category. 

Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 0.25% and 0.15% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 0.02% and 0.03% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The increased level of net charge-offs is primarily attributed to commercial portfolio optimization initiatives, as well as favorable credit performance in 2021 as the economy benefited from the support of federal stimulus programs. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Webster manages its cash flow requirements through proactive liquidity measures at both the Holding Company and Webster Bank in order to maintain stable, cost-effective funding and to promote overall balance sheet strength. The liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to balance sources and uses of funds, as needed. At September 30, 2022, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s liquidity position, capital resources, or operating activities. Further, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, that if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Cash inflows are provided through a variety of sources, including as operating activities such as principal and interest payments on loans and investments, financing activities, such as unpledged securities that can be sold or utilized to secure funding, and new deposits. Webster is committed to maintaining a strong base of core deposits, which consists of demand, interest-bearing checking, savings, health savings, and money market accounts, in order to support growth in its loan and lease portfolio. 

Holding Company Liquidity. The primary source of liquidity at the Holding Company is dividends from Webster Bank. To a lesser extent, investment income, net proceeds from investment sales, borrowings, and public offerings may provide additional liquidity. The Holding Company generally uses its funds for principal and interest payments on senior notes, subordinated notes, and junior subordinated debt, dividend payments to preferred and common shareholders, repurchases of its common stock, and purchases of investment securities, as applicable. 

There are certain restrictions on Webster Bank's payment of dividends to the Holding Company, which are described within Note 10: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements, and in the section captioned "Supervision and Regulation" in Part I - Item 1. Business of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Webster Bank paid $375.0 million in dividends to the Holding Company. At September 30, 2022, there were $544.5 million of retained earnings available for the payment of dividends by Webster Bank to the Holding Company. On October 25, 2022, Webster Bank was approved to pay the Holding Company $100.0 million in dividends during the fourth quarter of 2022. 

The quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders remained at $0.40 per common share during the three months ended September 30, 2022. On October 25, 2022, it was announced that Webster&#8217;s Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share on its common stock. For its Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, Webster declared quarterly cash dividends of $328.125 per share and $16.25 per share, respectively. Webster continues to monitor economic forecasts, anticipated earnings, and its capital position in the determination of its dividend payments. 

Webster maintains a common stock repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors, that authorizes management to purchase shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any adopted predetermined trading plan subject to certain conditions. On April 27, 2022, the Board of Directors increased Webster's authority to repurchase shares of its common stock under the repurchase program by $600.0 million in shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company repurchased 6,336,742 shares under the program at a weighted-average price of $50.38 per share totaling $319.3 million. The remaining purchase authority at September 30, 2022 was $404.2 million. In addition, the Company will periodically acquire common shares outside of the repurchase program related to stock compensation plan activity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a total of 392,670 shares were repurchased at a weighted-average price of $57.40 per share totaling $22.5 million for this purpose. 

The IRA, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, imposes a 1% excise tax on net repurchases of stock by certain publicly traded corporations, including Webster. The excise tax is to be imposed on the value of the net stock repurchased, or treated as repurchased, and will apply to the Company's stock repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. 

On July 8, 2022, the Holding Company made an unrestricted and unconditional contribution of 242,270 Webster common shares to the Webster Bank Charitable Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization with a focus on education and community development that serves communities in the Greater New York City, Lower Hudson Valley, Long Island, and New Jersey areas. The fair value of these shares based on their closing price on the contribution date was $10.5 million. 

Webster Bank Liquidity. Webster Bank's primary source of funding is core deposits. Including time deposits, Webster Bank had a loan to total deposit ratio of 88.5% and 74.6% at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The 13.9% point increase is attributed to loan growth exceeding deposit growth. 

Webster Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. The adequacy of liquidity, as assessed by the OCC, depends on factors such as overall asset and liability structure, market conditions, competition, and the nature of the institution&#8217;s deposit and loan customers. At September 30, 2022, Webster Bank exceeded all regulatory liquidity requirements. Webster has designed a detailed contingency plan in order to respond to any liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner, including early detection of potential problems and corrective action to address liquidity stress scenarios. 

Capital Requirements. Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by the Basel III Capital Rules to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, defined by Basel III capital rules (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital, Total capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (as defined in the regulations). At September 30, 2022, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank were classified as well-capitalized. Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to quarter-end that would change this designation. 

In accordance with regulatory capital rules, Webster elected an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of CECL on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral period, which ended on January 1, 2022, and subsequent three-year transition period ending on December 31, 2024. During the three-year transition period, capital ratios will begin to phase out the aggregate amount of the regulatory capital benefit provided from the delayed CECL adoption during the initial two years. For 2022, 2023, and 2024, Webster is allowed 75%, 50%, and 25% of the regulatory capital benefit as of December 31, 2021, respectively, with full absorption occurring in 2025. At September 30, 2022, the benefit allowed from the delayed CECL adoption resulted in a 9, 9, and 6 basis point increase to Webster Financial Corporation's and Webster Bank's CET1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (CET1 risk-based capital), Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (Tier 1 risk-based capital), and Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (Tier 1 leverage capital), respectively, and a 2 basis point decrease to Total capital to total risk-weighted assets (Total risk-based capital). Both Webster Financial Corporation's and Webster Bank's regulatory ratios remain in excess of being well-capitalized, even without the benefit of the delayed CECL adoption impact. 

Additional information regarding the required regulatory capital levels and ratios applicable to Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank can be found within Note 10: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I -Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Sources and Uses of Funds 

Sources of Funds . The primary source of cash flows for Webster Bank&#8217;s use in its lending activities and general operational needs is deposits. Operating activities, such as loan and securities repayments, proceeds from loans and securities held for sale, and maturities also provide cash flows. While scheduled loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, prepayments and other deposit inflows are influenced by economic conditions and prevailing interest rates, the timing of which is inherently uncertain. Additional sources of funds are provided by both short-term and long-term borrowings, and to a lesser extent, dividends received as part of the Bank's membership with the FHLB and FRB. 

Deposits. Webster Bank offers a wide variety of checking and savings deposit products designed to meet the transactional and investment needs of both its consumer and business customers. The Bank&#8217;s deposit services include, but are not limited to, ATM and debit card use, direct deposit, ACH payments, mobile banking, internet-based banking, banking by mail, account transfers, and overdraft protection, among others. The Bank manages the flow of funds in its deposit accounts and interest rates consistent with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulations. Both Webster Bank&#8217;s Retail Pricing Committee and its Commercial and Institutional Liability Pricing Committee meet regularly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives. 

Total deposits were $54.0 billion and $29.8 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $24.2 billion increase was primarily attributed to the deposits assumed from Sterling in the merger. Customer preferences for maintaining liquidity resulted in higher balances across savings and money market accounts, as customers with maturing time deposits opted to migrate to more liquid products. The aggregate amount of time deposits accounts that exceeded the FDIC limit of $250,000 represented 1.0% and 0.9% of total deposits at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Additional information regarding period-end deposit balances and rates can be found within Note 7: Deposits in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Borrowings. Webster Bank's primary borrowing sources include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, and long-term debt. Total borrowed funds were $5.8 billion and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and represented 8.5% and 3.6% of total assets, respectively. The $4.6 billion increase is primarily attributed to increases of $3.5 billion, $1.0 billion, and $0.5 billion in FHLB advances, federal funds purchased, and long-term debt, respectively, partially offset by a $0.4 billion decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 

Webster Bank had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $3.5 billion and $5.1 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Bank also had additional borrowing capacity from the FRB of $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Unpledged investment securities of $6.5 billion at September 30, 2022 could have been used for collateral on borrowings or to increase borrowing capacity by either $6.0 billion with the FHLB or $6.3 billion with the FRB. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally a form of short-term funding in which the Bank sells securities to counterparties with an agreement to buy them back in the future at a fixed price. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $0.3 billion and $0.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $0.4 billion decrease is primarily attributed to the extinguishment of two $100 million structured repurchase agreements during the third quarter of 2022, and the overall timing of maturities. 

The Bank may also purchase term and overnight federal funds to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Federal funds purchased totaled $1.0 billion at September 30, 2022. There were no federal funds purchased at December 31, 2021. 

FHLB advances are not only utilized as a source of funding, but also for interest rate risk management purposes. FHLB advances totaled $3.5 billion and $11.0 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $3.5 billion increase is primarily attributed short-term funding needs. 

Long-term debt consists of senior fixed-rate notes maturing in 2024 and 2029, subordinated fixed-to-floating-rate notes maturing in 2029 and 2039, and floating-rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2033. Long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $0.5 billion increase is primarily attributed to the subordinated notes assumed from Sterling in the merger.

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of eleven district Federal Home Loan Banks, each of which is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. An activity-based capital stock investment in the FHLB is required in order for Webster Bank to maintain its membership and access to advances and other extensions of credit for sources of funds and liquidity purposes. The FHLB capital stock investment is restricted as there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FHLB. Webster Bank held FHLB capital stock of $148.9 million and $11.3 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The most recent FHLB quarterly cash dividend was paid on November 2, 2022 in an amount equal to an annual yield of 5.16%. 

Webster Bank is also required to hold FRB stock equal to 6% of its capital and surplus, of which 50% is paid. The remaining 50% is subject to call when deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve System. Similar to FHLB stock, the FRB capital stock investment is restricted as there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FRB. Webster Bank held FRB capital stock of $224.1 million and $60.5 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The most recent FRB semi-annual cash dividend was paid on June 30, 2022 in an amount equal to an annual yield of 3.03%. 

Webster Bank changed its location for the purposes of Federal Reserve Regulation D from the Federal Reserve District of Boston to the Federal Reserve District of New York effective June 1, 2022. 

Uses of Funds. Webster enters into various contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments and could impact the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The following table summarizes significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations at September 30, 2022. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented. Based on Webster's current liquidity position, it is expected that our sources of funds will be sufficient to fulfill these obligations when they come due. 

&#160; &#160;

(1) Interest payments on borrowings have been excluded. 

In addition, in the normal course of business, Webster offers financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, and commercial and standby letters of credit, which involve to a varying degree, elements of credit risk. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially funded, the total commitment amount of $11.2 billion at September 30, 2022 does not necessarily reflect future cash payments. 

Webster also enters into commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, as well as low income housing tax credit investments to assist the Bank in meeting its responsibilities under the CRA. The total unfunded commitment for these alternative investments was $406.1 million at September 30, 2022. However, the timing of capital calls cannot be reasonably estimated, and depending on the nature of the contract, the entirety of the capital committed by Webster may not be called. 

Pension obligations are funded by the Company, as needed, to provide for participant benefit payments as it relates to Webster's frozen, non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan. Decisions to contribute to the defined benefit pension plan are made based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. Webster does not currently anticipate that it will make a contribution in 2022. Webster's non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans and other post employment benefit plans, including those acquired from Sterling in the merger, are unfunded. 

At September 30, 2022, Webster's condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $10.4 million and $2.3 million of accrued interest and penalties. The ultimate timing and amount of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. 

Additional information regarding credit-related financial instruments, alternative investments, defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and income taxes can be found within Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies, Note 11: Variable Interest Entities, Note 15: Retirement Benefit Plans, and the under the section captioned "Income Taxes", respectively, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Part I - Item. 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, respectively. 

Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk 

An effective asset/liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short-term and long-term interest rate risks when determining management's strategy and action. To facilitate this, interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the ALCO. The primary goal of ALCO is to manage interest rate risk and to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments. ALCO meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment securities and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook, its interest rate expectations, the portfolio risk position, and other factors. 

Four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk: 

&#8226; the size, duration, and credit risk of the investment portfolio; 

&#8226; the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio; 

&#8226; interest rate contracts; and 

&#8226; the pricing and structure of loans and deposits. 

Management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate Webster's earnings at risk and equity at risk. Essentially, interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion, and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate based scenario. The flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecasted horizon. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the flat rate scenario assumed a federal funds rate of 3.25% and 0.25%, respectively. The federal funds rate target range was 3.00-3.25% at September 30, 2022 and 0-0.25% at December 31, 2021. Since interest rates have begun to rise, management has incorporated both the down 100 and 200 basis point rate scenarios back into its assessment of interest rate risk. As interest rates continue to rise, scenarios that include upward and downward shifts of greater magnitude will also be incorporated. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points might have on Webster's net interest income over a twelve month period starting at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates: 

-200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp September 30, 2022 (7.5)% (3.6)% 3.7% 8.0% December 31, 2021 n/a n/a 4.9% 10.7% 

Asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income decreased at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis post-merger and the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio. Loans at floors have decreased $4.3 billion, from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 to $0.2 billion at September 30, 2022. While loans with floors, which are considered "in the money", have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity, as interest rates start to rise, these loans will move through their floors and begin to reprice accordingly. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates might have on Webster's net interest income for the subsequent twelve month period starting at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp September 30, 2022 (5.2)% (2.4)% 2.1% 4.3% (2.0)% (1.1)% 0.8% 1.9% December 31, 2021 n/a n/a 3.2% 7.3% (3.1)% (1.4)% 1.3% 2.6% 

These non-parallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down 50 and 100 basis points, while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged, and vice versa. The short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months. The results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes. 

Sensitivity to the short end and long end of the yield curve for net interest income decreased at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis post-merger, as well as the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio and slower forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of increases in the yield curve, which in turn, extends the duration for mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. 

The following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets, financial liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

(Dollars in thousands) Book Value Estimated Economic Value Estimated Economic Value Change -100 bp +100 bp September 30, 2022 Assets $ 69,052,566 $ 65,316,826 $ 1,289,617 $ (1,286,543) Liabilities 61,226,156 52,888,246 2,342,346 (1,300,747) Net $ 7,826,410 $ 12,428,580 $ (1,052,729) $ 14,204 Net change as % base net economic value (8.5) % 0.1 % December 31, 2021 Assets $ 34,915,599 $ 34,515,422 n/a $ (801,524) Liabilities 31,477,274 30,015,357 n/a (988,401) Net $ 3,438,325 $ 4,500,065 n/a $ 186,877 Net change as % base net economic value n/a 4.2 % 

Changes in economic value can best be described through duration, which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. For fixed-rate financial instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time to receive future cash flows, whereas for floating-rate financial instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time until the next rate reset. Overall, the longer the duration, the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. Generally, increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixed-rate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason. A reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to Webster. Floating-rate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day, and therefore, may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. 

Duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities. A duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched, and therefore, would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Webster's duration gap was negative 1.4 years and negative 1.8 years, respectively. A negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets, and therefore, liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace. Consequently, Webster's net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise, as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets. The opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall. Earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise, and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term, absent the effects of any new business booked in the future. At September 30, 2022, long-term rates have risen by 230 basis points as compared to December 31, 2021. This higher starting point extends financial asset duration by decreasing residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities prepayment speeds. 

These earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ, and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates. Management believes that the Company's interest rate risk position at September 30, 2022 represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook. Management continues to monitor interest rates and other relevant factors given recent market volatility and is prepared to take additional action, as necessary.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Webster's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying notes thereto, is based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which can be found within Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements, and in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and that require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and which could potentially result in materially different amounts using different assumptions or under different conditions. 

Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on Webster's financial condition or results of operations. Webster's most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates are those related to the ACL on loans and leases and business combinations. These critical accounting policies, including its underlying estimates, are discussed directly with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The ACL on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within Webster's loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date. The calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a PD/LGD/EAD, loss rate, or discounted cash flow framework, and include consideration of past events, current conditions, macroeconomic variables (such as unemployment, gross domestic product, property values, and interest rate spreads), and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Changes to the ACL on loans and leases, and therefore, to the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect financial results. 

The determination of the appropriate level of ACL on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires Webster to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, all of which may undergo frequent and material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that Webster is more susceptible to, unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics, along with new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problems loans, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors, both within and outside the Company's control, may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the ACL on loans and leases. 

It is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the ACL and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Further, changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. 

Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the ACL on loans and leases on a quarterly basis. Although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets, the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios. 

Business Combinations 

The acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or third-party valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals. Particularly, the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the Sterling merger include estimates related to discount rates, credit risk, and other relevant factors, which are inherently subjective. A description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Sterling merger can be found within Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements.
