Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

Webster Financial Corporation: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Webster Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Assessment of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to loans and leases collectively evaluated for impairment 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan and lease losses for loans and leases collectively evaluated for impairment (non-impaired ALLL) was $194.8 million of the total allowance for loan and lease losses of $209.1 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company estimated the quantitative valuation allowance for non-impaired commercial loans and leases using a historical loss methodology that estimates the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD), which are based on credit risk ratings. The Company estimated the quantitative valuation allowance for non-impaired consumer loans using roll rate models which estimate probable inherent losses. The models calculate the roll rate at which loans migrate from one delinquency category to the next worse delinquency category and eventually to loss. In addition, the Company&#8217;s non-impaired ALLL includes a qualitative element consisting of qualitative factors determined based on general economic conditions and other factors that may be internal or external to the Company. 

We identified the assessment of the non-impaired ALLL as a critical audit matter because it involves significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment, and knowledge and experience in the industry. This assessment encompassed the evaluation of the non-impaired ALLL methodology, inclusive of the methodologies used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and their key factors and assumptions, including the look back periods, the loss emergence periods, and risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, (2) the roll rates and their key factors and assumptions, including the look back periods, the loss emergence periods, and the pay down factors by product type for consumer loans, and (3) the qualitative factors. 

The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the (1) development and approval of the non-impaired ALLL methodology, (2) determination of the key factors and assumptions used to estimate the PD and LGD and the roll rates, (3) determination of the qualitative factors, and (4) analysis of the ALLL results. We tested management&#8217;s process to develop the non-impaired ALLL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. We evaluated the qualitative factor framework and related adjustments by (1) evaluating the determination of each qualitative factor adjustment, and (2) evaluating trends in the non-impaired ALLL, inclusive of the qualitative factor adjustments, for consistency with changes in the loan portfolio and credit performance. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized industry knowledge and experience who assisted in evaluating: 

&#9642; the non-impaired ALLL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, 

&#9642; the look back period assumptions by (1) evaluating that loss data in the look back period is representative of the credit characteristics of the current portfolio and (2) evaluating the sufficiency of loss data within the look back period, 

&#9642; the appropriateness of the methodology used to develop the loss emergence period assumption by considering the Company&#8217;s credit risk policies, 

&#9642; the appropriateness of the methodology used to develop the pay down factors by considering consumer loan balance changes over time by product type, 

&#9642; the framework used to develop the resulting qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the non-impaired ALLL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends, including the maximum qualitative factor adjustment and the metrics, and 

&#9642; the appropriateness of credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans and leases. 

Assessment of the realizability of the deferred tax asset associated with the Company's state and local tax net operating loss carryforwards 

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, the Company had $69.8 million of net operating losses (NOLs) and credit carry forwards related to state and local taxes (SALT), which are recorded as a deferred tax asset (DTA). A valuation allowance of $38.2 million was recorded at December 31, 2019 related to SALT NOLs. The determination of the valuation allowance is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, including the amount of taxable income necessary to realize a DTA in future periods. 

We identified the assessment of the realizability of the DTAs associated with the Company&#8217;s SALT NOLs as a critical audit matter due to the complexity and related auditor judgment required to evaluate the future taxable income that would be necessary to realize the DTA. This assessment encompassed the evaluation of estimates and assumptions related to the projections of taxable income, allocation of income among its relevant legal entities, and estimates of SALT apportionment rates. 

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company&#8217;s SALT DTA valuation allowance assessment process, including controls over the determination of the estimates and assumptions. We evaluated the Company&#8217;s projections of taxable income by (1) comparing the historical taxable income projections to actual results to assess the Company&#8217;s ability to accurately forecast, (2) evaluating the forecasted growth rates for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, by comparing the growth assumptions to historical experience, strategy, and industry outlooks, (3) testing projections of net interest income by comparing interest rates used to historical rates and third-party forecasted rates, and (4) comparing the long-term growth rate assumption to third-party forecasted rates and industry research. We evaluated the allocation of income among its relevant legal entities by comparing to historical allocations taking in to consideration forecasted growth. We evaluated the SALT apportionment rates by comparing to historical apportionment rates and by re-performing the calculation of the rates based on forecasted SALT taxable income. We involved federal and SALT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the Company&#8217;s application of the relevant tax laws and regulations and in evaluating the SALT apportionment rates.

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Operations 

Webster Financial Corporation is a bank holding company and financial holding company under the BHC Act, incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1986 and headquartered in Waterbury, Connecticut. Webster Bank is the principal consolidated subsidiary of Webster Financial Corporation. Webster Bank and its HSA Bank division deliver a wide range of banking, investment, and financial services to individuals, families, and businesses. 

Webster Bank serves consumer and business customers with mortgage lending, financial planning, trust, and investment services through a distribution network consisting of banking centers, ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services throughout southern New England and Westchester County, New York. It also offers equipment financing, commercial real estate lending, asset-based lending, and treasury and payment solutions primarily in the eastern U.S. HSA Bank is a leading provider of health savings accounts, while also delivering health reimbursement arrangements, and flexible spending and commuter benefit account administration services to employers and individuals in all 50 states. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company that materially affect its financial statements conform with GAAP, and align with general practices within the financial services industry. The Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes thereto include the accounts of Webster Financial Corporation and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Assets that the Company holds or manages in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers, typically referred to as assets under administration or assets under management, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets as those assets are not Webster's, and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had an immaterial effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The purpose of consolidated financial statements is to present the results of operations and the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, the consolidated financial statements include any voting interest entity (VOE) in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and any variable interest entity (VIE) for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company generally consolidates its VOEs if the Company, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the entity and the non-controlling shareholders do not hold any substantive participating or controlling rights. 

The Company evaluates VIEs to understand the purpose and design of the entity, and its involvement in the ongoing activities of the VIE and will consolidate the VIE if it has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses of the VIE, or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The Company accounts for unconsolidated partnerships and certain other investments using the equity method of accounting if it has the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of the investee. This is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of a corporation, or when it has greater than 3%-5% interest in a limited partnership or similarly structured entity. Refer to Note 2: Variable Interest Entities for further information. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as income and expense during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents, as referenced in the consolidated statement of cash flows, is comprised of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits. Cash equivalents have a maturity of three months or less. 

Cash and due from banks, as referenced in the consolidated balance sheets, includes cash on hand, certain deposits at the FRB of Boston, and cash due from banks. Restricted cash related to Federal Reserve System requirements and cash collateral received on derivative positions are included in cash and due from banks. 

Interest-bearing deposits, as referenced in the consolidated balance sheets, includes deposits at the FRB of Boston in excess of reserve requirements and federal funds sold to other financial institutions. Federal funds sold essentially represents an uncollateralized loan and therefore the Company regularly evaluates the credit risk associated with the other financial institutions to assure that Webster does not become exposed to any significant credit risk on those cash equivalents. 

Investment in Debt Securities 

Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. Any classification change subsequent to trade date is reviewed for compliance with corporate objectives and accounting policies. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are those which Webster has the ability and intent to hold to maturity. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost net of unamortized premiums and discounts. Discount accretion income and premium amortization expense are recognized as interest income using the effective interest method, with consideration given to prepayment assumptions on mortgage backed securities. Premiums are amortized to the earliest call date for debt securities purchased at a premium, with explicit, non-contingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset date. Securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) or other comprehensive loss (OCL). If securities are transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity they are recorded at fair value at the time of transfer and the respective gain or loss would be recorded as a separate component of OCI or OCL and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of such security. 

Securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity and in an unrealized loss position are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. The evaluation considers several qualitative factors, including the period of time the security has been in a loss position, and the amount of the unrealized loss. If the Company intends to sell a debt security or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, it is written down to fair value, and the loss is recognized in non-interest income. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, only the credit component of the unrealized loss is recorded as an impairment charge in non-interest income. The remaining loss component would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax (AOCL). 

Debt security transactions are recognized on the trade date, which is the date the order to buy or sell the security is executed. The carrying value plus any related accumulated OCI or OCL balance of sold securities is used to calculate the realized gain or loss on sale. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on sales of securities. Refer to Note 3: Investment Securities for further information. 

Investment in Equity Securities 

The Company&#8217;s accounting treatment for equity investments differs for those with and without readily determinable fair values. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company elected the measurement alternative, and therefore carry these investments at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in observable prices. Certain equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for net asset value (NAV) measurement based on specific requirements. The Company's alternative investments accounted for at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investments are distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews its equity investments without readily determinable fair values for impairment. If the equity investment is considered impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value is recorded through a charge to earnings. The impairment loss may be reversed in a subsequent period if there are observable transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer at a higher amount than the carrying amount that was established when the impairment was recognized. Impairment as well as upward or downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments are included in non-interest income. 

Equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock 

Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve System, and is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the FHLB of Boston and FRB of Boston. Based on redemption provisions, the stock of both the FHLB and the FRB has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Membership stock is reviewed for impairment as economic circumstances warrant special review. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans that are classified as held for sale at the time of origination are accounted for under the fair value option. Loans not originated for sale but subsequently transferred to held for sale are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and are valued on an individual asset basis. Any cost amount in excess of fair value is recorded as a valuation allowance and recognized as a reduction of other non-interest income. 

Gains or losses on the sale of loans held for sale are recorded as part of mortgage banking activities. Cash flows from the sale of loans that were originated specifically for resale are presented as operating cash flows. Cash flows from the sale of loans originated for investment then subsequently transferred to held for sale are presented as investing cash flows. Refer to Note 5: Transfers of Financial Assets for further information. 

Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets 

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is generally considered to have been surrendered when: (i) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; (ii) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a trivial benefit to the Company; and (iii) the Company does not maintain the obligation or unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets. 

The Company sells financial assets in the normal course of business, the majority of which are residential mortgage loan sales, primarily to government-sponsored enterprises through established programs, commercial loan sales through participation agreements, and other individual or portfolio loan and securities sales. In accordance with accounting guidance for asset transfers, the Company considers any ongoing involvement with transferred assets in determining whether the assets can be derecognized from the balance sheet. With the exception of servicing and certain performance-based guarantees, the Company&#8217;s continuing involvement with financial assets sold is minimal and generally limited to market customary representation and warranty clauses covering certain characteristics of the mortgage loans sold and the Company's origination process. The gain or loss on sale depends on the previous carrying amount of the transferred financial assets, the consideration received, and any other assets obtained or liabilities incurred in exchange for the transferred assets. 

When the Company sells financial assets, it may retain servicing rights and/or other interests in the financial assets. Servicing assets and any other interests held by the Company are recorded at fair value upon transfer, and thereafter are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Refer to Note 5: Transfers of Financial Assets for further information. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and leases are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of amounts charged off, unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and deferred loan and lease fees or costs which are recognized as yield adjustments using the effective interest method. These yield adjustments are amortized over the contractual life of the related loans and leases adjusted for prepayments when applicable. Interest on loans and leases is credited to interest income as earned based on the interest rate applied to principal amounts outstanding. Prepayment fees are recognized in non-interest income. Cash flows from loans and leases are presented as investing cash flows. 

Non-accrual Loans 

Loans and leases are placed on non-accrual status when collection of principal and interest in accordance with contractual terms is doubtful, generally when principal or interest payments become 90 days delinquent, unless the loan or lease is well secured and in process of collection, or sooner if management concludes circumstances indicate that the borrower may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest payments. Residential real estate loans, excluding loans fully insured against loss and in the process of collection, and consumer loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, or at the date when the Company is notified that the borrower is discharged in bankruptcy. Residential loans that are more than 90 days past due, fully insured against loss, and in the process of collection, remain accruing and are reported as 90 days or more past due and accruing. Commercial, commercial real estate loans, and equipment finance loans or leases are subject to a detailed review when 90 days past due to determine accrual status, or when payment is uncertain and a specific consideration is made to put a loan or lease on non-accrual status. 

When loans and leases are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued, and any unpaid accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income. If ultimate repayment of a non-accrual loan or lease is expected, any payments received are applied in accordance with contractual terms. If ultimate repayment is not expected on commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment finance loans and leases, any payment received on a non-accrual loan or lease is applied to principal until the unpaid balance has been fully recovered. Any excess is then credited to interest income when received. If the Company determines, through a current valuation analysis, that principal can be repaid on residential real estate and consumer loans, interest payments may be taken into income as received on a cash basis. 

Loans are generally removed from non-accrual status when they become current as to principal and interest or demonstrate a period of performance under contractual terms and, in the opinion of management, are fully collectible as to principal and interest. Pursuant to regulatory guidance, a loan discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code is removed from non-accrual status when the bank expects full repayment of the remaining pre-discharged contractual principal and interest, and had at least six consecutive months of current payments. Refer to Note 4: Loans and Leases for further information. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

ALLL is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and represents management&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The ALLL consists of three elements: (i) specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on impaired loans and leases; (ii) quantitative valuation allowances calculated using loss experience for like loans and leases with similar characteristics and trends, adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the impact of current conditions; and (iii) qualitative factors determined based on general economic conditions and other factors that may be internal or external to the Company. The reserve level reflects management&#8217;s view of trends in losses, current portfolio quality, and present economic, political, and regulatory conditions. The ALLL may be allocated for specific portfolio segments; however, the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio. A charge-off is recorded when all or a portion of the loan or lease is deemed to be uncollectible. While management utilizes its best judgment based on the information available at the time, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, which include the performance of the Company&#8217;s portfolio, economic conditions, interest rate sensitivity, and other external factors. 

The process for estimating probable losses is based on predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan and lease portfolio and combines the measurement with other quantitative and qualitative factors. To measure credit risk for the commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing portfolios, the Company employs a dual grade credit risk grading system for estimating the PD and the LGD. The credit risk grade system assigns a rating to each borrower and to the facility, which together form a Composite Credit Risk Profile. The credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics. The Composite Credit Risk Profile has ten grades, with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss. Grades (1) - (6) are considered pass ratings, and (7) - (10) are considered criticized as defined by the regulatory agencies. Risk ratings, assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio, are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrowers&#8217; current financial position and outlook, risk profile, and the related collateral and structural position. Loan officers review updated financial information or other loan factors on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade. Criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring. A (7) "Special Mention" asset has the potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset. An (8) "Substandard" asset has a well defined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt. An asset rated (9) "Doubtful" has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard credit with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, given current facts, conditions, and values, improbable. Assets classified as (10) "Loss" in accordance with regulatory guidelines are considered uncollectible and charged off. 

For residential and consumer loans, the Company considers factors such as past due status, updated FICO scores, employment status, collateral, geography, loans discharged in bankruptcy, and the status of first lien position loans on second lien position loans as credit quality indicators. On an ongoing basis for portfolio monitoring purposes, the Company estimates the current value of property secured as collateral for home equity and residential first mortgage lending products. The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by the S&#38;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. The real estate price data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. Back-testing is performed to compare original estimated losses and actual observed losses, resulting in ongoing refinements. The balance resulting from this process together with specific valuation allowances determines the overall reserve level. 

Charge-offs of Uncollectible Loans 

Any loan may be charged-off if a loss confirming event has occurred. Loss confirming events usually involve the receipt of specific adverse information about the borrower and may include bankruptcy (unsecured), foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a shortfall between the value of the collateral and the book value of the loan when that collateral asset is the sole source of repayment. The Company generally charges-off commercial loans when it is determined that the specific loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible. This determination is based on facts and circumstances of the individual loans and normally includes considering the viability of the related business, the value of any collateral, the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform and the overall financial condition of the borrower. The Company generally charges-off residential real estate loans to the estimated fair value of their collateral, net of selling costs, when they become 180 days past due. 

Impaired Loans 

Loans and leases are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. Impairment is evaluated on a pooled basis for smaller-balance homogeneous residential, consumer loans and small business loans. Commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing loans and leases over a specific dollar amount and all TDRs are evaluated individually for impairment. A loan identified as a TDR is considered an impaired loan for its entire term, with few exceptions. If a loan is impaired, a specific valuation allowance may be established, and the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan&#8217;s original interest rate or at the fair value of collateral less cost to sell if repayment is expected from collateral liquidation. Interest payments on non-accruing impaired loans are typically applied to principal unless collectability of the principal amount is reasonably assured, in which case interest is recognized on a cash basis. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, discharged bankruptcy, and the likelihood of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments. Refer to Note 4: Loans and Leases for further information. 

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments provides for probable losses inherent with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend. The unfunded reserve calculation includes factors that are consistent with the ALLL methodology for funded loans using the PD, LGD, and a draw down factor applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments is included within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and changes in the reserve are reported as a component of other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 22: Commitments and Contingencies for further information. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A modified loan is considered a TDR when the following two conditions are met: (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty; and (ii) the modification constitutes a concession. The Company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted, including the borrower's ability to access funds at a market rate. In general, a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms. Modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower. The most common types of modifications include covenant modifications and forbearance. Loans for which the borrower has been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent TDR, impaired at the date of discharge, and charged down to the fair value of collateral less cost to sell, if management considers that loss potential likely exists. 

The Company&#8217;s policy is to place consumer loan TDRs, except those that were performing prior to TDR status, on non-accrual status for a minimum period of six months. Commercial TDR are evaluated on a case-by-case basis for determination of whether or not to place them on non-accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Initially, all TDRs are reported as impaired. Generally, TDRs are classified as impaired loans and reported as TDR for the remaining life of the loan. Impaired and TDR classification may be removed if the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum of six months and through a fiscal year-end and the restructuring agreement specifies a market rate of interest equal to that which would be provided to a borrower with similar credit at the time of restructuring. In the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from TDR classification, it is the Company&#8217;s policy to continue to base its measure of loan impairment on the contractual terms specified by the loan agreement. Refer to Note 4: Loans and Leases for further information. 

Foreclosed and Repossessed Assets 

Real estate acquired through foreclosure or completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and other assets acquired through repossession are recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of transfer. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the foreclosed and repossessed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and are included within other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Independent appraisals generally are obtained to substantiate fair value and may be subject to adjustment based upon historical experience or specific geographic trends impacting the property. Upon transfer to OREO the excess of loan balance over fair value less cost to sell is charged off against the ALLL. Subsequent write-downs in value, maintenance costs as incurred, and gains or losses upon sale are charged to non-interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: 

##TABLE_START Minimum Maximum Building and Improvements 5 - &#160; 40 years Leasehold improvements 5 - &#160; 20 years (or lease term, if shorter) Fixtures and equipment 5 - &#160; 10 years Data processing and software 3 - &#160; 7 years ##TABLE_END

Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to non-interest expense as incurred. Property and equipment that is actively marketed for sale is reclassified to assets held for disposition. The cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization relating to property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated, and any resulting losses are charged to non-interest expense. Refer to Note 6: Premises and Equipment for further information. 

Leasing 

A right-of-use (ROU) asset and corresponding lease liability is recognized at the lease commencement date when the Company is a lessee. ROU lease assets are included in premises and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. A ROU asset reflects the present value of the future minimum lease payments adjusted for any initial direct costs, incentives, or other payments prior to the lease commencement date. A lease liability represents a legal obligation to make lease payments and is determined by the present value of the future minimum lease payments discounted using the rate implicit in the lease, or the Company&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index, or rate, are initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date and are included in the measurement of the lease liability. Renewal options are not included as part of the ROU asset or lease liability unless the option is deemed reasonably certain to exercise. 

For real estate leases, lease components and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component. For equipment leases, lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Operating lease expense is comprised of operating lease costs and variable lease costs, net of sublease income, and is reflected as part of occupancy within non-interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. Refer to Note 7: Leasing for further information. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is assigned to specific reporting units. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but rather is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating it would more likely than not result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 

Goodwill may be evaluated for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then a quantitative process will be performed that requires the Company to utilize an equally weighted combined income and market approach to arrive at an indicated fair value range for the reporting unit. In Step 1, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to ascertain if a goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and it is not necessary to continue to Step 2 of the impairment process. Otherwise, Step 2 is performed where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit. If a reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeds fair value of goodwill, the difference is charged to non-interest expense. 

The Company completed a qualitative assessment for its reporting units during its most recent annual impairment review to determine if the quantitative impairment test was necessary. Based on its qualitative assessment, the Company determined that there was no evidence of impairment to the balance of its goodwill. Refer to Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 

Other Intangible Assets 

Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights, or because it is capable of being sold or exchanged either separately or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives, such as core deposits and customer relationships, are amortized to non-interest expense over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances change indicating the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance 

Investment in life insurance represents the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain current and former employees of Webster. Cash surrender value increases are recorded in non-interest income, decreases are the result of collection on the policies, with death benefit proceeds in excess of cash surrender value recorded in other non-interest income upon the death of an insured. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 

These agreements are accounted for as secured financing transactions since Webster maintains effective control over the transferred investment securities and the transfer meets the other criteria for such accounting. Obligations to repurchase the sold investment securities are reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The investment securities sold, with agreement to repurchase, to wholesale dealers are transferred to a custodial account for the benefit of the dealer or bank with whom each transaction is executed. The dealers or banks may sell, loan, or otherwise hypothecate such securities to other parties in the normal course of their operations and agree to resell to Webster the same securities at the maturity date of the agreements. Webster also enters into repurchase agreements with Bank customers. The investment securities sold with agreement to repurchase to Bank customers are not transferred but internally pledged to the repurchase agreement transaction. Refer to Note 11: Borrowings for further information. 

Revenue From Contracts With Customers 

Revenue from contracts with customers generally comprises non-interest income earned by the Company in exchange for services provided to customers and is recognized when services are complete or as they are rendered. These revenue streams include deposit service fees, wealth and investment services, and an insignificant component of other non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. The Company identifies the performance obligations included in the contracts with customers, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations, as applicable, and recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. Services provided over a period of time are typically transferred to customers evenly over the term of the contracts and revenue is recognized evenly over the period services are provided. Contract receivables are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets. Payment terms vary by services offered, and the time between completion of performance obligations and payment is typically not significant. Refer to Note 21: Revenue from Contracts with Customers for further information. 

Share-Based Compensation 

Webster maintains stock compensation plans under which restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and directors. Share awards are issued from available treasury shares. Share-based compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period, is based on the grant-date fair value, net of a reduction for estimated forfeitures which is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur, and is reported as a component of compensation and benefits expense. Awards are generally subject to a 3-year vesting period, while certain conditions provide for a 1-year vesting period. Excess tax benefit or tax deficiency results when tax return deductions differ from recognized compensation cost determined using the grant-date fair value approach for financial statement purposes. 

For restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, fair value is measured using the Company's common stock closing price at the date of grant. For certain performance-based restricted stock awards, fair value is measured using the Monte Carlo valuation methodology, which provides for the 3-year performance period. Awards ultimately vest in a range from zero to 150 % of the target number of shares under the grant. Compensation expense is subject to adjustment based on management's assessment of Webster's return on equity performance relative to the target number of shares condition. Stock option awards use the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model to measure fair value at the date of grant. Dividends are paid on the time-based shares upon grant and are non-forfeitable, while dividends are accrued on the performance-based awards and paid on vested shares when the performance target is met. Refer to Note 19: Share-Based Plans for further information. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense, or benefit, is comprised of two components, current and deferred. The current component reflects taxes payable or refundable for a current period based on applicable tax laws, and the deferred component represents the tax effects of temporary differences between amounts recognized for financial accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effects of such differences that are anticipated to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future, when the temporary differences reverse. DTAs are recognized if it is more likely than not they will be realized, and may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion will not be realized. 

Tax positions that are uncertain but meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management's judgment. Webster recognizes interest expense and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense and recognizes interest income on refundable income taxes as a component of other non-interest income. Refer to Note 9: Income Taxes for further information. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Earnings per common share is presented under the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, excluding outstanding participating securities. Certain unvested restricted stock awards are participating securities as they have non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares determined for the basic earnings per common share computation plus the dilutive effect of stock compensation and warrants for common stock using the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of the weighted-average shares used in calculating basic earnings per common share and the weighted-average common shares used in calculating diluted earnings per common share is provided in Note 15: Earnings Per Common Share. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income includes all changes in shareholders&#8217; equity during a period, except those resulting from transactions with shareholders. Comprehensive income consists of net income, and the after-tax effect of the following items: changes in net unrealized gain/loss on securities available for sale, changes in net unrealized gain/loss on derivative instruments, and changes in net actuarial gain/loss and prior service cost for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Comprehensive income is reported in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and Note 13: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

Derivatives are recognized at fair value, with exchange-traded contracts based on quoted market prices while non-exchange traded contracts are based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require management judgment or estimation, relating to future rates and credit activities. Derivatives are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets and in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated cash flow statement. 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships. The Company uses derivatives to hedge exposures, or to modify interest rate characteristics, for certain balance sheet accounts under its interest rate risk management strategy. The Company designates derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Derivative financial instruments receive hedge accounting treatment if they are qualified and properly designated as a hedge and remain highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the hedge. Quarterly prospective and retrospective assessments are performed to ensure hedging relationships continue to be highly effective. If a hedge relationship were no longer highly effective, hedge accounting would be discontinued. 

The change in fair value on a derivative designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged, is recognized in earnings in the same accounting period. The gain or loss on a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially recorded as a component of AOCL and subsequently reclassified to interest income as hedged interest payments are received or to interest expense as hedged interest payments are made in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships . The Company also enters into derivative transactions which are not designated in a hedge relationship. Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedge relationship are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other non-interest income on the consolidated statement of income. 

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . The Company presents derivative assets and derivative liabilities with the same counterparty and the related variation margin of cash collateral are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet. Cash collateral relating to the initial margin is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Securities collateral is not offset. The Company clears all dealer eligible contracts through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and has elected to record non-cleared derivative positions subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement on a net basis. 

Refer to Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments for further information. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company measures many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, " Fair Value Measurement. " Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Examples of these include derivative instruments, available-for-sale securities and loans held for sale where the Company has elected the fair value option. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment. Examples of these include impaired loans and leases, mortgage servicing assets, long-lived assets, goodwill, and loans not originated for sale but subsequently transferred to held for sale, which are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. Further information regarding the Company's policies and methodology used to measure fair value is presented in Note 17: Fair Value Measurements. 

Employee Retirement Benefit Plan 

Webster Bank maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering all employees that were participants on or before December 31, 2007. Costs related to this qualified plan, based upon actuarial computations of current and future benefits for eligible employees, are charged to non-interest expense and are funded in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The plan is recorded as an asset if over-funded or a liability if under-funded. There is a supplemental retirement plan for select executive level employees that were participants on or before December 31, 2007. There is also a postretirement healthcare benefits plan for certain retired employees. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates 

Effective January 1, 2019, the following new accounting guidance was adopted by the Company: 

ASU No. 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes. 

The Update permits the use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct U.S. Treasury obligations, the London Interbank Offered Rate swap rate, the OIS rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Rate. 

The Company adopted the Update during the first quarter of 2019 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. 

The purpose of the Update is to better align a company&#8217;s risk management and financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The Update expands an entity's ability to hedge non-financial and financial risk components and reduce complexity in hedges of interest rate risk. The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, and generally requires the entire change in fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. 

The Company adopted the Update during the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company has provided enhanced disclosures in Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments as a result of adopting this Update. 

ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and subsequent ASUs issued to amend this Topic. 

The Updates introduce a lessee model that requires substantially all leases to be recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. The lessor model remains substantially the same with targeted improvements that do not materially impact the Company. 

The Company adopted the Updates during the first quarter of 2019 using the new transition method option that allows the use of effective date, January 1, 2019, as the date of initial application of the new lease accounting standard and to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption. The Company elected the transition relief package of practical expedients which forgoes the requirement to reassess the existence of leases in existing contracts, their lease classification and the accounting treatment of their initial direct costs. As a practical expedient, the Company has also made a policy election to not separate non-lease components from lease components for its real estate leases and instead account for each separate lease components and non-lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. The Company will separately account for the lease and non-lease components in its equipment leases. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease based on whether a contract, or a part of a contract, conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The discount rate used is either the rate implicit in the lease, or when a rate cannot be readily determined an incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment. 

As a result of adopting this Update, the Company recognized $ 157.2 million of right-of-use asset (ROU) and $ 178.8 million of lease liability, as of January 1, 2019. The Company also recorded a $ 513 thousand cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 for abandoned leased properties and the remaining deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions which occurred prior to the date of adoption. Refer to Note 7: Leasing for further information. 

Accounting Standards Issued but not yet Adopted 

The following list identifies ASUs applicable to the Company that have been issued by the FASB but are pending adoption: 

ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. 

The Update provides simplifications to the accounting for income taxes related to a variety of topics and makes minor codification improvements. Changes include a requirement that the effects of an enacted change in tax law be reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the new legislation. 

The Update will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2021. The Company does not expect this Update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. 

The Update amends guidance on credit losses, hedge accounting, and recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The changes provide clarifications and codification improvements in relation to recently issued accounting updates. The amendments to the guidance on credit losses are considered in the paragraphs below related to our adoption of ASU 2016-13, and will be adopted concurrently with those Updates. 

The Update became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. 

The Update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The updated guidance also requires an entity to amortize the capitalized implementation costs as an expense over the term of the hosting arrangement and to present in the same income statement line item as the fees associated with the hosting arrangement. 

The Update became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company will apply the amendments in this update prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plan - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. 

The Update modifies disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. 

The Update will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2021. The Company does not expect this Update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. 

The Update modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The updated guidance will no longer require entities to disclose the amount and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, it will require public companies to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 measurements. 

The Update became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. 

The Update simplifies quantitative goodwill impairment testing by requiring entities to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, up to but not exceeding the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

The Update changes current guidance by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination upon acquisition. Entities will still have the option to first perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. 

The Update must be applied prospectively and became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and subsequent ASUs issued to clarify this Topic. 

The Updates will replace the existing incurred loss approach for recognizing credit losses with a new credit loss methodology known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The CECL methodology requires earlier recognition of credit losses using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach for financial assets carried at amortized cost. The CECL methodology also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates. 

To implement the new standard, the Company established a project lead and empowered a steering committee comprised of members from different disciplines including Credit, Accounting, Finance, Financial Analytics, Information Technology, and Treasury, as well as specific working groups focused on key components of the development process. Through the working groups, the Company evaluated the effect that the Updates have on its financial statements and related disclosures. The CECL credit models incorporate assumptions used to calculate credit losses over the estimated life of the applicable financial assets and include the impact of forecasted macroeconomic conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company continued testing CECL credit models, processes, and controls in parallel with the existing incurred loss approach. The Company is continuing to work on finalizing CECL accounting policies and drafting required disclosures under these Updates. 

Adopting the new standard required the Company to make certain policy elections and decisions on how expected losses are measured. Under CECL, the Company will estimate lifetime credit losses based on three portfolio segments: commercial loans and leases, consumer loans and lines of credit, and HTM debt securities. Expected losses within the commercial and consumer portfolio segments will be collectively assessed using PD/LGD models. Expected losses on HTM debt securities will be collectively assessed with separate models for each type of security. Through the Company&#8217;s established CECL Committee, policy elections, key assumptions, processes, and models will be reviewed and updated as necessary. 

These Updates became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, at which time the CECL processes, controls, and models became the Company&#8217;s primary method for calculating and recording the allowance for credit losses. The Company will adopt the Updates using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption of the Updates the Company expects an increase of approximately 30% in its allowance for credit losses, reflected as a reduction, net of tax, to the Company's beginning total shareholders' equity at January 1, 2020. Upon adoption the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses became reflective of all credit losses expected over the lifetime of the Company&#8217;s applicable financial assets. The allowance for credit losses will be based on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as of the reporting date and will include consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at that date. The entire increase in the allowance for credit losses will be reflected in the Company's regulatory capital ratios and will not have a significant impact. 

Note 2: Variable Interest Entities 

The Company has an investment interest in the following entities that meet the definition of a VIE. 

Consolidated 

Rabbi Trust. The Company established a Rabbi Trust to meet the obligations due under its Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned plan. The funding of the Rabbi Trust and the discontinuation of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers occurred during 2012. 

Investments held in the Rabbi Trust primarily consist of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the Rabbi Trust as it has the power to direct the activities of the Rabbi Trust that significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The Company consolidates the invested assets of the trust along with the total deferred compensation obligations and includes them in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. Earnings in the Rabbi Trust, including appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as other non-interest income, and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as compensation and benefits, in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 17: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 

Non-Consolidated 

Tax Credit - Finance Investments. The Company makes non-marketable equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects and provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits. In most instances the investments require the funding of capital commitments in the future. While the Company's investment in an entity may exceed 50% of its outstanding equity interests, the entity is not consolidated as the Company is not involved in its management. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's tax credit-finance investments was $ 42.5 million and $ 29.1 million, respectively, which represents the Company's maximum exposure to loss. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, unfunded commitments have been recognized, totaling $ 15.1 million and $ 10.4 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Webster Statutory Trust. The Company owns all the outstanding common stock of Webster Statutory Trust, a financial vehicle that has issued, and in the future may issue, trust preferred securities. The trust is a VIE in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The trust's only assets are junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company, which were acquired by the trust using the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common stock. The junior subordinated debentures are included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets, and the related interest expense is reported as interest expense on long-term debt in the consolidated statement of income. 

Other Non-Marketable Investments. The Company invests in various alternative investments in which it holds a variable interest. These investments are non-public entities which cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. For these investments, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. 

At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's other non-marketable investments in VIEs was $ 21.8 million and $ 17.6 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss of the Company's other non-marketable investments in VIEs, including unfunded commitments, was $ 64.2 million and $ 31.0 million, respectively. Refer to Note 17: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. 

The Company's equity interests in Other Non-Marketable Investments, as well as Tax Credit-Finance Investments and Webster Statutory Trust, are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. For a description of the Company's accounting policy regarding the consolidation of VIEs, refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the section &#8220;Principles of Consolidation&#8221;.

Impairment Analysis 

The following impairment analysis summarizes the basis for evaluating if investment securities within the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios are other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019. Unless otherwise noted for an investment security type, management does not intend to sell these investment securities and has determined, based upon available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investment securities before the recovery of their amortized cost. As such, based on the following impairment analysis, the Company does not consider any of these investment securities, in unrealized loss positions, to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2019.

For the maturity schedule above, mortgage-backed securities and CLO, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been categorized based on the maturity date of the underlying collateral.

At December 31, 2019, the Company had a carrying value of $ 1.3 billion in callable debt securities in its CMBS, CLO, and municipal bond portfolios. The Company considers prepayment risk in the evaluation of its interest rate risk profile. These maturities may not reflect actual durations, which may be impacted by prepayments. 

Investment securities with a carrying value totaling $ 2.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 2.2 billion at December 31, 2018 were pledged to secure public funds, trust deposits, repurchase agreements, and for other purposes, as required or permitted by law.

Note 5: Transfers of Financial Assets 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

The Company sells financial assets in the normal course of business, primarily residential mortgage loans sold to government-sponsored enterprises through established programs and securitization. Residential mortgage origination fees, adjustments for changes in fair value, and gain or loss on loans sold are included as mortgage banking activities in the consolidated statement of income. 

The Company may be required to repurchase a loan in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties, or in the event of default of the borrower within 90 days of sale, as provided for in the sale agreements. A reserve for loan repurchases provides for estimated losses pertaining to the potential repurchase of loans associated with the Company's mortgage banking activities. The reserve reflects loan repurchase requests received by the Company for which management evaluates the identity of counterparty, the vintage of the loans sold, the amount of open repurchase requests, specific loss estimates for each open request, the current level of loan losses in similar vintages held in the residential loan portfolio, and estimated recoveries on the underlying collateral. The reserve also reflects management&#8217;s expectation of losses from loan repurchase requests for which the Company has not yet been notified. The provision recorded at the time of the loan sale is netted from the gain or loss recorded in mortgage banking activities, while any incremental provision, post loan sale, is recorded in other non-interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. 

The following table provides a summary of activity in the reserve for loan repurchases:

Included in the Company's income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, are net tax credits of $ 4.8 million, $ 1.2 million, and $ 1.6 million, respectively. Income tax expense in 2017 also included benefits from operating loss carryforwards of $ 25.1 million. These net tax credits and benefits are exclusive of the Tax Act impacts. 

The $ 4.8 million of net tax credits in 2019 includes $ 3.0 million, related to federal and state research tax credits, $ 2.4 million of which relates to the Company&#8217;s qualifying technology expenditures incurred between 2015 and 2018. 

The Company's deferred state and local benefit in 2017 includes $ 47.5 million related to a reduction in its beginning-of-year valuation allowance for SALT DTA's, or $ 37.5 million net of deferred federal expense of $ 10.0 million. The deferred state and local benefit in 2017 also includes $ 1.8 million from other SALT DTA adjustments, net of federal effects. 

The Company's deferred federal expense in 2017 also includes $ 31.5 million from a re-measurement of its DTA upon the enactment of the Tax Act. Due to a $ 10.6 million impact of the Tax Act on the $ 39.3 million of net SALT DTA adjustments noted above, the Company reported a $ 20.9 million expense attributable to the Tax Act, and a $ 28.7 million net benefit from SALT DTAs in 2017.

The Company's DTAs, net decreased by $ 34.5 million during 2019, reflecting the $ 0.9 million deferred tax expense and a $ 33.6 million benefit allocated directly to shareholders' equity. 

The $ 38.2 million valuation allowance at December 31, 2019 is attributable to SALT net operating loss carryforwards, which approximated $ 1.2 billion. 

SALT net operating loss carryforwards approximated $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and are scheduled to expire in varying amounts during tax years 2024 through 2032. The valuation allowance has been established for approximately $ 644.4 million of those net operating loss carryforwards estimated to expire unused. Credit carryovers of $ 0.7 million, net at December 31, 2019 have a five-year carryover period and are scheduled to expire in varying amounts during tax years 2020 through 2024. 

Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its total DTAs, net of the valuation allowance. Although taxable income in prior years is no longer able to be included as a source of taxable income, due to the general repeal of the carryback of net operating losses under the Tax Act, significant positive evidence remains in support of management's conclusion regarding the realizability of Webster's DTAs, including projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and book-taxable income levels in recent and projected in future years. There can, however, be no assurance that any specific level of future income will be generated or that the Company&#8217;s DTAs will ultimately be realized. 

A deferred tax liability of $ 15.3 million has not been recognized for certain thrift bad-debt reserves, established before 1988, that would become taxable upon the occurrence of certain events: distributions by Webster Bank in excess of certain earnings and profits; the redemption of Webster Bank&#8217;s stock; or liquidation. Webster does not expect any of those events to occur. At December 31, 2019 the cumulative taxable temporary differences applicable to those reserves approximated $ 58.0 million. 

The following table reflects a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs):

At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were $ 3.9 million, $ 2.3 million, and $ 2.8 million, respectively, of UTBs that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. 

Webster recognizes interest and penalties related to UTBs, where applicable, in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, Webster recognized a benefit of $ 0.1 million, none , and an expense of $ 0.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to UTBs of $ 1.8 million. 

Webster has determined it is reasonably possible that its total UTBs could decrease by an amount in the range of $ 1.9 million to $ 2.7 million by the end of 2020 as a result of potential lapses in statute-of-limitation periods and/or potential settlements with state and local taxing authorities concerning apportionment and tax-base determinations. 

Webster's federal tax returns for all years subsequent to 2014 remain open to examination. Webster's tax returns to its principal state tax jurisdictions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island for years subsequent to 2014 are either under or remain open to examination.

Common Stock 

Webster maintains a common stock repurchase program which authorizes management to purchase shares of its common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. On October 29, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a modification to this program, originally approved on October 24, 2017, increasing the maximum dollar amount available for repurchase to $ 200 million. Common stock repurchased during 2019 was acquired at an average cost of $ 57.23 per common share. The shares were acquired prior to the modification and, therefore, the remaining repurchase authority under the common stock repurchase program was $ 200.0 million at December 31, 2019. 

Preferred Stock 

Webster has 6,000,000 depository shares outstanding, each representing 1/1000th ownership interest in a share of Webster's 5.25 % Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $ 25,000 per share (equivalent to $ 25 per depository share) (the Series F Preferred Stock). Webster will pay dividends as declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board. Dividends are payable at a rate of 5.25 % per annum, quarterly in arrears, on the fifteenth day of each March, June, September, and December. Dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock are not cumulative and are not mandatory. If for any reason the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board does not declare a dividend on the Series F Preferred Stock for any dividend period, such dividend will not accrue or be payable, and Webster will have no obligation to pay dividends for such dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend periods. The terms of the Series F Preferred Stock prohibit the Company from declaring or paying any cash dividends on its common stock, unless Webster has declared and paid full dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. 

The Company may redeem the Series F Preferred Stock, at its option in whole or in part, on December 15, 2022, or any dividend payment date thereafter, or in whole but not in part upon a "regulatory capital treatment event" as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series F Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights except with respect to authorizing or increasing the authorized amount of senior stock, certain changes to the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock, or in the case of certain dividend non-payments.

Note 14: Regulatory Matters 

Capital Requirements 

Webster Financial Corporation is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve System, while Webster Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC. Regulatory authorities can initiate certain mandatory actions if Webster Financial Corporation or Webster Bank fail to meet minimum capital requirements, which could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. These quantitative measures require minimum amounts and ratios to ensure capital adequacy. 

Basel III, total risk-based capital is comprised of three categories: CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital includes common shareholders' equity, less deductions for goodwill, other intangibles, and certain deferred tax adjustments. Common shareholders' equity, for purposes of CET1 capital, excludes AOCL components as permitted by the opt-out election taken by Webster upon adoption of Basel III. Tier 1 capital is comprised of CET1 capital plus perpetual preferred stock, while Tier 2 capital includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses, that together equal total capital. 

The following table provides information on the capital ratios for Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank:

Dividend Restrictions 

Webster Financial Corporation is dependent upon dividends from Webster Bank to provide funds for its cash requirements, including payments of dividends to shareholders. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid. Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of Webster Bank to fall below specified minimum levels, or if dividends declared exceed the net income for that year combined with the undistributed net income for the preceding two years. Dividends paid by Webster Bank to Webster Financial Corporation totaled $ 360 million and $ 290 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Cash Restrictions 

Webster Bank is required by Federal Reserve System regulations to hold cash reserve balances, on hand or with Federal Reserve Banks. Pursuant to this requirement, the Bank held $ 93.8 million and $ 81.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Reconciliation of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share follows:

(1) Earnings per common share amounts under the two-class method, for nonvested time-based restricted shares with nonforfeitable dividends and dividend rights, are determined the same as the presentation above. 

Dilutive Securities 

The Company maintains stock compensation plans under which restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and directors. The effect of dilutive securities for the periods presented is primarily the result of outstanding stock options, as well as non-participating restricted stock. 

Potential common shares from non-participating restricted stock of $ 73 thousand, $ 47 thousand, and $ 58 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, are excluded from the effect of dilutive securities because they would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. 

Refer to Note 12: Shareholders' Equity and Note 19: Share-Based Plans for further information relating to potential common shares excluded from the effect of dilutive securities. 

Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative Positions and Offsetting 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to change the fixed or variable nature of an interest rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Certain pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges to convert floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt, while certain receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges to convert fixed-rate long-term debt into a variable-rate obligation. Certain purchased options are designated as cash flow hedges. Purchased options allow the Company to limit the potential adverse impact of variable interest rates by establishing a cap or a floor strike rate in exchange for an upfront premium. The purchased options designated as cash flow hedges represent interest rate caps where payment is received from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the contractual strike rate and interest rate floors where payment is received from the counterparty when interest rates fall below the contractual strike rate. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships . The Company also enters into other derivative transactions to manage economic risks but does not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Further, the Company enters into derivative contracts to accommodate customer needs. Derivative contracts with customers are offset with dealer counterparty transactions structured with matching terms to ensure minimal impact on earnings. 

The following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of derivative positions:

(1) Balances related to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are presented as a single unit of account. In accordance with its rule book, CME legally characterizes variation margin payments as settlement of derivatives rather than collateral against derivative positions. Notional amounts of interest rate swaps cleared through CME include $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.9 billion for asset derivatives and $ 2.6 billion and $ 1.1 billion for liability derivatives at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The related fair values approximate zero. 

(2) The increase in the notional amount is for $ 1.0 billion of interest rate floors purchased due to balance sheet management activities. 

(3) Notional amounts related to residential loan commitments include mandatory forward commitments of $ 57.0 million, while notional amounts do not include approved floating rate commitments of $ 7.3 million, at December 31, 2019. 

(4) Other derivatives include foreign currency forward contracts related to lending arrangements and customer hedging activity, a Visa equity swap transaction, and risk participation agreements. Notional amounts of risk participation agreements include $ 65.7 million and $ 65.0 million for asset derivatives and $ 223.4 million and $ 96.3 million for liability derivatives at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, that have insignificant related fair values.

Purchased options designated as cash flow hedges exclude time-value premiums from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Time-value premiums are amortized on a straight-line basis. During 2019, $ 1.3 million was amortized to net interest income. At December 31, 2019, the remaining unamortized balance of time-value premiums was $ 12.1 million. 

Over the next twelve months, an estimated $ 4.8 million reduction to interest expense will be reclassified from AOCL relating to cash flow hedges, and an estimated $ 2.3 million increase to interest expense will be reclassified from AOCL relating to hedge terminations. At December 31, 2019, the remaining unamortized loss on terminated cash flow hedges is $ 4.9 million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10 years. 

Additional information about cash flow hedge activity impacting AOCL and the related amounts reclassified to earnings is provided in Note 13: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax. Information about the valuation methods used to measure the fair value of derivatives is provided in Note 17: Fair Value Measurements. 

Derivative Exposure 

Webster reviews collateral positions on a daily basis and exchanges collateral with counterparties in accordance with standard ISDA documentation, Dodd-Frank requirements, central clearing rules, and other related agreements. The Company had approximately $ 121.6 million in net margin posted with financial counterparties or the derivative clearing organization at December 31, 2019, which is primarily comprised of $ 56.6 million in initial margin collateral posted at CME and $ 71.3 million in CME variation margin posted. At December 31, 2019, $ 8.4 million of cash collateral received is included in cash and due from banks on the consolidated balance sheet and is considered restricted in nature. 

Webster regularly evaluates the credit risk of its derivative customers, taking into account the likelihood of default, net exposures, and remaining contractual life, among other related factors. Credit risk exposure is mitigated as transactions with customers are generally secured by the same collateral of the underlying transactions being hedged. Current net credit exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers was $ 132.3 million at December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company monitors potential future exposure, representing its best estimate of exposure to remaining contractual maturity. The potential future exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers totaled $ 39.6 million at December 31, 2019.

Note 17: Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined using quoted market prices. However, in many instances, quoted market prices are not available. In such instances, fair values are determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques. Accordingly, categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate transfer of the respective asset or liability. 

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings or any part of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These factors are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1: Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

&#8226; Level 2: Fair value is calculated using significant inputs other than quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. The valuation may rely on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, rate volatility, prepayment speeds, credit ratings,) or inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by market data, by correlation, or other means. 

&#8226; Level 3: Inputs for determining the fair value of the respective assets or liabilities are not observable. Level 3 valuations are reliant upon pricing models and techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Available-for-Sale Investment Securities . When quoted prices are available in an active market, the Company classifies available-for-sale investment securities within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. Treasury Bills are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations, or methodologies, that appear unusual or unexpected. Available-for-Sale investment securities which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, CLO, and corporate debt, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative Instruments . Foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

All other derivative instruments are valued using third-party valuation software, which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions. The resulting fair value is validated against valuations performed by independent third parties and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Webster evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties to determine if any fair value adjustment related to credit risk may be required, by considering factors such as the likelihood of default by the counterparty, its net exposure, remaining contractual life, as well as the collateral securing the position. The change in value of derivative assets and liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during the reported periods. 

Mortgage Banking Derivatives . Forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are utilized by the Company in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Prior to closing and funding certain single-family residential mortgage loans, an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower. During the period from commitment date to closing date, the Company is subject to the risk that market rates of interest may change. If market rates rise, investors generally will pay less to purchase such loans resulting in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or, possibly, a loss. In an effort to mitigate such risk, forward delivery sales commitments are established, under which the Company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgage-backed securities. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and, therefore, classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Originated Loans Held For Sale . Residential mortgage loans typically are classified as held for sale upon origination based on management's intent to sell such loans. The Company generally records residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option of ASC Topic 825 "Financial Instruments." Electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivatives used as an economic hedge on these assets. The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions. Accordingly, such loans are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table compares the fair value to unpaid principal balance of assets accounted for under the fair value option:

Investments Held in Rabbi Trust. Investments held in the Rabbi Trust primarily include mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. Shares of mutual funds are valued based on net asset value, which represents quoted market prices for the underlying shares held in the mutual funds. Therefore, investments held in the Rabbi Trust are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has elected to measure the investments held in the Rabbi Trust at fair value. The cost basis of the investments held in the Rabbi Trust is $ 1.6 million as of December 31, 2019. 

Alternative Investments. Equity investments have a readily determinable fair value when quoted prices are available in an active market. Accordingly, such alternative investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for NAV practical expedient measurement, based on specific requirements. The Company's alternative investments accounted for at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the Company&#8217;s investments are distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Alternative investments recorded at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2019, these alternative investments had a remaining unfunded commitment of $ 23.8 million.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. At December 31, 2019, no significant assets classified within Level 3 were identified and measured under this basis. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured on a non-recurring basis. 

Alternative Investments. The measurement alternative has been elected for alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the NAV practical expedient. The measurement alternative requires investments to be accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. These alternative investments are investments in non-public entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Accordingly, these alternative investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.The carrying amount of these alternative investments was $ 12.6 million at December 31, 2019. No reductions for impairments, or adjustments due to observable price changes, was identified during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Transferred Loans Held For Sale. Certain loans are transferred to loans held for sale once a decision has been made to sell such loans. These loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when they are recorded at below cost. This activity primarily consists of commercial loans with observable inputs and is classified within Level 2. On the occasion that these loans should include adjustments for changes in loan characteristics using unobservable inputs, the loans would be classified within Level 3. 

Impaired Loans and Leases. Impaired loans and leases are reported based on one of three measures: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate; (ii) the loan's observable market price; or (iii) the fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Accordingly, certain impaired loans and leases may be subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan&#8217;s collateral or using a discounted cash flow analysis. Impaired collateral dependent loans and leases are primarily expected to be repaid solely by the underlying collateral and are valued based on the estimated fair value of such collateral using customized discounting criteria. As such, impaired loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets. The total book value of OREO and repossessed assets was $ 6.5 million at December 31, 2019. OREO and repossessed assets are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when recorded below cost. The fair value of OREO is based on independent appraisals or internal valuation methods, less estimated selling costs. The valuation may consider available pricing guides, auction results, and price opinions. Certain assets require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market in the determination of fair value; as such, OREO and repossessed assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Servicing Assets 

The Company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, as well as servicing assets. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities. 

Cash, Due from Banks, and Interest-bearing Deposits . The carrying amount of cash, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits is used to approximate fair value, given the short time frame to maturity and, as such, these assets do not present unanticipated credit concerns. Cash, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities . When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations, or methodologies, that appear unusual or unexpected. Held-to-Maturity investment securities, which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, and municipal bonds and notes, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans and Leases, net . The estimated fair value of loans and leases held for investment is calculated using a discounted cash flow method, using future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity premium for comparable loans and leases. The associated cash flows are adjusted for credit and other potential losses. Fair value for impaired loans and leases is estimated using the net present value of the expected cash flows. Loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Deposit Liabilities . The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Deposit liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Time Deposits . The fair value of a fixed-maturity certificate of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Time deposits are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings . The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings that mature within 90 days is the carrying value. Fair value for all other balances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates adjusted for associated credit risks, as appropriate. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt . The fair value of FHLB advances and long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique. Discount rates are matched with the time period of the expected cash flow and are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect credit risk. FHLB advances and long-term debt are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Assets . Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured under the amortization method. Mortgage servicing assets are subject to impairment testing and thereafter carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Amortization and impairment charges, if any, are included as a component of other non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future net servicing income and relies on market based assumptions for loan prepayment speeds, servicing costs, discount rates, and other economic factors; as such, the primary risk inherent in valuing mortgage servicing assets is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the servicing revenue stream. Mortgage servicing assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Fair value of selected financial instruments and servicing assets amounts are as follows:

Note 18: Retirement Benefit Plans 

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Webster Bank offered a defined benefit noncontributory pension plan through December 31, 2007 for eligible employees who met certain minimum service and age requirements. Pension plan benefits are based upon employee earnings during the period of credited service. A supplemental defined benefit retirement plan (SERP) was also offered to certain employees who were at the Executive Vice President level or above through December 31, 2007. The SERP provides eligible participants with additional pension benefits. Webster Bank also provides postretirement healthcare benefits to certain retired employees. 

The Webster Bank Pension Plan and the SERP were frozen as of December 31, 2007. No additional benefits have been accrued since that time. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 receive no qualified or supplemental retirement income under the plans. All other employees accrue no additional qualified or supplemental retirement benefits after January 1, 2008, and the amount of their qualified and supplemental retirement benefits will not exceed the amount of benefits determined as of December 31, 2007. 

The measurement date is December 31 for the Webster Bank Pension Plan, SERP, and postretirement healthcare benefits. The mortality assumptions used in the pension liability assessment for the year ended December 31, 2019 were the Pri-2012 mortality table projected to measurement date with scale MP-2019.

Fair Value Measurement 

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets and includes the classification of those instruments within the valuation hierarchy: 

Exchange traded fund. The exchange traded fund has quoted market prices on an exchange, in an active market, which represents the net asset value of the shares held in the fund and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value for the exchange traded fund is benchmarked against the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 Index. 

Money market fund. The money market fund is carried at cost, which approximates fair value given the short time frame to maturity for cash and cash equivalents and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Common collective trusts. Common collective trusts hold investments in fixed income and equity funds. Transactions may occur daily within a trust. Should a full redemption of the trust be initiated, the investment advisor reserves the right to temporarily delay withdrawals in order to ensure that the liquidation of securities is carried out in an orderly business manner. A trustee for each common collective trust provides the net asset value of its underlying investments, less its liabilities, which represents the fair value of the trust under the NAV practical expedient. Common collective trusts are benchmarked against the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 Stock Index, the S&#38;P 400 Mid Cap Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the MSCI ACWI ex U.S. Index, and the Barclays Capital U.S. Long Credit Index. 

A summary of the fair value and hierarchy classification of financial assets of the pension plan is as follows:

The Retirement Plan Committee is a fiduciary under ERISA and is charged with the responsibility for directing and monitoring the investment management of the pension plan. To assist the Retirement Plan Committee in this function, it engages the services of investment managers and advisors who possess the necessary expertise to manage the pension plan assets within the established investment policy guidelines and objectives. The investment policy guidelines and objectives are reviewed at a minimum annually by the Retirement Plan Committee. 

The primary objective of the pension plan investment strategy is to provide long-term total return through capital appreciation and dividend and interest income. The Plan invests in registered investment companies and bank collective trusts. The volatility, as measured by standard deviation, of the pension plan assets should not exceed that of the Composite Index. The investment policy guidelines allow the pension plan assets to be invested in certain types of cash equivalents, fixed income securities, equity securities, mutual funds, and collective trusts. Investments in mutual funds and collective trust funds are substantially limited to funds with the securities characteristic of their assigned benchmarks. 

The pension plan investment strategy is designed to maintain a diversified portfolio with a target average long-term rate of 5.75 %, however, there is no certainty that the portfolio will perform to expectations. Asset allocations are monitored monthly and the portfolio is re-balanced when appropriate. 

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:

The assumed healthcare cost-trend rate for 2020 is 6.50 %, declining 0.25% each year thereafter until 2028 when the rate will be 4.60 %. An increase of 1.0% in the assumed healthcare cost-trend rate for 2019 would have increased the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $ 3 thousand and increased the accumulated benefit obligation by $ 97 thousand. A decrease of 1.0% in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for 2019 would have decreased the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $ 3 thousand and decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $ 89 thousand. 

Multiple-Employer Plan 

For the benefit of former employees of a bank acquired by the Company, the Bank is a sponsor of a multiple-employer pension plan that does not segregate the assets or liabilities of its employers participating in the plan. The plan administrator confirmed Webster Bank&#8217;s portion of the plan is under-funded by $ 2.4 million as of July 1, 2019, the date of the latest actuarial valuation. 

The following table sets forth contributions and funding status of Webster Bank's portion of this plan:

Multi-employer accounting is applied to the Fund. As a multiple-employer pension plan, there are no collective bargained contracts affecting its contribution or benefit provisions. Any shortfall amortization basis is being amortized over seven years, as required by the Pension Protection Act. All benefit accruals were frozen as of September 1, 2004. The Company's contributions to this plan did not exceed more than 5% of total contributions in the plan for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. 

Webster Bank Retirement Savings Plan 

Webster Bank provides an employee retirement savings plan governed by section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Webster Bank matches 100 % of the first 2 % and 50 % of the next 6 % of employees&#8217; pre-tax contributions based on annual compensation. If a participant fails to make a pre-tax contribution election within 90 days of his or her date of hire, automatic pre-tax contributions will commence 90 days after his or her date of hire at a rate equal to 3% of compensation. 

Compensation and benefit expense included $ 13.2 million, $ 12.4 million, and $ 12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, of employer contributions. 

Note 19: Share-Based Plans 

Stock Compensation Plans 

Webster maintains stock compensation plans to better align the interests of its employees and directors with those of its shareholders. The Plans have shareholder approval for up to 13.4 million shares of common stock. At December 31, 2019, there were 1.6 million common shares remaining available for grant, while no stock appreciation rights have been granted. Stock compensation cost is recognized over the required service vesting period for the awards, based on the grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, and is included as a component of compensation and benefits reflected in non-interest expense. 

Stock compensation expense for restricted stock of $ 12.6 million, $ 11.6 million, and $ 12.3 million, and an income tax benefit of $ 6.1 million, $ 8.5 million, and $ 11.8 million, was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019 there was $ 15.7 million of unrecognized stock compensation expense for restricted stock, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. 

The following table summarizes the activity under the stock compensation plans for the year ended December 31, 2019:

Time-based restricted stock . Time-based restricted stock awards vest over the applicable service period ranging from 1 to 3 years. The number of time-based awards that may be granted to an eligible individual in a calendar year is limited to 100,000 shares. Compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period based on fair value, which is measured using the Company's common stock closing price at the date of grant. 

Performance-based restricted stock . Performance-based restricted stock awards vest after a 3 year performance period. The awards vest with a share quantity dependent on that performance, in a range from zero to 150 %. The performance criteria for 50 % of the shares granted in 2019 is based upon Webster's ranking for total shareholder return versus Webster's compensation peer group companies and the remaining 50 % is based upon Webster's average of return on equity during the 3 year vesting period. The compensation peer group companies are utilized because they represent the financial institutions that best compare with Webster. The Company records compensation expense over the vesting period, based on a fair value calculated using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which allows for the incorporation of the performance condition for the 50 % of the performance-based shares tied to total shareholder return versus the compensation peer group, and based on a fair value of the market price on the date of grant for the remaining 50 % of the performance-based shares tied to Webster's return on equity. Compensation expense is subject to adjustment based on management's assessment of Webster's return on equity performance relative to the target number of shares condition. 

The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $ 12.5 million, $ 11.1 million, and $ 12.7 million, respectively. 

Stock options . Stock option awards have an exercise price equal to the market price of Webster Financial Corporation's stock on the date of grant. Each option grants the holder the right to acquire a share of Webster Financial Corporation common stock over a contractual life of up to 10 years. There have been no stock options granted since 2013. At December 31, 2019, there was stock options outstanding for 420,931 shares of common stock, all of which are exercisable, with a weighted-average exercise price of $ 23.35 and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 2.7 years, comprised of 387,043 non-qualified stock options and 33,888 incentive stock options. 

Total pretax intrinsic value, which is the difference between Webster's closing stock price on the last trading day of the year and the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of shares, represents aggregate intrinsic value that would have been received by the option holders had they all exercised their options at that time. At December 31, 2019, as all awarded options have vested, all of the outstanding options are exercisable, and the aggregate intrinsic value of these options was $ 12.6 million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $ 2.4 million, $ 9.7 million, and $ 11.1 million, respectively. 

Note 20: Segment Reporting 

Webster&#8217;s operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses - Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Community Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, the type of customer served, how products and services are provided, and how discrete financial information is currently evaluated. Certain Corporate Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Description of Segment Reporting Methodology 

Webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing, and allocations for non-interest expense, provision for loan and lease losses, income taxes, and equity capital. These estimates and allocations, certain of which are subjective in nature, are periodically reviewed and refined. Changes in estimates and allocations that affect the reported results of any operating segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Webster as a whole. The full profitability measurement reports, which are prepared for each operating segment, reflect non-GAAP reporting methodologies. The differences between full profitability and GAAP results are reconciled in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business, while any mismatch associated with the matched maturity funding concept called Funds Transfer Pricing is absorbed in the Corporate Treasury function. The allocation process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business. The matched maturity funding concept considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign a Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) rate for loans and deposits originated each day. Loans are assigned an FTP rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an FTP rate for funds provided. 

Webster allocates a majority of non-interest expense to each reportable segment using a full-absorption costing process. Costs, including corporate overhead, are analyzed, pooled by process, and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment. 

The results of funds transfer pricing and allocations for non-interest expense, as well as non-interest income produces pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue, under which basis the segments are reviewed by executive management. 

Webster also allocates the provision for loan and lease losses to each segment based on management&#8217;s estimate of the inherent loss content in each of the specific loan and lease portfolios. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, Webster refined and improved the precision of this allocation approach. Prior period provision for loan and lease losses amounts, and resulting impacts from income tax expense were revised accordingly. Allowance for loan and lease losses are included within the Corporate and Reconciling category&#8217;s total assets. 

Beginning in 2018, income tax expense is estimated for each reportable segment individually. The 2017 income tax expense was estimated for all segments using the consolidated effective tax rate. 

The following table presents total assets for Webster's reportable segments and the Corporate and Reconciling category:

The major types of revenue streams that are within the scope of ASC 606 are described below: 

Deposit service fees, predominately consist of fees earned from deposit accounts and interchange fees. Fees earned from deposit accounts relate to event-driven services and periodic account maintenance activities. Webster's obligations for event-driven services are satisfied at the time the service is delivered, while the obligations for maintenance services is satisfied monthly. Interchange fees are assessed as the performance obligation is satisfied, which is at the point in time the card transaction is authorized. 

Wealth and investment services, consists of fees earned from investment and securities-related services, trust and other related services. Obligations for wealth and investment services are generally satisfied over time through a time-based measurement of progress, but certain obligations may be satisfied at points in time for activities that are transactional in nature. 

These disaggregated amounts are reconciled to non-interest income as presented in Note 20: Segment Reporting. Contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities. 

Note 22: Commitments and Contingencies 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 

The Company offers credit-related financial instruments, in the normal course of business to meet certain financing needs of its customers, that involve off-balance sheet risk. These transactions may include an unused commitment to extend credit, standby letter of credit, or commercial letter of credit. Such transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. 

Commitments to Extend Credit . The Company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to customers at a future point in time. These commitments include revolving credit arrangements, term loan commitments, and short-term borrowing agreements. Most of these loans have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses where a fee may be required. Since commitments routinely expire without being funded, or after required availability of collateral occurs, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 

Standby Letter of Credit . A standby letter of credit commits the Company to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. The Company has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit, which is often part of a larger credit agreement under which security is provided. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of a standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the Company could be required to make, and is the Company's maximum credit risk. 

Commercial Letter of Credit . A commercial letter of credit is issued to facilitate either domestic or foreign trade arrangements for customers. As a general rule, drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. Similar to a standby letter of credit, a commercial letter of credit is often secured by an underlying security agreement including the assets or inventory they relate to. 

The following table summarizes the outstanding amounts of credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk:

These commitments subject the Company to potential exposure in excess of amounts recorded in the financial statements, and therefore, management maintains a specific reserve for unfunded credit commitments. This reserve is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
