Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, references herein to &#8220;South State,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or similar references mean South State Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary. References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means South State Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association, a national banking association. 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

South State Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), a national banking association. The Bank also operates South State Advisory, Inc. (formerly First Southeast 401K Fiduciaries), a wholly owned registered investment advisor. Through the merger with CenterState Bank Corporation (&#8220;CSFL&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (&#8220;Corporate Billing&#8221;), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. Also, through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 , the holding company operates R4ALL, Inc., which manages troubled loans purchased from the Bank to their eventual disposition and SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2020, we had approximately $37.8 billion in assets and 5,266 full-time equivalent employees. Through the Bank, we provide our customers with a full range of consumer, commercial, mortgage, wealth management and SBA banking services, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, business loans, agriculture loans, real estate loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, manufactured housing loans, automobile loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, and wire transfer services, through branch, ATM and digital banking channels through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. We also operate a correspondent banking division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services.

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and also analyzes our financial condition as of September 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. 

&#160; 

Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

&#8203; 

Recent Events 

&#8203; 

COVID-19 

&#8203; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of all of the states in which we have financial centers and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of some businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. 

&#8203; 

While o ur business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that were deemed, or who were employed by businesses that were deemed, to be non-essential. Although states in our market area have allowed businesses to reopen in the second and third quarters of 2020 that were deemed non-essential, there are still many restrictions, and our customers are still being adversely effected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many of the states in our market area, as the economies have been allowed to reopen, there has been an increase in cases of COVID-19 and some restrictions have been reinstated. 

&#8203; 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, and has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of general operations, with a more limited impact to our mortgage and correspondent banking business lines. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors. 

&#8203; 

Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. As part of our efforts to practice social distancing, in March 2020, we closed all of our banking lobbies and began conducting most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we allowed a majority of our workforce to work from home. In October 2020, we have begun to reopen our banking lobbies in our branch locations, but a majority of our support staff is still working from home. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments from 90 to 180 days for consumer and commercial customers. For customers directly impacted by the COVID-19, we suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. 

&#160; 

Future governmental actions may require more of these and other types of customer-related responses. For non-FHA insured loans that were not directly impacted by the COVID-19, normal collection efforts and foreclosure filings resumed at the end of the third quarter 2020. Eviction actions remain suspended through 12/31/20 per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency Order 2020-19654. 

&#8203; 

As of October 23, 2020, we have deferrals of $452 million, or 1.98%, of our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans. For commercial loans, the standard deferral was 90 days for both principal and interest, 120 days of principal only or 180 days of interest only. For consumer and mortgage loans, the standard deferral was 120 days of both principal and interest or 180 days of interest only. We have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals. In terms of available lines of credit, the company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines. As of September 30, 2020, below are the loan portfolios which we view are of the greatest risk: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Lodging (hotel / motel) loan portfolio - 12% is under deferral, and the weighted average loan to value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) was 55%. The Company currently has $973 million, or 4.2% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in lodging loans. &#8203; 

&#9679; Restaurant loan portfolio &#8211; 2% is under deferral, and the weighted average LTV of real estate secured was 55%. The Company currently has $497 million, or 2.2% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in restaurants. &#8203; 

&#9679; Retail loan portfolio &#8211; 4% of retail CRE loan portfolio is under deferral and the weighted average LTV of 57%. The Company currently has $2.2 billion, or 9.5% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in retail CRE loans. &#8203; 

Also, we have extended credit to both customers and non-customers related to the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). As of September 30, 2020, we have produced approximately 20,000 loans totaling approximately $2.4 billion through the PPP. While deferrals have decreased materially during the third quarter, given the fluidity of the pandemic and the risk there may be new lockdowns or restrictions on business activities to slow the spread of the virus, there is no guarantee that some loan not currently on deferral might return to deferral status. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to suspend TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria defined under the CARES Act. 

&#8203; 

We are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. We implemented ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 related to the calculation for our ACL for loans, investments, unfunded commitments and other financial assets. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic in our CECL models and moving to one CECL model (with the merged bank) during the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 which was significantly higher than the third quarter of 2019 but significantly less than the second quarter of 2020 when the provision for credit losses was comprised of three major components: (1) $119.1 million for the day 1 provision for loans without significant credit deterioration (&#8220;Non-PCD&#8221;) acquired from CSFL, (2) $31.3 million from the legacy South State loan portfolio, and (3) $1.1 million from the acquired CSFL loan portfolio since the merger date. We also adjust our investment securities portfolio to market each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold, as well as reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio. 

&#8203; 

We also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Additional detail in regards to the goodwill analysis is disclosed below under the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets section of the Recent Events.

&#8203; 

&#160; 

CenterState Bank Corporation Merger 

&#8203; 

On June 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CSFL, the financial holding company for CenterState Bank National Association (&#8220;CSB&#8221;), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SouthState Bank (&#8220;SSB&#8221;), a South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned bank subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into CSB, a national banking association and wholly owned bank subsidiary of CSFL, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank (the &#8220;Bank Merger&#8221;). In connection with the Bank Merger, CSB changed its name to &#8220;SouthState Bank, National Association&#8221; (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). CSFL common shareholders received 0.3001 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for each share of CSFL stock resulting in the Company issuing 37,271,069 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for CSFL was $2.3 billion including the value of the conversion of outstanding warrants, stock options and restricted stock units totaling $15.4 million. 

&#8203; 

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $13.0 billion of loans (excluding loans held for sale) at fair value, net of $239.5 million, or 1.82%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance. Of the total loans acquired, Management identified $3.1 billion with credit deficiencies that were identified as Purchased Credit Deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans. The Company assumed $15.6 billion in deposits including a $20.2 million premium for fixed maturity time deposits. 

&#8203; 

As a result of the Bank Merger, the Bank is now a national banking association that is subject to primary

supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;) and subject to the National Bank Act and is no longer subject to supervision and regulation by the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is no longer the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, and the Bank is now a member of the Federal Reserve System.

&#8203; 

Branch Consolidation 

&#8203; 

As a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies, the Company announced the closing and consolidation of 20 branch locations in November of 2020. The expected cost associated with these closures and cost initiatives is estimated to be approximately $5.0 million, and primarily includes personnel, facilities and equipment cost. The annual savings in 2021 of these closures is expected to be $7.0 million, and the impact on 2020 is anticipated to be approximately $825,000. Eleven of the locations are in Florida, five in South Carolina, two in North Carolina, one in Georgia and one in Alabama. 

&#8203; 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by Management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Due to the Merger between the Company and CSFL, effective June 7, 2020, Management collectively evaluated loans utilizing two different methodologies for the second quarter. Management adopted one methodology during the third quarter of 2020. Management used the one systematic methodology to determine its ACL 

&#160; 

for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets&#8221; in this MD&#38;A.

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of September 30, 2020, December 31, 201 9 and September 30, 2019 , the balance of goodwill was $1.6 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

&#8203; 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step 1 of the previous accounting guidance&#8217;s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2 which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity will still be able to perform today&#8217;s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before determining whether to proceed to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. This guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.

&#8203; 

We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, our annual test date, considering the effects of COVID-19 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value and tangible book value. However, during the first quarter of 2020, our stock price fell below book value and has remained below book value during the second and third quarter of 2020. This drop in stock price was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. The lowest trading price for our stock during the first nine months of 2020 was $40.42, and the stock price closed on September 30, 2020 at $48.15, which was below book value of $64.34 but above tangible book value of $39.83. The Company completed its annual valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, taking into account the Company&#8217;s drop in stock price in 2020, and taking into account the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on the U.S. economy and the economies of the markets in which we operate. Along with its internal analysis, the Company received a limited independent third party valuation of its goodwill, and based upon the valuation and our analysis, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the economy continues to deteriorate and our stock price remains at current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition (&#8220;noncompete&#8221;) intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

&#160; 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including available-for-sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post- retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at September 30, 2020 or 2019. 

&#8203; 

Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale 

&#8203; 

Other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Prior to the merger with CSFL, we classified former branch sites as held for sale OREO. During the second quarter of 2020 and with the merger with CSFL, the Company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line within the balance sheet. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the Statement of Net Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph. 

&#8203; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO expense and loan related expense, a component of non-interest expense. 

&#8203; 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $95.2 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.34, for the third quarter of 2020 as compared to consolidated net income of $51.6 million, or diluted EPS of $1.50, in the comparable period of 2019, a 84.7% increase in consolidated net income and a 10.7% decrease in diluted EPS. The $43.6 million increase in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $145.3 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $129.4 million increase in interest income from acquired loans due to an increase in average acquired loans from the merger with CSFL and a $12.9 million increase in interest income on non-acquired loans. Non-acquired loan interest income increased due to the $2.5 billion increase in average balance, although the interest rate declined by 48 basis points. This increase in loan interest income was offset by a $1.5 million decline in interest income on federal funds sold due to a decline in yield of 205 basis points from the falling interest rate environment, even though the average balance increased by $3.9 billion from the merger with CSFL and the funds that flowed in from the CARES Act stimulus; &#9679; A $2.3 million increase in interest expense, which resulted from the increase in average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $12.3 billion from the CARES Act stimulus and from the merger with CSFL, even though there was a 

&#160; 

47 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019. The Federal Reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The third quarter of 2020 reflects the full impact of these actions and the Company&#8217;s move to reduce the interest rate paid on deposits; &#9679; A $25.8 million increase in the provision for credit losses, which resulted primarily from the provision for credit losses on Non-PCD loans of $7.1 million and from the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $22.1 million during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were primarily due to the adoption of a new model used in the third quarter of 2020 for the Bank. The new methodology for unfunded commitments utilizes a funding rate, as opposed to a utilization rate which was a method applied to the SouthState legacy portfolio prior to the third quarter, to determine the reserve for each respective segment of unfunded commitments. &#9679; A $77.2 million increase in noninterest income, which resulted primarily from the full quarter impact of CSFL noninterest income included in the third quarter of 2020. The largest increases were a $41.9 million increase in mortgage banking income and a $25.7 million increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income. These increases were partially offset by a decline in recoveries on acquired loans of $1.4 million (now part of ACL as a result of the CECL adoption) and from lower securities gains of $422,000. (See Noninterest Income section on page 84 for further discussion); &#9679; A $140.5 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from the full quarter impact of CSFL noninterest expense included in the third quarter of 2020. The largest increases were from salary and benefits which totaled $75.4 million, merger-related expense of $21.7 million, occupancy expense of $12.0 million and information services expense of $10.0 million. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 85 for further discussion) ; and &#9679; A $10.2 million increase in the provision for income taxes . This increase was primarily due to an increase in pretax book income of $53.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was slightly lower in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019, due primarily to the additional federal tax credits available in the current quarter. &#8203; 

Total nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) decreased by $15.8 million from June 30, 2020 to $126.2 million as of September 30, 2020 due to lower acquired nonaccrual loans and lower acquired OREO. The year over year change totaled $88.7 million, and was the result of the merger with CSFL on June 7, 2020, and the increase related to loans formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans), prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing in prior periods, due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. NPAs as a percentage of total loans and repossessed assets declined by 6 basis points for the period ended September 30, 2020 to 50 basis points compared to 56 basis points at June 30, 2020, respectively, and increased by 17 basis points as compared to September 30, 2019. This increase was related to the addition of the non-accrual acquired credit impaired loans into NPAs due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Nonperforming assets have been reduced by former bank property held for sale. Prior to the merger, the Company included this information in nonperforming assets but is now reported as a separate item on the balance sheet. All periods have been reclassified to reflect this change . NPAs increased $85.4 million from $40.8 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to the merger with CSFL and the change due to ASU 2016-13 referenced above. Annualized net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2020 were 0.01% of total average loans, or $594,000. 

&#8203; 

Non-acquired NPAs increased $2.6 million from $20.7 million at September 30, 2019 to $23.3 million at September 30, 2020, which resulted from a $3.3 million increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans. Non-acquired NPAs as a percentage of non-acquired loans and repossessed assets declined to 0.20% at September 30, 2020 from 0.23% at September 30, 2019. Non-acquired NPAs decreased $539,000 from $23.8 million at December 31, 2019. Acquired NPAs increased $86.1 million from $16.8 million at September 30, 2019 to $102.9 million at September 30, 2020, which was due primarily to the merger with CSFL and the adoption of ASU 2016-13 referenced above. 

&#8203; 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating its allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses for further details. At September 30, 2020, the ACL was $440.2 million, or 1.74% of period end loans. Additionally, with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded separately a reserve for unfunded commitments of $43.2 million, or 0.94% of unfunded commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit. For prior comparative periods, the ACL was $434.6 million, or 1.70%, of period-end loans at June 30, 2020 and the allowance for loan losses on loans was $54.9 million, or 0.49%, at September 30, 2019. The ACL provides 3.91 times coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2020. At December 31, 2019 and 

&#160; 

September 30, 2019, the allowance for loan losses on non-acquired nonperforming loans provided coverage of 2.50 times and 2.86 times, respectively . We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of September 30, 2020. The increase in the ACL was the result of the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Provision for credit losses &#8211; PCD loans ($610,000) and Non-PCD loans ($7.1 million) of $7.7 million (ASU 2016-13 requirement) reflective of one model implemented during the third quarter of 2020 &#9679; Provision for credit losses &#8211; unfunded commitments of $22.1 million reflective of one model implemented during the third quarter of 2020 &#9679; Net charge-offs, $594,000, or 0.01% annualized &#9679; Allowance for credit losses on PCD loans of $153.7 million &#8203; 

During the third quarter of 2020, acquired loan interest income increased $102.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. The yield on acquired loans was down to 4.76% at September 30, 2020 from 5.08% at June 30, 2020. The decrease in the yield in the third quarter of 2020 was primarily the result of the continued low interest rate environment. Loan accretion income recognized in the third quarter of 2020 totaled $22.4 million and included the full third quarter of loan accretion income from the CSFL acquired loan portfolio. Accretion income increased from $10.1 million in the second quarter of 2020 to $22.4 million in the third quarter of 2020. Acquired period-end loan balances decreased by $1.2 billion and acquired loans average balance increased by $8.8 billion, from June 30, 2020, due to the merger with CSFL. 

&#8203; 

The table below provides an analysis of the yield on our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, including both non-acquired and acquired loans. The acquired loan yield decreased from the third quarter of 2019 due to the PPP loans acquired in the CSFL merger and overall lower rate environment. Non-acquired loan yields also declined due to the low yielding PPP loans originated during the third quarter of 2020.

(1) The accretion income on acquired loans includes the accretion from the discount on all acquired loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. In our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the accretion income on acquired loans included the accretion from the discount on the acquired non-credit impaired loan only. For the prior period, we reclassified the discount recognized related to acquired credit impaired loans to make the table comparable. This change was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which changed the accounting related to the acquired loan portfolio. &#8203; 

Compared to the balance at June 30, 2020, our non-acquired loan portfolio increased $0.9 billion, or 35.2% annualized, to $11.5 billion, driven by growth in all categories except other loans. Commercial and industrial loans and commercial owner occupied loans led the way with $366.6 million and $214.8 million in quarterly loan growth, respectively, or 62.9% and 45.6% annualized growth, respectively. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $1.2 billion, or 32% annualized, to $13.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $14.9 billion at June 30, 2020, from paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and NonPCD loan categories. Since September 30, 2019, the non-acquired loan 

&#160; 

portfolio has grown by $2.6 billion, or 29.2%, driven by increases in all loan categories. The largest increases were in the following three categories: Commercial and industrial loans with $1.6 billion in loan growth, commercial owner occupied loan growth with $411.5 million, and commercial non-owner occupied loans of $333.1 million. Since September 30, 2019, the acquired loan portfolio increased by $11.3 billion, or 480.2% due to the merger with CSFL. 

&#8203; 

Compared to the second quarter of 2020, non-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $107.8 million or 66.3% due to the first full quarter of results after the merger with CSFL. The increase in net interest income during the third quarter of 2020 was mainly due to the increase in interest income on loans of $110.5 million (non-acquired loans interest income increased $8.2 million and acquired loans interest income increased $102.2 million), an increase in interest income on loans held for sale of $2.7 million and higher interest income from investment securities of $0.8 million. Interest expense increased $6.9 million during the quarter with the increase in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities of $8.3 billion from the merger with CSFL in June. Rates dropped on funding cost by eight basis points as the Bank continued to adjust deposit pricing during the third quarter of 2020 with the low interest rate environment. Interest expense from deposits increased by $2.5 million, from corporate and subordinated debt by $3.1 million, and from other borrowings by $1.2 million. The increase in interest income on non-acquired loans was due to an increase in the average balance of $757.5 million, which was the result of overall loan growth during the third quarter of 2020. The effects from the increase in the average balance on non-acquired loans was partially offset by the decline in yield of 1 basis point due to the continued low rate environment that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic and the CARES Act passed in early Spring of 2020. Acquired loan interest income improved by $102.2 million as the average balance increased by $8.8 billion (the result of a full quarter of loans outstanding) partially offset by the effects from a 32 basis points decrease on the yield for acquired loans, which was attributed to the lower rate environment and PPP loans. The increase in interest income from investment securities was due to a higher average balance of $920.5 million from the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020 partially offset by a lower yield. Interest income on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits increased by $0.8 million. The increase in interest income from federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits was due to an increase in yield of 2 basis points and the full effect for the quarter on a much higher average balance from the merger with CSFL, an increase of $2.4 billion compared to the prior quarter. The increase in interest income from loans held for sale was due to an increase in the average balance of $353.4 million, primarily from the merger with CSFL. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings was the result of the impact of the assumed balances from the CSFL merger being included for the full quarter compared to 23 days in the second quarter of 2020. The non-taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020 by 2 basis points from 3.23% to 3.21%. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to the decrease in yield on interest-earning assets of 7 basis points offset by 8 basis point decline in the yield on interest-bearing liabilities. The decline in the overall cost of funds, including demand deposits of 6 basis points reflects the full quarter impact of the merger with CSFL on all categories of deposits resulting in a 9 basis point decline in the cost of total deposits. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings, resulting from full quarter impact of balances assumed from the CSFL merger along with the increase in cost on the cash flow hedges on the Federal Home Loan Bank advances. 

&#8203; 

Compared to the third quarter of 2019, non-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $143.0 million, or 112.2%, and the non-taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.21% from 3.72%. For further discussion of the comparison of net interest income and net interest margin for the periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, see Net Interest Income and Margin section below on page 70. 

&#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio decreased to 61.4% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 80.5% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased from 58.4% in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in the efficiency ratio compared to the second quarter of 2020 was the result of a $168.2 million, or 77.6%, increase in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by a $61.8 million, or 35.3%, increase in noninterest expense. These increases were the result of including the income and expense for a full quarter from the merger with CSFL in the third quarter of 2020 compared to only 23 days in the second quarter of 2020. Within noninterest income, the mortgage banking business continues to benefit from low interest rate environment coupled with the correspondent banking business added from the merger with CSFL. 

&#8203; 

Diluted and basic EPS were $1.34 and $1.34, respectively for the third quarter of 2020, compared to the third quarter of 2019 which were $1.51 and $1.50, respectively. The increase in net income in the third quarter of 2020 was attributable to the first full quarter of income and expense after the merger with CSFL, which occurred in early June 2020. In addition, the Company had $21.7 million in merger-related expense in the current quarter compared to no 

&#160; 

merger-related expense or branch conversion cost in the third quarter of 2019. In addition, the weighted average common shares increased to 71.1 million shares, or 107.2%, due to the merger with CSFL compared to 34.3 million weighted average shares outstanding at September 30, 2019. The total number of shares outstanding at September 30, 2020 totaled 70,928,304, which includes 37.3 million shares issued in the merger with CSFL in June of 2020. The increase in net income was due to the full quarter impact of the CSFL merger in the third quarter of 2020, which did not affect any of the third quarter of 2019. The increase in outstanding shares from September 30, 2019 was due to the merger with CSFL.

* - Denotes a non-GAAP financial measure. The section titled &#8220;Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP&#8221; below provides a table that reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended September 30, 2020, return on average tangible equity decreased to 14.66% compared to 16.62% for the same period in 2019. This decrease was the result of an increase in average tangible equity of $1.5 billion, or 115.9%, being greater than the increase in net income, excluding amortization of intangibles, of $48.7 million, or 90.0%, during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019. The increase in net income and increase in average tangible equity were both due to the merger with CSFL, which fully impacted the third quarter of 2020. &#9679; For the three months ended September 30, 2020, return on average assets was 1.00 %, a decrease from 1.31 % for the three months ended September 30, 2019. This decline was due to the effect of the increase in net income of $43.7 million, or 84.7%, during the third quarter of 2020 being less than the increase of 142.6% in average assets. The net income (merger expenses) and increase in average assets were both due to the merger with CSFL that occurred in early June 2020. &#9679; Equity to assets ratio was 12.07 % for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease from 14.92 % for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease from the comparable period in 2019 was due to the increase in total assets of 140.1% being greater than the increase in equity of 94.1%. Both the increase in assets and equity were due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. &#8203; 

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider South State&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of South State. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of South State&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Summary 

&#8203; 

Our taxable equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest margin for the third quarter of 2020 decreased by 51 basis points from 3.73% in the third quarter of 2019 to 3.22%. This decrease was due to a decrease in the yield of interest-earning assets of 87 basis points; partially offset by a decline in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 47 basis points. 

&#8203; 

Non-TE net interest margin also decreased by 51 basis points from the third quarter of 2019, for the same reason as above. The decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was due to a decrease in the yield on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits of 205 basis point, a decrease in the yield on investment securities of 106 basis point, a decrease in yield on non-acquired loans of 48 basis points and a decrease in yield on acquired loans of 156 basis points. The decrease in these yields was mostly due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The overall yield on interest-earning assets also decreased due to the significant increase in the average balance on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest earning deposit, the Company&#8217;s lowest yielding assets, which increased $3.9 billion or 796.3%. This increase was partially due to the merger with CSFL and due to the decision to hold more liquidity during the current COVID-19 pandemic and recessionary economic pressures. The effects from the decrease in yield on interest-earning assets were partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 47 basis points from 0.92% in the third quarter of 2019 to 0.45% in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease in cost on interest-bearing liabilities was due to a decrease in the cost of all categories of interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in the cost of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements. The decreases were the result of the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. The cost of corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings increased from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter in 2020 by 78 basis points to 3.39%. This increase was due the higher cost in the subordinated debentures assumed in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 along with the rising costs of the cash flow hedges on our $700 million of FHLB Advances.

Non-TE net interest income increased $143.0 million, or 112.2%, in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

1. Higher interest income by $145.3 million with acquired loan interest income increasing by $129.4 million because of higher average balances of acquired loans of $11.6 billion resulting from the merger with CSFL, higher non-acquired loan interest income of $12.9 million due to higher average balance of $2.5 billion and higher investment securities interest income of $0.9 million because of higher average balances of $1.4 billion resulting from the merger with CSFL. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a $1.5 million decline in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income as the yield declined by 205 basis points, offsetting the effects of the average balance increasing by $3.9 billion. This increase in average balance was primarily from deposits from the CARES Act and PPP loans, along with securities sold by CSFL prior to the merger. 2. Higher interest expense of $2.3 million as the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $12.3 billion in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was due to the addition of interest-bearing liabilities from the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. The main reason for this increase was interest expense on subordinated debentures and other borrowings increasing $3.9 million due the higher cost in the subordinated debentures assumed in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 along with the rising costs of the cash flow hedges on our $700 million of FHLB Advances. The average balance on subordinated debentures and other borrowing also increased $273.2 million to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by the decrease in interest expense from interest-bearing deposits of $1.5 million due to falling rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 as the cost on interest-bearing deposits declined 47 basis points from the third quarter of 2019 to 0.45%. 3. Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 87 basis points from the comparable period in 2019. The decline in yield on interest-earning assets was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020 as well as a change in asset mix. 4. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 47 basis points from the same period in 2019. This decrease occurred in all deposit categories of funding and was due to the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. 5. The Non-TE net interest margin decreased by 51 basis points and the TE net interest margin decreased by 51 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 87 basis points, which was only partially offset by the lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 47 basis points.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $13.9 billion, or 123.5%, to $25.2 billion at September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Non-acquired loans or legacy loans increased by $2.6 billion, or 29.2%, from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020 through organic loan growth and PPP loans. Acquired loans increased by $11.3 billion, or 480.2% as compared to the same period in 2019. The overall increase in acquired loans was the addition of $13.0 billion due to the merger with CSB, net of $1.8 billion of principal payments, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 54.4% at September 30, 2020 compared to 20.9% at September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio were 45.6% compared to 79.1% at September 30, 2019.

Interest earned on loans increased $142.3 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019. Some key highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans decreased 40 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and average total loans increased $14.1 billion or 125.5%, in the third quarter of 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in average total loans was the result of 470.8% growth in the average acquired loan portfolio and 28.0% growth in the average non-acquired loan portfolio during the 

&#160; 

period. The growth in the acquired loan portfolio was due to the addition of $13.0 billion in loans from the merger with CSB, net of principal payments, charge-offs, and foreclosures. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to normal organic growth and PPP loans. The yield on the acquired loan portfolio decreased from 6.32% in the third quarter of 2019 to 4.76% in the same period in 2020 and the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased from 4.31% in the third quarter of 3.83% in the same period in 2020. The decline in the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio of 48 basis points and on the acquired loan portfolio of 156 basis points was mainly due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points from September 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. This effectively decreased the Prime Rate, the rate used in pricing a majority of our new originated loans. &#160; The increase in interest income on loans was due to an increase in average loan balances of $14.1 million which was due to the merger with CSB, and loan accretion income on acquired loans totaling $22.4 million for the current quarter . The higher accretion income was due to the addition of accretion income from the loans acquired in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 and the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which eliminated loan pools and changed the accounting for acquired credit impaired loans. &#9679; The balance of mortgage loans held for sale decreased $147.2 million from June 30, 2020 to $456.1 million at September 30, 2020, and increased $368.7 million from a balance of $87.4 million at September 30, 2019. The increase from September 30, 2019 was due to the production added through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. &#8203; 

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits and repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2020, investment securities totaled $3.7 billion, compared to $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively . Our investment portfolio increased $1.7 billion from December 31, 2019 and increased $1.9 billion from September 30, 2019 mainly due to the acquisition of $1.2 billion in investment securities in the merger with CSFL. Excluding investment securities acquired in the CSFL merger, the investment securities portfolio increased by $548.0 million, or 36.51% (annualized), from December 31, 2019 and by $691.0 million, or 37.10% from September 30, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of investments acquired in the CSFL merger of $1.2 billion, purchases of $1.3 billion as well as improvements in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $48.6 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $770.9 million. N et amortization of premiums were $13.3 million in the first nine months of 2020. We continue to increase our investment securities strategically primarily with the excess funds from deposit growth. The increase in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio in the first nine months of 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was mainly due to the decrease in interest rates in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Interest earned on investment securities was higher in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. This is a result of the Bank carrying a higher average balance in investment securities in 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The average balance of investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased $1.4 billion and $868.9 million, respectively from the comparable periods in 2019. With the excess liquidity from the growth in deposits during 2019 and the first nine months of 2020 , the Bank used the excess funds to strategically increase the size of its investment portfolio. The increase in the average balance was also due to the acquisition of CSFL&#8217;s investment portfolio of $1.2 billion in June 2020. The yield on the investment portfolio declined 107 basis points and 65 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drop in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020.

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2020, we had 113 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $4.2 million. At December 31, 2019, we had 143 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $4.5 million. At September 30, 2019, we had 95 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $2.5 million. 

&#8203; 

As of September 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, the total number of available for sale securities with an unrealized loss position decreased by 30 and increased by 18 securities, respectively, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by $352,000 and increased by $1.7 million, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2019 in the number of securities in an unrealized loss position is due to the drop in both short and long term interest rates during the first half of 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the amount of the unrealized loss was mainly due to the drop in both short and long term interest rates during the last half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. In particular, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

&#8203; 

All debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2020 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the cash flows and determined that all contractual cash flows should be received; therefore impairment is temporary because we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until the maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 5 &#8211; Investment securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. While Management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

&#8203; 

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, Management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of September 30, 2020, 

&#160; 

we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of September 30, 2020, other investment securities represented approximately $185.2 million, or 0.49% of total assets and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $174.7 million, or 0.46% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

&#8203; 

Trading Securities 

&#8203; 

CSFL had a correspondent banking department that was merged with the Company on June 7, 2020. This department occasionally purchases trading securities and subsequently sells them to correspondent bank customers to take advantage of market opportunities, when presented, for short-term revenue gains. Securities purchased for this portfolio have been primarily municipal securities and are held for short periods of time. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income. At September 30, 2020, we had no trading securities. 

&#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts.

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $12.3 billion in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increase in interest-bearing deposits of $11.6 billion, an increase in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements of $437.4 million and increase in other borrowings of $273.2 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits is due to the acquisition of $10.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits from the CSFL merger during the second quarter of 2020. We continue to focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which increased $310.6 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $15.6 billion since December 31, 2019. The increase from December 31, 2019 consisted of $12.9 billion through the merger and $2.7 billion, organically. These funds are normally lower cost funds. The increase in average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements was also due the merger with CSFL. Federal funds purchased related to the correspondent bank division and repurchase agreements acquired in the merger with CSFL averaged $422.4 million during the third quarter of 2020 which makes up most of the increase. The increase in average corporate and subordinated debt and other borrowings was also due to the merger with CSFL as the Company assumed $271.5 million in subordinated debt and trust preferred debt in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in interest expense of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was driven by higher interest expense on corporate and subordinated debt and other borrowings of $3.9 million due to both the increase in average balance of $273.2 million and a higher average cost of 78 basis points. The higher cost on borrowings was due to the increase in cost on the cash flow hedges on the $700.0 million of FHLB borrowings and to the addition of the subordinated debt from the merger with CSFL which carried a higher average cost. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits declined by $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The cost on interest-bearing deposits was 0.30% for the third quarter of 2020 compared to 0.77% for the same period in 2019. The decline in cost related to deposits was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. These changes resulted in a 47 basis point decrease in the average rate on all interest-bearing liabilities from 0.92% to 0.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Interest-bearing deposits increased $11.6 billion to $20.3 billion at September 30, 2020 from the period end balance at September 30, 2019 of $8.7 billion. The increase from September 30, 2019 was driven by an increase in interest-bearing transactional accounts including money markets of $8.1 billion, savings of $1.3 billion and in certificate of deposits of $2.1 billion. Excluding deposits assumed in the CSFL merger, interest-bearing deposits increased $1.4 billion, which was comprised by an increase in transactional interest-bearing 

&#160; 

accounts, including money markets, of $1.2 million and savings of $207.9 million. Certificate of deposits declined $65.2 million. We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. &#9679; Average transaction and money market account balances increased $8.1 billion, or 145.0% to $13.7 billion from the average balance in the third quarter of 2019. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts decreased $1.1 million. The effects from the increase in average balance were partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 23 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on the transaction and money market account is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; Average savings account balances increased 93.6%, or $1.2 billion, to $2.6 billion from the average balance in the third quarter of 2019. Interest expense on savings accounts decreased $443,000. The effects from the increase in average balance were offset by a 22 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 9 basis points for the three months September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on savings accounts is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; Average balance on certificates of deposit and other time deposits increased 132.1%, or $2.3 billion to $4.0 billion from the average balance in the third quarter of 2019. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposit accounts increased $21,000 thousand as a result of the increase in average balance. The effects from the increase in average balance were mostly offset by a 87 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 67 basis points for the three months September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on certificates of deposit and other time deposit accounts is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; In the third quarter of 2020, as discussed above, average other borrowings increased $273.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. The average rate on other borrowings experienced a 78 basis point increase to 3.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2.61% for the same period in 2019. The increase in the average cost of other borrowings is due to the increase in cost on the cash flow hedges on the $700.0 million of FHLB borrowings and the addition of the subordinated debt from the CSFL merger which had a higher cost. For the third quarter of 2020, the average rate for our long term trust preferred debt and subordinated debt was 5.14% while the cost of our FHLB advances and FRB borrowings was 2.41%. This compares to 4.80% and 2.24%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2019. &#8203; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $6.5 billion, or 201.05%, to $9.8 billion in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $3.3 billion during the same period in 2019. At September 30, 2020, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $9.7 billion, exceeding the September 30, 2019 balance by $6.4 billion. This increase in both period end and average assets was due to the noninterest-bearing deposits of $5.3 billion acquired in the merger with CSFL in June 2020. We continue to focus on increasing the noninterest-bearing deposits to try and limit our funding costs. Our overall cost of funds including noninterest-bearing deposits was 0.31% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 0.69% for the three months ended September 30, 2019. 

&#8203; 

Provision for Credit Losses 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. 

&#8203; 

Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#160; 

&#8203; 

The Company merged with CenterState Bank Corporation (&#8220;CSFL&#8221; or &#8220;CenterState&#8221;) on June 7, 2020. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, given the proximity of the merger date to the quarter end, Management collectively evaluated loans from each legacy loan portfolio utilizing pre-existing methodologies implemented prior to the merger and aggregated the result. During the third quarter, Management consolidated the two methodologies into one to arrive at the ACL recorded at September 30, 2020 for both the ACL related to the loan portfolio and the reserve related to the unfunded commitments (off-balance-sheet credit exposures). The new methodology for unfunded commitments utilizes a funding rate, as opposed to a utilization rate which was a method applied to the SouthState legacy portfolio prior to the third quarter, to determine the reserve for each respective segment of unfunded commitments. This new method, along with the change in mix of unfunded commitments, resulted in an increase in the reserve for legacy SouthState Bank unfunded commitments during the third quarter of 2020. 

&#8203; 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other. 

&#8203; 

In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. It therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The baseline forecast incorporates a 50% probability of the United States economy performing better than this projection and the same as the probability that it will perform worse. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four quarter forecast and a four quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Lending Policy; 2) Economic conditions not captured in models; 3) Volume and Mix of Loan Portfolio; 4) Past Due Trends; 5) Concentration Risk; 6) External Factors; and 7) Model Limitations. 

&#8203; 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. During the third quarter of 2020, we consolidated the ACL models and due to the size of the combined company elected to increase the threshold for individually-evaluated loans to all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. We will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of 

&#160; 

estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a trouble debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to suspend TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. 

&#8203; 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. 

&#8203; 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of September 30, 2020, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $97.8 million. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet with an offsetting income statement expense. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. As part of the new combined ACL methodology implemented during the current quarter, Management completed a funding study based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applied this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Prior to the current quarter, the Company applied a utilization rate instead of a funding rate to the South State legacy portfolio to determine the reserve for unfunded commitments. As of September 30, 2020, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments in Other Liabilities was $43.2 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision for credit losses in the Statements of Income. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating it allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses for further details. As of September 30, 2020, the balance of the ACL was $440.2 million or 1.74% of total loans. The ACL increased $5.6 million from the balance of $434.6 million recorded at June 30, 2020. This increase during the third quarter of 2020 included a $7.7 million provision for credit losses partially offset by $0.6 million in net charge-offs and a $1.5 million adjustment to the PCD allowance related to measurement period adjustments on loans acquired from CSFL. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the ACL increased $383.3 million from the balance of $56.9 million. This increase included a $181.4 million provision for credit losses during the period, a $149.4 million allowance for credit losses on PCD loans acquired from CSFL and an increase of $54.5 million through the impact of the initial adoption of CECL. These increases were partially offset by $2.0 million in net charge-offs. The impact of COVID-19 was modeled in the forecasted loss period and macroeconomic assumptions. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2020, the Company also had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $43.2 million which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet, compared to $21.1 million at June 30, 2020. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its reserve on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $22.1 million and $36.4 million, respectively. Of these amounts, $9.6 million was related to the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. These amounts were recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Statements of Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first nine months of 2020. 

&#8203; 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the allowance for non-acquired loan losses was $54.9 million, or 0.62%, of non-acquired period-end loans. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the allowance was adjusted by $54.5 million. The ACL provides 3.91 times coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2020. Net charge offs to the total average loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were 0.01% and 0.02%, respectively. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of September 30, 2020.

(1) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). In prior periods, these loans, which were called acquired credit impaired (&#8220;ACI&#8221;) loans were excluded from nonperforming assets. The adoption of CECL resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for ACI loans and replaced it with loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased by $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 from these loans. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. (2) Periods prior to the adoption of CECL exclude the acquired credit impaired loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more totaling $9.2 million and $8.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively, including the valuation discount. (3) Excludes certain real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure and property not intended for bank use. (4) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (5) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (6) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (7) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $2.3 million, $2.0 million, $2.7 million, $2.7 million and $2.3 million as of September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019, March 31, 2020, September 30, 2019, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. 

&#160; 

(8) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $22.2 million, $23.5 million, $2.7 million, $2.7 million and $2.7 million as of September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. &#8203; 

Total nonperforming assets were $126.2 million, or 0.50% of total loans and repossessed assets, at September 30, 2020, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 11.1%, from June 30, 2020, and an increase of $88.7 million, or 236.9%, from September 30, 2019. Total nonperforming loans were $112.4 million, or 0.45%, of total loans, at September 30, 2020, a decrease of $10.8 million, or 8.8%, from June 30, 2020, and an increase of $83.7 million, or 290.6%, from September 30, 2019. Non-acquired nonperforming loans declined by $0.4 million from June 30, 2020. Acquired nonperforming loans declined $10.4 million from June 30, 2020. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances in the above schedule at September 30, 2020, compared to September 30, 2019, was due to the addition of the above mentioned loans related to the merger with CSB, as well as the addition of $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020, formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans). Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing, due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. There was an increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans of $3.3 million from September 30, 2019, which were primarily restructured loans.

At September 30, 2020, OREO totaled $13.5 million which included $0.7 million in non-acquired OREO and $12.8 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO decreased $4.5 million from June 30, 2020 and increased $5.1 million from September 30, 2019, which was primarily due to the CSB acquisition. At September 30, 2020, non-acquired OREO consisted of 8 properties with an average value of $91,000. This compared to 10 properties with an average value of $118,000 at June 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, acquired OREO consisted of 47 properties with an average value of $271,000. This compared to 66 properties with an average value of $255,000 at June 30, 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, we added no new properties into non-acquired OREO, and we sold 2 properties with an aggregate value of $455,000. For acquired OREO we added 3 properties with an aggregate value of $205,000 and sold 22 properties with an aggregate value of $4.7 million during the current quarter. 

&#8203; 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans (excluding all acquired loans) totaled $3.9 million, or 0.03%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at September 30, 2020, compared to $4.2 million, or 0.04%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at June 30, 2020, and compared to $7.6 million, or 0.09% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at September 30, 2019. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $22.7 million, or 0.17%, of total acquired loans outstanding, at September 30, 2020, compared to $29.6 million, or 0.20% of total acquired loans outstanding, at June 30, 2020. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, prior period acquired problem loans included only the non-credit impaired loans. At September 30, 2019, the acquired non-credit impaired potential problem loans were $5.0 million, or 0.25%, of acquired non-credit impaired loans outstanding. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused Management to have serious concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms.

Noninterest income increased by $77.2 million, or 205.4%, during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This quarterly change in total noninterest income primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in the third quarter of 2020 by $2.4 million than the same quarter in 2019, due primarily to the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. &#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $41.9 million, or 685.3%, which was primarily from higher income from the secondary market of $39.9 million, net of an increase in commissions totaling $8.6 million, due to higher activity and sales volume resulting from the decrease in interest rates and a higher margin, and from the addition of loan production from the CSFL merger. MSR income, net of the hedge which increased by $2.0 million comparing third quarter of 2020 to the same quarter one year ago. &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income increased by $25.7 million with $24.4 million of the increase being attributable to correspondent banking division of CSFL acquired in the second quarter of 2020. Legacy capital markets income increased approximately $1.4 million due primarily to a reduction in the CVA loss recorded in the current quarter. &#9679; Securities gains, net of $437,000 during the third quarter of 2019 while there were securities gains, net of $15,000 in the third quarter of 2020 . &#9679; There were no recoveries on acquired loans recorded in the income statement in the third quarter of 2020, due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of 2020. Recoveries on acquired loans are no longer recorded through the income statement and are recorded through the ACL on the balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2019, there were $1.4 million in recoveries on acquired loans recorded through the income statement. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income is now separately reported (not included in other) in the table above and resulted in higher income from the merger with CSFL than the third quarter of 2019. &#9679; Other income was higher by $4.0 million due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was mainly due to increases in SBA loan servicing fees, gains on sale of SBA loans and rental income. &#8203; 

Noninterest income increased by $106.0 million, or 98.8%, during the first nine month of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This quarterly change in total noninterest income primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were lower in 2020 by $600,000 compared to 2019, due primarily to lower non-sufficient fund fees as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic due to funds provided by the CARES Act for customers leading to higher deposit balances and due to less spending and activity during the quarter. &#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $67.2 million, or 487.0%, which was primarily the result of higher income from the secondary market of $64.9 million, net of an increase in commissions totaling $10.3 million, due to higher activity and sales volume resulting from the decrease in interest rates and a higher margin, and from the addition of loan production from the CSFL merger. Income from MSR, net of the hedge increased $2.3 million comparing 2020 to 2019. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income increased by $35.5 million with the primary increase being attributable to correspondent banking division of CSB acquired in the second quarter of 2020. Legacy capital markets income increased approximately $2.8 million due to an increase in fee income from swap transactions. &#9679; Securities gains, net of $2.7 million during 2019 while there were securities gains, net of $15,000 from sales of available for sale securities in 2020. &#9679; There were no recoveries on acquired loans recorded in the income statement in 2020, due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of 2020. Recoveries on acquired loans are no longer recorded through the income statement and are recorded through the ACL on the balance sheet. In 2019, there were $4.6 million in recoveries on acquired loans recorded through the income statement. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income is now separately reported (not included in other) in the table above. Income from BOLI increased $3.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to an increase in income from the payout of insurance policies and from the addition of BOLI through the merger with CSFL. &#9679; Other income was higher by $4.5 million due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was mainly due to increases in SBA loan servicing fees, gains on sale of SBA loans and rental income. &#8203;

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $140.5 million, or 145.8%, in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following:

&#8203; 

&#9679; An increase in merger-related and branch consolidation related expense of $21.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. The costs in the third quarter of 2020 were related to the merger with CSFL while they were no costs in the third quarter of 2019 related to branch consolidation and other cost saving initiatives. &#9679; Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $75.4 million, or 126.6%, in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in all categories of salaries and benefits due to the increase in employees through the merger with CSFL in June 2020. Full time equivalent employees increased 2,722 to 5,266 at September 30, 2020 through the merger with CSFL. &#9679; The increases in the other line items, including occupancy expense, information services expense, amortization of intangibles, FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges and other noninterest expense, include full quarter of the expenses related to CSFL. &#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $215.2 million, or 70.8%, in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The categories and explanations for the increases year-to-date are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 19.61% and 7.38% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 20.13% and 20.05% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the quarter was driven mainly by generating pre-tax book income during the current quarter whereas the Company generated a pre-tax book loss during the second quarter of 2020, increasing the income tax benefit recorded on the rate-impacting items during that quarter. The lower year-to-date effective tax rate compared to the same period in 2019 is driven mainly by lower pre-tax book income as well as additional federal tax credits available in the current year and a favorable revaluation of the legacy South State deferred taxes due to an updated deferred tax rate resulting from the merger with CenterState.

&#8203; 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of September 30, 2020, shareholders&#8217; equity was $4.6 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion, or 92.3%, from December 31, 2019, and an increase of $2.2 billion, or 94.1%, from $2.4 billion at September 30, 2019. The change from year-end was mainly attributable to the increase in equity through the issuance of common stock and the conversion of stock options and restricted stock totaling $2.3 billion from the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. The following table shows the changes in shareholders&#8217; equity during 2020.

In June 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets (the &#8220;new Repurchase Program&#8221;). The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2019, we had repurchased 1,165,000 shares at an average price of $74.72 a share (excluding sales commission) for a total of $87.1 million in common stock under the New Repurchase Program. During the first quarter of 2020, we remained active in repurchasing our common stock and bought 320,000 shares at an average price of $77.29 per share (excludes commission expense), a total of $24.7 million. No shares were repurchased during the second or third quarter of 2020. There were 515,000 shares available for repurchase remaining under the New Repurchase Program as of September 30, 2020. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; 

&#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; 

&#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and

&#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%.

&#8203; 

Under Basel III, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the Basel III rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. With the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, the Company&#8217;s $115.0 million in trust preferred securities no longer qualifies for tier 1 capital and is now only included in tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculations. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When implemented, Basel III provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election and, as a result, retained our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

&#8203; 

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, under Basel III, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The 2.5% capital conservation buffer became fully effective for us on January 1, 2019, resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.

&#8203; 

On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the standard included a transitional method option for recognizing the day 1 effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. 

&#8203; 

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from day 1 and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. 

&#160; 

&#8203; 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

The tier 1 leverage ratio and the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased compared to December 31, 2019 due mainly to the merger with CSFL. The percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes for the tier 1 leverage ratio of 144.7% and the percentage increase in risk-based weighted assets for the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 118.0% was greater than the percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital of 104.3% at the holding company. The decline in the holding company ratios was greater than the decline at the bank due to the reduction in tier 1 risk-based capital related to the $115.0 in trust preferred debt no longer being able to be included as tier 1 capital based on the merger with CSFL along with the Company exceeding $15.0 billion in assets. The reduction in tier 1 risk based capital was also due to our repurchase of 320,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $24.7 million through our stock repurchase plans, the common stock dividend paid of $64.9 million, and a reduction in retained earnings of $44.8 million from a cumulative change in accounting principle from the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The total risk-based capital ratio increased compared to December 31, 2019 due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses that qualifies as tier 2 capital of $156.2 million and an increase in trust preferred debt and subordinated debt of $279.2 million that qualified for tier 2 capital at the holding company. The increase in the allowance was mainly due a provision for credit losses of $119.1 million recorded on the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in debt that qualifies for tier 2 capital was due to the Company acquiring $238.0 million in subordinated debt and $38.5 million in trust preferred debt in the merger with CSFL. The increase in debt that qualifies for tier 2 capital did not affect the Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital ratio because the debt is at the holding company level. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification.

&#8203; 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with monitoring liquidity management policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and 

&#160; 

investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not utilized for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and/or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. &#8203; 

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $2.3 billion, or approximately 33.0% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, and by $2.6 billion, or 29.2%, compared to the balance at September 30, 2019. Of the increased from both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, $1.1 billion was related to PPP loans made in the first nine months of 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $1.2 billion, or 17.6% from December 31, 2019 and by $1.5 billion, or 17.3% from September 30, 2019. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $11.6 billion from the balance at December 31, 2019 and by $11.3 billion from the balance at September 30, 2019. This increase was due the merger with CSFL in which the Company acquired $13.0 billion in loans in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the acquired loans in the CSFL merger, the acquired loan portfolio decreased by $1.4 billion, or 64.6% from December 31, 2019 and by $1.6 billion, or 68.1% from September 30, 2019 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans.

Our investment securities portfolio increased $1.7 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, and increased by $1.9 billion compared to the balance at September 30, 2019. Of these increases in investment securities, $1.2 billion was acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Excluding investment securities acquired in the CSFL merger, the investment portfolio increased by $548.0 million, or 27.3% from December 31, 2019 and by $691.0 million, or 37.1% from September 30, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of investments acquired in the CSFL merger of $1.2 billion, purchases of $1.3 billion as well as improvements in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $48.6 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $770.9 million. N et amortization of premiums were $13.3 million in the first nine months of 2020. The increase in investment securities excluding investments acquired in the CSFL merger was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings. Total cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 billion at September 30, 2020 as compared to $688.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $719.2 million at September 30, 2019. The Company acquired $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. Total deposits increased $2.2 billion (excluding the $15.6 billion in deposits acquired in the CSFL merger) in the first nine of 2020 which improved liquidity. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2020, December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, we had $600.0 million, $0 and $1.3 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits. We acquired $804.0 million in traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 of which $204.0 million paid out in the third quarter of 2020. At September 30, 2020, December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, we had $551.8 million, $45.8 million, and $49.2 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Of the total reciprocal brokered deposits at September 30, 2020, $458.3 million were acquired in the CSFL merger. Total deposits were $30.0 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $17.8 billion from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and an increase of $17.9 billion from $12.0 billion at September 30, 2019. This increase was mainly due the merger with CSFL in which the Company acquired $15.6 billion in deposits in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the acquired deposits in the CSFL merger, deposits increased by $2.2 billion, or 23.8% (annualized) from December 31, 2019 and by $2.3 billion, or 19.3% from September 30, 2019. Our legacy deposit growth since December 31, 2019 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $1.2 billion, an increase in savings and money market accounts of $736.1 million and an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $380.5 million partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of $4.2 million. Total other borrowings increased $273.7 million and $273.9 million, respectively, from December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 to $1.1 billion at September 30, 2020. Total short-term borrowings at September 30, 2020 were $706.7 million consisting of $351.7 million in federal funds purchased and $355.0 million in securities sold under 

&#160; 

agreements to repurchase. Total other borrowings at September 30, 2020 of $1.1 billion consists of $700.1 million in FHLB advances and $389.5 million in trust preferred and subordinated debt. Other borrowings increased approximately $273.7 million in 2020 through acquisition of trust preferred and subordinated debt in the CSFL merger during the second quarter of 2020. The Company borrowed $500 million in March 2019 and $200 million in June 2019 in 90-day fixed rate FHLB advances, which we currently plan to continuously renew. At the same time, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $350 million (a four year agreement) and $350 million (a five year agreement) to manage the interest rate risk related to these 90-day FHLB advances. We borrowed these FHLB advances to provide liquidity for operations, loan growth and investment growth. In March 2020, we executed another FHLB advance of $300.0 million at a rate of 0.47% for nine months and FRB borrowings of $200.0 million at a rate of 0.25% for three months. These borrowings executed in March 2020 were to provide additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. These borrowings were paid off in the second quarter of 2020 as the Company had excess liquidity. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise.

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, taking into account our current composition of earning assets, asset quality, capital position, and operating results. Our liquid earning assets include federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, reverse repurchase agreements, and/or other short-term investments. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our Bank&#8217;s desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, our Bank&#8217;s federal funds sold position and any balances at the Federal Reserve Bank serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity. At September 30, 2020, our Bank had total federal funds credit lines of $776.0 million with no balance outstanding. If additional liquidity were needed, the Bank would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the sale of a portion of our investment portfolio. At September 30, 2020, our Bank had $1.2 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window and had no balance outstanding. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At September 30, 2020, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $3.1 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $482.2 million and $700.1 million in outstanding advances leaving $1.9 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with no outstanding advances. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

Our contingency funding plans incorporate several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates we are charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting net interest margins and net interest spreads. 

&#8203; 

Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of September 30, 2020, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

&#8203; 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for loan losses of the Company, or $820.4 million at September 30, 2020. Based on this criteria, we had six such credit concentrations at September 30, 2020, including loans on hotels and motels of $959.4 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $3.8 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings of $966.3 million, loans 

&#160; 

secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $2.0 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.0 billion and loans secured by 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $3.8 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.

With some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At September 30, 2020, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 54.1% and its CRE concentration ratio was 236.2%. As of September 30, 2020, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank Management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

&#8203; 

Previous to the adoption of the new guidelines established in 2020, the guidelines for the construction, land development and other land loans were to total less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for total commercial real estate loans to total less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Both ratios were calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 the Bank&#8217;s construction, land development and other land loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 68.7% and 70.4%, respectively. Commercial real estate loans (which includes construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 225.6% and 233.4% as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively.
