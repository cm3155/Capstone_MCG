As of June 30, 2020 and the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that we are not party to, nor is any or our property the subject of, any pending material legal proceeding other than those that may occur in the ordinary course of our business. The previously disclosed SEC investigation involving CSFL has been terminated by the SEC without enforcement action recommended.
