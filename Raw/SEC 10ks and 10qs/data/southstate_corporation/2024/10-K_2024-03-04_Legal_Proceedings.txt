 Item 3. Legal Proceedings . 

We or our Bank subsidiary is periodically a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business, such as claims to enforce liens, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans, and other issues incident to our products and services and our businesses. We do not believe any pending or threatened legal proceedings in the ordinary course against the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.
