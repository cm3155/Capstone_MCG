Overview 

&#8203; 

SouthState is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState|Duncan Williams Securities Corp., a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor. SSB First Street Corporation, an investment subsidiary of the Bank headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, holds tax-exempt municipal investment securities as part of the Bank&#8217;s investment portfolio. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2024, we had approximately $45.5 billion in assets and 5,189 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Walnut Creek, California, and Birmingham, Alabama. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate Corporate Billing, a transaction-based division of the Bank headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide.

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, and also analyzes our financial condition as of June 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such, we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 &#8212; Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

The following is a summary of our ACL critical accounting policy, which is highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect. Management has a methodology determining its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded on the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures&#8221; in this MD&#38;A. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macroeconomic forecasts from the third-party service provider. Changes in the economic forecasts may significantly affect the estimated credit losses which may potentially lead to materially different quantitatively modeled allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. SouthState uses a third-party service provider to support the economic forecast assumptions under CECL forecast by providing various levels of economic scenarios. These scenarios are weighted in accordance with management assessment of scenarios as well as expectations of the general market and industry conditions. To illustrate the sensitivity of these scenarios, if a 100% probability weighting was applied to the adverse scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach, this would result in an increase in the ACL by approximately $213.9 million (all other things equal, including no compensating adjustments to qualitative factor adjustments). Conversely, if a 100% probability weighting was applied to the upside scenario, this would result in a decrease in the ACL by approximately $98.2 million. The adverse scenario includes assumptions including, but not limited to, elevated interest rates weakening consumers and public confidence, inflation, the Russian invasion of Ukraine persisting longer than expected and conflict in the Middle East leading to a wider war, tensions between China and Taiwan interrupt trade, political risks, increased unemployment and the U.S. economy falling into recession in 2024. Conversely, the upside scenario includes assumptions such as a swift resolution of international conflicts, stabilization of consumer confidence, more than full employment, reduced political tensions, and other favorable assumptions. This sensitivity analysis and related impact on the ACL is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management&#8217;s judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at June 30, 2024.

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $132.4 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.73, for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to consolidated net income of $123.4 million, or diluted EPS of $1.62, in the comparable period of 2023, a 7.2% increase in consolidated net income and a 6.8% increase in diluted EPS. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we reported consolidated net income of $247.4 million, or diluted EPS of $3.23, as compared to consolidated net income of $263.4 million, or diluted EPS of $3.45, in the comparable period of 2023, a 6.1% decrease in consolidated net income and a 6.4% decrease in diluted EPS. The $8.9 million increase in consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $53.1 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $59.0 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in interest income from investment securities, and a $3.6 million decrease in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest income from loans was due to an increase in the yield of 43 basis points as loans continued to reprice higher from the rising rate environment in 2022 and in 2023 as the Federal Reserve Bank raised its federal funds rate by 525 basis points. The increase in interest income was also due to an increase in the average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, of $1.9 billion through organic loan growth; &#9679; A $64.6 million increase in interest expense, which resulted from a $64.7 million increase in interest expense from deposits, a $1.5 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings. The increase in interest expense from deposits resulted mainly from an increase in costs due to the higher interest rate environment with the increase in interest rates in 2022 and 2023. This increase in average cost of deposits was felt throughout 2023 starting with the stress in the financial markets and liquidity that occurred in March 2023 with the closure of a few failed financial institutions. The average cost of deposits, excluding noninterest-bearing deposits, increased by 87 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2023; &#9679; An $34.5 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, as the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 while recording a provision for credit losses of $38.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a lower provision for credit losses as economic forecasts improved since the second quarter of 2023, with inflation falling and interest rates stabilizing, along with lower new loan growth in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023; &#9679; A $2.0 million decrease in noninterest income due to a decline in correspondent banking and capital market income of $14.3 million. This decrease was mostly offset by an increase in fees on deposit accounts of $741,000, in mortgage banking income of $1.6 million, in trust and investment services income of $1.3 million, in SBA income of $1.1 million, in bank owned life insurance income of $1.1 million and in other noninterest income of $6.6 million. The increase in other noninterest income is mainly attributable to $5.2 million in income from tax refunds during the second quarter of 2024. See Noninterest Income section on page 57 for further discussion; &#9679; A $6.1 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $4.1 million, in merger, branch consolidation, severance related and other expense of $4.0 million, in advertising and marketing of $1.1 million, in OREO and loan related expense of $1.3 million and an information services expense of $2.0 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges, excluding the special FDIC assessment allocated to the Bank, of $2.0 million, amortization of intangibles of $1.3 million and other noninterest expense of $3.1 million. The decrease in other noninterest expense is mainly related to a release in accrued expense for an uncertain tax position (&#8220;UTP&#8221;) of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. See Noninterest Expense section on page 59 for further discussion; and &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; Higher income tax provision of $6.0 million due to higher pretax book income between the two quarters. The Company recorded pretax book income of $172.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to pretax book income of $157.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was also due to the effects of the Company adopting ASU 2023-02 in the first quarter of 2024 whereby it applied the proportional amortization method of accounting related to its low-income housing tax credits partnerships (&#8220;LIHTC&#8221;). With the adoption of ASU 2023-02, the amortization of the LIHTCs is now recorded within Provision for Income Taxes rather than Other Noninterest Expense on the Statement of Income. The amortization for the Company&#8217;s LIHTCs totaled $3.5 million during the second quarter of 2024. The change in the accounting method, in addition to other items recorded during the current quarter, increased our effective tax rate for the second quarter in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate was 23.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 21.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. See Income Tax Expense section on page 60 for further discussion. &#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to 57.0% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 53.6% in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the second quarter of 2023 was the result of an 3.1% decrease in the total of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income along with a 3.0% increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles). This decrease was reflective of a 55.5% increase in interest expense as the repricing of interest-bearing liabilities caught up with the repricing of interest-earning assets in 2023 and 2024 resulting from the rising rate environment. The increase in noninterest expense was reflective of a 2.8% increase in salaries and employee benefits and a 220.0% increase in merger and branch consolidation related expense mostly related to the proposed merger with Independent. 

&#8203; 

Basic and diluted EPS were $1.74 and $1.73, respectively for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $1.62 for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in basic and diluted EPS was due to a 7.2% increase in net income in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The effects from the increase in net income were partially offset by an increase in average basic common shares of 0.3%. The increase in net income in the second quarter of 2024 was mainly attributable to a decrease in provision for credit losses during the second quarter of 2024.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the return on average assets increased compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income of $8.9 million, or 7.2%, which was mainly attributable to a decrease in the provision for credit losses cost as economic forecasts improved since the second quarter of 2023, with inflation falling and interest rates stabilizing, along with lower new loan growth in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The effects on the return on average assets from the increase in net income were partially offset by an increase in average assets of 1.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from the same period in 2023 mainly due to an increase in average loans of $1.8 billion through organic growth. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the return on average assets decreased as net income was lower by $15.9 million, or 6.1%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, mainly due to a decline in net interest income of $48.8 million as the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased resulting from the rising rate environment. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the return on average equity increased compared to the same periods in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher net income of 7.2% partially offset by the effects from an increase in average equity of 4.8%. The increase in net income was mainly attributable to lower provision for credit losses. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the return on average equity decreased primarily due to lower net income of $15.9 million, or 6.1%, along with an increase in average equity of $305.8 million, or 5.8%. The decline in net income was due to the decline in the net interest margin from higher interest expense and the increase in average equity was due to net income earned from June 30, 2023. &#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the return on average tangible equity declined compared to the same periods in 2023. This decrease was due to the increase in average tangible equity of 8.5% being greater than the increase in net income adjusted for amortization of intangibles of 6.1%. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the return on average tangible equity decreased due to lower net income adjusted for amortization of intangibles of $18.2 million, or 6.6% along with an increase in average tangible equity of $332.2 million, or 10.4%. &#9679; The equity to assets ratios was 12.42% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 0.65% from June 30, 2023. This increase resulted from the effects of the net income earned during the last twelve months being greater than the increase in total assets of 1.2% from June 30, 2023. &#9679; Dividend payout ratios were 29.93% and 32.02% for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2024, respectively, and 30.75% and 28.81% for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the dividend payout ratio for the three months period ending June 30, 2024, was due to the 7.2% increase in net income being greater than the increase in dividends paid during the current quarter of 4.4% compared to the same period in 2023. The dividend payout ratio for the six months period ending June 30, 2024, increased due to lower net income of 6.1% along the effects from an increase in total dividends paid of 4.4% when compared to the same period in 2023. Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Non-Tax Equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest income decreased $11.5 million, or 3.2%, to $350.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $361.7 million in the same period in 2023. Interest-earning assets averaged $41.0 billion during the three months period ended June 30, 2024, compared to $40.1 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of $883.8 million, or 2.2%. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $27.7 billion during the three months period ended June 30, 2024, compared to $26.0 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 6.6% . Non-TE net interest income decreased $48.8 million, or 6.6%, to $694.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $743.0 million in the same period in 2023. Interest-earning assets averaged $40.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $39.8 billion during the same period in 2023. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $27.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $25.3 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 9.0%. 

&#8203; 

The Federal Reserve made four 25 basis-point rate increases during 2023, starting early February 2023 with the last increase in late July 2023, resulting in a range of 5.25% to 5.50% at June 30, 2024. As a result, the Company operated under a higher rate environment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, while it operated under a comparatively lower rate environment in the same time periods in 2023. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Both the non-TE and TE net interest margin decreased by 19 basis points and 18 basis points, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023 due to the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 84 basis points outweighing the increase in the yield on interest earning assets of 43 basis points. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities lagged the increase in yield on interest-earning assets during this rising interest rate cycle and has caught up in the latter half of 2023 and into 2024 . o Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2024 increased 43 basis points to 5.21% from the comparable period in 2023 due to higher yields on the majority of interest-earning assets, including loans held for investment, investments securities, and loans held for sale, as the Federal Reserve Bank interest rate hikes during 2023 continue to impact these rates. The increases in interest rates, in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of $1.8 billion, the decline in the average balances of lower yielding investment securities of $767.7 million, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. &#8203; 

&#160; 

o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the second quarter of 2024 increased 84 basis points from the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by the effects from the higher rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts, federal funds purchased, securities purchased with agreement to repurchase, trust preferred corporate debt, and other borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 88 basis points as the cost increase occurred in all deposit categories and was a result of the rising rate environment and a change in the deposit mix. Our deposits have shifted from lower-costing savings and transaction to higher-costing money market accounts as the customers have sought higher yields during the rising rate environment. The average balance of transaction deposit accounts decreased by $547.8 million, and savings accounts decreased by $526.3 million, while average balance of money market account increased by $3.0 billion for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

(1) Investment securities (taxable) and (tax-exempt) include trading securities. Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

The interest earned on investment securities decreased by $2.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of investment securities decreased $767.7 million and $766.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, from the comparable periods in 2023. The yield on the investment securities increased 13 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the rising rate environment. While the Bank reduced the size of its investment securities portfolio, the yield on the investment securities increased due to higher interest rates in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, resulting in higher interest income earned in 2024. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on loans held for investment increased $58.6 million to $477.3 million and increased $128.6 million to $940.3 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, from the comparable periods in 2023. Interest earned on loans held for investment included loan accretion income recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 of $4.4 million, $8.7 million, $5.5 million and $12.9 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Some key highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, are outlined below:

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans increased 43 basis points in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a 52 basis-point increase in the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio and a 23 basis-point increase in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio. o The yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased from 6.08% in the second quarter of 2023 to 6.31% in the same period in 2024, while interest income on the acquired loan portfolio declined by $18.2 million during the same period. &#9726; The interest income on acquired loans decreased by $18.2 million, due to a $1.4 billion decrease in average balance during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average balance decreased due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The effect from the decline in average acquired loans balance was partially offset by the increase in yield of 23 basis points. o The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased 52 basis points to 5.72% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 5.20% in the same period in 2023. Interest income on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased $76.7 million during the same period. &#9726; The increases in both yield and interest income on non-acquired loans were attributable to both an increase in the average loan balance of $3.2 billion during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio, along with a higher yield of 52 basis points due to the higher rate environment . &#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.7 billion, or 6.6%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 84 basis points to 2.63% and the overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, increased by 67 basis points to 1.90% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Some key highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.52% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2023. o Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $64.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to interest expense on transaction and money market accounts and certificate and other time deposits increased. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts and certificates and other time deposits increased by $55.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, while interest expense on savings slightly declined by $121,000. One factor driving the increase in average cost and interest expense was the repricing of deposits in the higher rate environment in 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits lagged the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets during this rising interest rate cycle and has caught up in the latter half of 2023 and into the first half of 2024. o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $1.9 billion, primarily due to a $2.4 billion average balance increase of transaction and money market accounts, which drove up interest expense. The increase in the average balance of transaction and money market accounts was partially offset by a decrease in the average saving deposits of $526.3 million and a decrease in the average balance of certificates and other time deposits of $41.4 million. &#9679; The cost of federal funds purchased increased 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2024 due to the rising rate environment. This increase in cost along with the increase in the average balance of $54.9 million drove the $931,000 increase in interest expense compared to the same period in 2023. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; The cost of repurchase agreements was 2.02% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 1.03% for the same period in 2023. The effects from the increase in the cost of repurchase agreements, partially offset by the effects from a decline in the average balance of $59.3 million, drove the increase in the interest expense of $517,000 during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. &#9679; The cost on the corporate and subordinated debt increased by 20 basis points to 6.16% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, also driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate corporate debentures. The interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures increased by $176,000 during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the increase in average cost. &#9679; The cost of other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was 5.47% and interest expense was $4.4 million compared to 5.22% and $6.2 million during the second quarter of 2023. The decline in interest expense was due to a decline in the average balance of other borrowings of $150.0 million to $323.6 million during the second quarter of 2024 compared to $473.6 million during the same period in 2023. &#8203; 

We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, Interest on Lawyers&#8217; Trust Accounts (&#8220;IOLTA&#8221;), and Market Rate checking accounts. 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $1.4 billion, or 11.5%, to $10.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $11.9 billion during the same period in 2023. The decrease in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits was due to customers moving funds from noninterest bearing checking accounts to interest bearing checking accounts seeking higher yields resulting from the rising rate environment, along with customers having less excess cash as funds from government support programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic began to decline.

Noninterest income decreased slightly by $2.0 million, or 2.6%, during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This quarterly change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $1.6 million, or 35.8%, during the current quarter compared to the same period of the prior year, which was comprised of a $1.9 million, or 68.0%, increase in secondary market mortgage income, slightly offset by a $387,000, or 25.9%, decrease in mortgage servicing related income. Mortgage production declined from $696 million in the second quarter of 2023 to $552 million in the second quarter of 2024 with higher mortgage rates continuing during 2024. The Company allocated a higher percentage of mortgage production to the secondary market in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as the percentage allocated increased from 38% to 59%. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate year to year. o Mortgage income from the secondary market increased by $1.9 million between the comparable periods resulting from a $1.1 million increase in the fair value of loans held for sale, a $790,000 increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, and the change in fair value of the pipeline of $532,000, offset by a decrease in the fair value of MBS forward trades of $454,000. Mortgage commission expense was $3.3 million during the second quarter of 2024 compared to $2.3 million during the comparable period in 2023. o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the second quarter of 2024 was due to a $488,000 decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay, offset by a $101,000 increase in service fee income. The decrease in fair value of the MSR between the comparable periods was primarily due to a decrease in the change in fair value from interest rates of $1.1 million and a $181,000 decline in MSR decay, offset by an increase from gains/losses on the MSR hedge of $840,000. &#9679; Trust and investment services income for the second quarter of 2024 increased by $1.3 million, or 12.9%, from the second quarter of 2023, as assets under management have increased by $972.9 million, or 12.9%. &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income in the second quarter of 2024 decreased by $14.3 million, or 74.7%, compared to the same quarter in 2023. The decline was primarily related to a decrease of $11.5 million in income generated from the sale of customer swap ARC hedges during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023 resulting from the higher interest rate environment in 2024. The decline was also due to a $2.9 million increase in the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps where we recorded an expense of $11.4 million related to variation margin payments in the second quarter of 2024 compared to an expense of $8.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, other operational fee income was lower by $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. &#9679; SBA income increased by $1.1 million, or 37.1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans. The increase was attributable to higher gains on sale of SBA loans of $854,000 and the change in fair value of the SBA servicing asset of $259,000. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $1.1 million, or 17.6%, during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher death proceeds on BOLI policies received during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. &#9679; Other income increased by $6.6 million, or 414.3%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to approximately $5.2 million of income recognized from federal tax refunds received during the second quarter of 2024 for net operating loss carrybacks filed in 2021. &#8203; 

Noninterest income decreased by $1.8 million, or 1.2% , during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The categories and explanations for the fluctuations year-to-date, except the items discussed below, are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2024 by $2.7 million, or 6.3%, compared to 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to a $2.0 million increase in NSF fees and a $771,000 increase in service charge account maintenance fees in 2024 compared to 2023. &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $1.3 million, or 6.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in debit, ATM, prepaid and merchant card related income was mainly due to higher card and ATM system related expense of $1.3 million. &#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $3.4 million, or 39.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023, which comprised of a $2.8 million, or 50.4%, increase in secondary market mortgage income and a $563,000, or 18.4%, increase in mortgage servicing related income. Mortgage production declined from $1.3 billion in the first half of 2023 to $981 million in the first half of 2024 with higher mortgage rates continuing during 2024. We allocated a higher percentage of mortgage production to the secondary market in 2024 compared to 2023 from 34% to 57%. o Mortgage income from the secondary market increased by $2.8 million between the comparable periods resulting from a $1.0 million increase in the fair value of MBS forward trades, a $942,000 increase in the fair value of loans held for sale, a $795,000 increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, and the change in fair value of the pipeline of $83,000. Mortgage commission expense was $5.5 million in 2024 compared to $3.6 million in 2023. o The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in 2024 was due to a $428,000 increase in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay and a $135,000 increase in service fee income. The increase in fair value of the MSR between the comparable periods was primarily due to an increase in the change in fair value from interest rates of $2.5 million, offset by a $1.9 million decrease from gains/losses on the MSR hedge and a $214,000 decline in MSR decay. &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2024 decreased by $23.6 million, or 72.0%, compared to 2023. The decline was primarily related to a decrease of $17.8 million in income generated from the sale of customer swap ARC hedges in 2024 compared to 2023 resulting from the higher interest rate environment in 2024. The decline was also due to the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps where we recorded an expense of $21.7 million related to variation margin payments in the 2024 compared to an expense of $16.9 million in 2023. In addition, other operational fee income was lower by $1.2 million in 2024 compared to 2023. &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting, increased by $1.7 million, or 25.9% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gains on sale of SBA loans of $1.7 million. &#9679; Other income increased by $9.8 million, or 211.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase was due to approximately $5.2 million in income recognized on federal tax refunds received during the second quarter of 2024 for net operating loss carrybacks filed in 2021, the Bank recognizing approximately $3.0 million in credits from an external vendor in 2024, and approximately $876,000 resulting from the release of accrued expense attributable to UTPs. &#8203;

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $6.1 million, or 2.5%, in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Salaries and employee benefits increased $4.1 million, or 2.8%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in incentive expenses of $3.8 million, an increase in salaries of $1.8 million resulting from merit increases, along with higher employee benefits of $1.4 million due to higher FICA tax and medical insurance expense. &#9679; These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commissions of $3.0 million, which is mainly attributable to lower commissions related to the correspondent banking division resulting from lower bond sales and lower income from the ARC hedging program. &#9679; Information services expense increased $2.0 million, or 9.6%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. &#160; The increase was due to additional costs associated with the Company updating systems and software as it grows in size and complexity . &#9679; OREO and loan related expense increased to $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to OREO and loan related recovery of $14,000 in the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an $862,000 increase in losses from the sales of OREO and other repossessed assets and a $445,000 increase in Special Assets Management (&#8220;SAM&#8221;) related expenses including legal, tax and other costs. &#9679; Amortization of intangibles, which is related to the Company&#8217;s prior mergers, decreased $1.3 million, or 18.3%. &#9679; Advertising and marketing expense increased $1.1 million, or 70.5%, in the second quarter 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to media advertising production and placement related costs incurred in the second quarter of 2024. &#9679; Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense increased $4.0 million, or 220.0%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Of the $4.0 million in 2024, approximately $3.5 million pertains to one-time costs associated with the cybersecurity incident, which was identified as an isolated event as previously disclosed by the Company. The Company also incurred approximately $2.5 million expenses associated with the previously announced acquisition of Independent during the second quarter of 2024, while it had a total of $963,000 merger expense associated with the Atlantic Capital acquisition during the comparative period in 2023. These increases were offset by a reduction in the restructuring costs of approximately $1.1 million. &#9679; Other noninterest expense decreased $3.0 million, or 16.3%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from a $2.1 million decline in amortization expenses related to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024, and a $2.0 million decrease in other miscellaneous operational expenses . In addition, a UTP adjustment for approximately $2.0 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2024. These decreases were offset by a $3.7 million increase in earnings credit expense to Homeowners Association (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) customers. The Bank provides a credit to HOA customers based on the average deposit balances held that reduces fees for other services provided. &#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest expense increased by $14.9 million, or 3.1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The categories and explanations for the fluctuations year-to-date, except the items discussed below, are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. 

&#9679; Occupancy expense increased $1.3 million, or 3.0%. The increase was primarily due to increases in branch maintenance, insurance, tax and lease related expenses. &#9679; Professional fees decreased $1.0 million, or 13.0%, primarily due to lower legal and other general business consulting expenses incurred in 2024 compared to 2023. &#9679; The Company accrued a total of $4.5 million in 2024 related to the FDIC&#8217;s special assessment introduced in 2023 to recover losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from the bank failures that occurred in early 2023. The Bank increased its accrual of the FDIC special assessment during 2024 in anticipation of the higher assessment that may be allocated to the Bank as the estimate of the losses expected from the bank failures were larger than originally estimated. &#9679; Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense increased by $7.2 million, or 230.2%, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to approximately $7.9 million one-time costs associated with the cybersecurity incident. Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 23.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 21.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the effective rate for the quarter, when compared to the same period in the prior year, is driven by amortization of LIHTCs as a result of the adoption of the proportional amortization under ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024, as well as an increase in disallowed interest expense, and non-deductible merger expenses recorded during the current period. This was partially offset by a decrease in disallowed executive compensation . 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate for the first six months of the year was 24.19% compared to 21.84% for the first six months of 2023. The increase in the year-to-date effective tax rate compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily driven by amortization of LIHTC investments, an increase in disallowed interest expense, partially offset by an increase in tax-exempt interest income and an increase in federal tax credits available. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $2.8 million in income tax provision during the first quarter of 2024 related to the revaluation of its deferred income taxes and other tax adjustments. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Summary 

Our total assets increased approximately $591.9 million, or 1.3%, from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024, to approximately $45.5 billion. Within total assets, cash and cash equivalents increased by $118.3 million, or 11.8% and loans increased $846.1 million, or 2.6%, while investment securities decreased $415.6 million, or 5.6%, during the period. Within total liabilities, deposit grew $49.5 million, or 0.1%, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by $53.2 million, or 10.9%. Total borrowings increased by $199.8 million, or 40.6%. Total shareholder&#8217;s equity increased $117.3 million, or 2.1%. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the increase in borrowings of $199.8 million along with decline in investments of $415.6 million from maturities and pay downs of mortgage-backed securities. The increase in borrowings was due to a net increase in FHLB advances of $200.0 million from December 31, 2023. These increases in funding sources were mostly offset by the increase in loans which was due to normal organic growth. Our loan to deposit ratio was 90% and 87% at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, while our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to total deposits was 28% and 29%, respectively at June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements, derivative exposures and to augment borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At June 30, 2024, investment securities totaled $7.0 billion, compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $415.6 million, or 5.6%. At June 30, 2024, approximately 63.8% of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale, approximately 33.3% was classified as held to maturity and approximately 2.9% was classified as other investments. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we purchased $95.0 million of capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta classified as other investment securities on the balance sheet of which we sold back $85.5 million. The net decrease to the capital stock holding for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $9.5 million during the six months of 2024 was due to the decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Bank purchased $13.0 million of available for sale securities. There were maturities, paydowns, and calls of investment securities totaling $378.6 million during the six months of 2024. Net amortization of premiums was $9.7 million in the first six months of 2024. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2024, the unrealized net losses of the available for sale securities portfolio was $826.4 million, or 15.5%, below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of $776.6 million, or 14.0%, at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, the unrealized net losses of the held to maturity securities portfolio was $427.6 million, or 18.2%, below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of $402.7 million, or 16.2%, at December 31, 2023. 

&#8203; 

The following is the combined amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held for maturity, aggregated by credit quality indicator:

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

At June 30, 2024 , we had 1,232 investment securities including both available for sale and held to maturity, in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.3 billion. At December 31, 2023, we had 1,232 investment securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity, in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.2 billion. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position remained unchanged, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss increased by $73.5 million. The level of unrealized losses for each period is due to an overall increase in short- and long-term interest rates in 2022 and 2023 and the expectation that interest rates will not fall until late 2024 or 2025. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2024 , continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability and intent to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of our securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 &#8212; Investment Securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. From time to time, the Bank may execute transactions to reposition the investment portfolio. Such activity has not expanded the broad asset classes used by the Bank. While management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of June 30, 2024, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of June 30, 2024, other investment securities represented app rox imately $201.5 million, or 0.44% of total assets, and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $182.6 million, or 0.40% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Trading Securities 

&#8203; 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Banking Division and the Bank&#8217;s subsidiary, SouthState|Duncan Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Markets Income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $92.2 million and $31.3 million, respectively, at June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Loans Held for Sale 

&#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale increased $49.1 million from December 31, 2023, to $100.0 million on June 30, 2024. Total mortgage production was $552 million in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $429 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $696 million in the second quarter of 2023. Mortgage production has declined in 2024 as mortgage rates have continued to remain high. The percentage of mortgage production sold into the secondary market increased in the second quarter of 2024 to 59% from 53% in the first quarter of 2024. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate over time.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $846.1 million, or 5.3% annualized, to $33.2 billion at June 30, 2024. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $1.5 billion, or 11.7% annualized, mainly driven by organic growth. Commercial non-owner-occupied loans, consumer owner-occupied loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial owner-occupied real estate, and home equity loans led the way with $772.5 million, $414.5 million, $414.0 million, $172.2 million and $99.0 million in year-to-date loan growth, respectively, or 24.3%, 14.1%, 18.1%, 8.6% and 17.4% annualized growth, respectively. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $695.1 million, or 23.7% annualized. This decline in acquired loans was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The main categories that declined were commercial non-owner-occupied loans, commercial and industrial loans and commercial owner-occupied loans, which decreased by $237.4 million, $148.7 million and $146.9 million, respectively, year-to-date. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 15.7% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio increased to 84.3% at June 30, 2024. This compares to acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 18.2% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 81.8% at December 31, 2023. 

&#8203; 

Total commercial non-owner-occupied loans of $9.1 billion, approximately 27.4% of the total loans held for investment, was the largest category of the loan portfolio as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 94% of the commercial non-owner-occupied portfolio was located within the Company&#8217;s footprint. Of the $9.1 billion, approximately $1.3 billion, or 4% of the total loans, represented our office segment. Approximately 95% of the office segment was located in the Company&#8217;s footprint and approximately 10% was located within the metropolitan or central business district. The weighted average Debt Service Coverage (&#8220;DSC&#8221;) was 1.47x and the loan-to-value was 58%. For additional discussion around classified commercial non-owner-occupied loans, refer to the &#8220;Nonperforming Assets&#8221; section in this MD&#38;A. 

&#8203; 

The following table presents the top eight loan segments of the commercial non-owner-occupied loan category (excluding loans held for sale). The loan segments in the table below are determined by the call code, used for the Bank&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements issued by the FDIC for the FFIEC 041, also referred to as the Call Report.

(1) Net book balance in each segment that represents 2% or more of commercial non-owner-occupied portfolio as of June 30, 2024. (2) Weighted average DSC information from the Company&#8217;s December 31, 2023 stress test using commitment balances, totaling approximately $5.4 billion. The Weighted average DSC information excludes loans below $1.5 million, unless part of a larger relationship. (3) Weighted-average Loan-to-Value as of June 30, 2024. Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. Please see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the &#8220;ACL &#8211; Loans&#8221; section, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 2 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL on loans. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict and unrest in middle east, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the Bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses an eight-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

In spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycle-to-date, the U.S. has thus far avoided a recession, although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession. Management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline, upside, and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. For the quarter ending June 30, 2024, management selected a baseline weighting of 40%, a 30% weighting for an upside scenario and a 30% weighting for the more severe scenario. In the prior quarter, scenario weightings were 50% on baseline and 25% each on the upside and downside scenarios. The scenario weightings were changed to align to best practices for probability weighted forecast scenarios and do not represent a significant shift in management&#8217;s economic outlook. Scenario weightings are generally expected to remain stable but are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation, high interest rates, and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession. While employment figures still show resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels, continued projected borrower weakness related to high interest rates result in elevated modeled expected losses. The resulting provision was approximately $3.9 million during the second quarter of 2024. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Please see MD&#38;A, under the &#8220;Financial Condition&#8221;, &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;)&#8221; section, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL on certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 

&#8203; 

As of June 30, 2024, the balance of the ACL was $472.3 million or 1.42% of total loans. The ACL increased $2.6 million from the balance of $469.7 million recorded at March 31, 2024. This increase during the second quarter of 2024 included $6.9 million provision and $4.2 million net charge-offs. During the first six months of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses based on loan growth and current forecasts applied to our modeling to adequately capture potential economic recessionary risks.

&#8203; 

As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the second quarter of 2024, updates were made to certain estimates used in the Company&#8217;s current expected credit loss model. While the total allowance and coverage of total loans remain the same, reserves at the loan segment level were updated due the expansion of macroeconomic variables. Although portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans or pools of loans, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management&#8217;s judgment, should be charged off. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2024, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $50.2 million, which was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared to $53.2 million at March 31, 2024, and $56.3 million at December 31, 2023. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $3.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively. For the prior comparative period, the Company recorded a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $21.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively, during three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financial asset during the first six months of 2024. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

The ACL provides 2.41 times coverage of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. Net charge-offs to total average loans during three and six months ended June 30, 2024, were 0.05% and 0.04%, respectively, compared to net charge-offs to total average loans of 0.04% and 0.03%, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. We continued to experience solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of June 30, 2024.

(1) Consists of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure. (2) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (3) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). (4) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (5) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (6) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $6.1 million, $9.0 million, $9.0 million, $11.8 million, and $10.0 million as of June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. (7) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $0, $0, $3.4 million, $3.4 million, and $3.4 million as of June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, and June 30, 2023 , respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. 

&#160; 

Total nonperforming assets were $199.3 million, or 0.60% of total loans and repossessed assets, at June 30, 2024, an increase of $15.2 million, or 8.2%, from December 31, 2023. Total nonperforming loans were $195.8 million, or 0.59%, of total loans, at June 30, 2024, an increase of $13.1 million, or 7.2%, from December 31, 2023. Non-acquired nonperforming loans decreased by $5.2 million from December 31, 2023. T he decrease in non-acquired nonperforming loans was driven primarily by a decrease in commercial nonaccrual loans of $16.1 million, a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $5.5 million, offset by an increase in consumer nonaccrual loans of $7.9 million and restructured nonaccrual loans of $8.5 million. The accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased by $5.5 million at June 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of factored receivables, which are trade credits rather than promissory notes loans that are deemed to be low risk . The increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of $8.5 million was due to one commercial loan that was modified under a term extension agreement. Acquired nonperforming loans increased $18.3 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due primarily to an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $13.9 million, an increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of $5.9 million, offset by a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $1.3 million and a decline in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $300,000. The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $13.9 million was primarily due to one commercial non-owner-occupied real estate loan for $12.5 million. 

As discussed previously under the &#8220;Loans&#8221; section in this MD&#38;A, commercial non-owner-occupied loans represented the largest category of the loan portfolio as of June 30, 2024. We continued to experience solid and stable asset quality for these loans as of June 30, 2024 as approximately 0.2% of the total commercial non-owner-occupied loans were on non-accrual. In addition, approximately 5.4% and 2.0% of the total commercial non-owner-occupied loans were classified as substandard and still accruing, and special mention, respectively. Majority of these classified assets are mainly related to debt service coverage policy violations as interest rates have risen. However, most of these loans are still performing, are strongly collateralized and have strong borrowers supporting the loans. For additional information on the Company&#8217;s monitoring process for classified loans and a description of the general characteristics of the risk grades, refer to Note 6 &#8212; Loans in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, Interest on Layers&#8217; Trust Accounts (&#8220;IOLTA&#8221;), and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Total interest-bearing deposits increased $324.3 million, or 2.5% annualized, to $26.7 billion at June 30, 2024, from $26.4 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase mainly driven by growth in money market accounts of $583.7 million, including $189.7 million in reciprocal insured money market deposits and in time deposits of $329.1 million. This increase was partially offset by declines in interest-bearing checking accounts of $431.4 million and savings deposits of $157.1 million. Customers continue to move funds from lower yielding deposit products seeking higher yields in money market accounts and time deposits. Federal funds purchased related to the Correspondent Banking Division and securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $542.4 million at June 30, 2024, a $53.2 million increase from December 31, 2023. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased to $300.0 million at June 30, 2024 from $100.0 million at December 31, 2023. Corporate and subordinated debentures declined by $185,000 to $391.7 million. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#9679; As noted above, the Company&#8217;s higher yielding money market accounts and time deposits increased during the first half of 2024. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials) due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $1.9 billion to $26.4 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. For more information on the composition of our total deposits, see Note 9 &#8211; Deposits. &#9679; Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased $200.0 million to $300.0 million at June 30, 2024, from $100.0 million at December 31, 2023. The Company borrowed additional FHLB borrowings in the first half of 2024 to provide additional liquidity. &#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. At June 30, 2024, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits of $10.4 billion declined slightly compared to the balance at December 31, 2023, of $10.6 billion. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $10.6 billion for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $11.9 billion for the second quarter of 2023. This decrease in the average noninterest bearing deposits from the quarter ended June 30, 2023, was mainly due to customers seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment. Also, customers have less excess cash as funds from government support programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic began to decline, as well as the resulting effects of higher costs related to inflation. 

Uninsured Deposits 

At June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $13.2 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively, in estimated uninsured deposits. The amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements issued by the FDIC for the FFIEC 041, also referred to as the Call Report. 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of June 30, 2024, shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.7 billion, an increase of $117.3 million, or 2.1%, from December 31, 2023.

The Company repurchased 100,000 shares, at an average price of $79.85 per share for a total of $8.0 million under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Plan during the first quarter of 2024. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. As of June 30, 2024, a total of 3,920,021 authorized shares remains available for repurchase. 

&#8203; 

Under current regulations, the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum required ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. The minimum required leverage ratio is 4%. The minimum required total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is 8%. Refer to Note 17 &#8212; Capital Ratios for more information regarding Company and Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital compliance requirements. 

&#8203; 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount began the three-year phase out in the first quarter of 2022 with 25% phased out in 2024. At June 30, 2024, approximately $15.3 million was added to Tier 1 capital at the Company and Bank as a result of the modified CECL transition. Had the Company elected not to apply the modified CECL transitional amount to its Tier 1 capital, the Company and Bank would have still been considered well capitalized as of June 30, 2024 .

The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios all improved compared to December 31, 2023. All of these ratios mainly improved due to net income recognized during the first half of 2024 of $247.4 million. Tier 1 capital increased by 3.6% and 3.9% at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity from the net income recognized. Total risk-based capital increased by 3.4% and 3.8% at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity resulting from net income along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments includable in Tier 2 capital. Both regulatory risk-based assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter with average assets for both the Company and Bank increasing by 0.5% and risk-based assets increasing by 0.9%. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

The ALCO has established key risk indicators to monitor liquidity and interest rate risk. The key risk indicators are reviewed and approved by the ALCO on an annual basis. The liquidity key risk indicators include the loan to deposit ratio, net noncore funding dependence ratio, On-hand liquidity to total liabilities ratio, the percentage of securities pledged to total securities, and the ratio of brokered deposits to total deposits. As of June 30, 2024, the Company was operating within its liquidity policy limits. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. 

&#160; 

Overall, total loans increased $846.1 million, or 5.3% annualized in first six months of 2024. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 11.7% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $695.1 million from the balance on December 31, 2023, through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. 

Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) decreased by approximately $415.6 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2023. The decrease in investment securities from December 31, 2023, was a result of maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $464.1 million, a reduction from the net amortization of premiums of $9.7 million, and a decrease in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $49.7 million. This decrease was partially offset by purchases of available for sale investment securities totaling $13.0 million and other investment securities of $95.0 million. There were no purchases of held to maturity securities during 2024. The purchases of other investment securities were related to capital stock with the Federal Home Loan Bank of which we sold back $85.5 million during 2024. The activity in the purchases and sales of the Federal Home Loan Bank Capital Stock was due to activity with FHLB borrowings during the year. The Bank pledges a portion of its investment portfolio for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, collateral for public funds and credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. As of June 30, 2024, the bank pledged 41.2% of the market value of its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment portfolios. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank had unpledged securities with a market value of $3.8 billion. These securities included Treasury, Agency, Agency MBS, Municipals and Corporate securities . 

&#8203; 

Total cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion at June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Liquidity has tightened starting in 2023 with the rising rate environment and turmoil in the financial markets occurring in early 2023. Competition for in-market deposits has increased throughout 2023 and 2024 resulting in increases in deposit rates to retain local deposits. The Bank supplements its in-market deposits with brokered deposits. While the Bank has a policy limit for brokered time deposits of no more than 15% of total deposits, it has operated well below this policy limit. At June 30, 2024, the percentage of brokered time deposits to total deposits was 2.7% compared to 1.9% at December 31, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company also borrowed funds from the FHLB on a short-term basis of $300.0 million. The outstanding borrowings from the FHLB were $100.0 million at December 31, 2023. See below for further discussion around brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings.

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements; federal funds sold; balances at the Federal Reserve Bank; and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. We could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks. The Bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta . 

&#8203; 

Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets, in addition to having access to brokered deposits. Of the $37.1 billion in total deposits at June 30, 2024, approximately 70% were insured or collateralized. The Bank has a granular deposit base comprised of over approximately 1.4 million accounts, with an average deposit size of $27,000. The top ten and twenty deposit relationships comprise approximately 3% and 4% of total deposits, respectively, and approximately 28% of total deposits are non-interest bearing. The Bank&#8217;s deposit beta, which represents the change in the Bank&#8217;s cost of deposits over the change in the federal funds target rate, during this cycle (from March 2022 through June 2024) is approximately 34%. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had $991.4 million and $719.7 million of traditional, out&#8211;of&#8211;market brokered time deposits, respectively . At June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of reciprocal deposits . Total deposits were $37.1 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $49.5 million from $37.0 billion at December 31, 2023 . This change in deposits from December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in money market accounts of $583.7 million, including $189.7 million in reciprocal insured money market deposits and in time deposits of $329.1 million. This increase was partially offset by declines in interest-bearing checking accounts of $431.4 million and savings deposits of $157.1 million. As customers moved funds from noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment, the Company has seen an increase in its balance of higher yielding money market accounts and time deposits during the first quarter of 2024. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials) due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. 

&#8203; 

Total short-term borrowings at June 30, 2024, were $542.4 million, consisting of $288.0 million in federal funds purchased and $254.4 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The Company also held $300.0 million is short term daily rate FHLB advances at June 30, 2024. Total long-term borrowing at June 30, 2024, were $391.7 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise .

&#8203; 

In addition to deposits, we have other primary contingency funding sources available to the Bank. At June 30, 2024, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $6.6 billion, with $300.0 million in FHLB advance outstanding and $2.9 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding at quarter-end, leaving $6.3 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. In addition, our Bank had $1.8 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window and had $2.9 billion in market value of unpledged securities at June 30, 2024, that can be pledged to obtain additional funds, if necessary. All of these resources provide $12.0 billion of additional funding for the Bank. 

&#8203; 

As discussed previously and presented below, the table below compares Primary Funding Sources to uninsured deposits as of June 30, 2024.

The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15% of total deposits which would allow capacity of $5.5 billion as of June 30, 2024. The Bank had $991.4 million of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving $4.6 billion in available capacity. The Bank has federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end and the holding company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at June 30, 2024. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

In addition to adequate liquidity, the Company and Bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as the Company and the Bank were significantly above the required capital levels as of June 30, 2024. The Company&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.72%, 12.08% and 14.43%, respectively, at June 30, 2024. The Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 10.36%, 12.89% and 14.15%, respectively, at June 30, 2024. As permitted, we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from Tier 1, CET 1 and total risk-based capital; however, even if our unrealized losses as of June 30, 2024 in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes, all else being equal, our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

&#160; 

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

&#8203; 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. The assumptions for loan prepayments, deposit decay, and nonstable deposit balances are derived from models that use historical bank data. These models are independently validated. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. While the Bank is continuously refining its modeling methodology, the core principles of the methodology have remained stable over the past two years. 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

The earnings simulation models consider our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 16 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had a series of short-term interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the Company&#8217;s ARC program and its transition from LIBOR to SOFR after June 30, 2023. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 16 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. Our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in 100 basis point increments through 400 basis points. We calculate smaller rate shocks as needed. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. As of June 30, 2024, the Company was operating within its interest rate key risk indicator policy limits. 

During 2023 and the first half of 2024, the beta assumption applied to total deposits increased to reflect changes in deposit mix. From the beginning of the upward rate cycle, our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred and seventy-four basis points. During this period, the federal funds rate has increased 525 basis points. Accordingly, our cycle to date beta has been approximately 34%. Management recognizes the difficulty in using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment. For internal purposes, and based on the deposit mix as of June 30, 2024, the total deposit beta assumption was 34.5%. For internal forecasting, management will apply overlays to certain assumptions to adjust for current market conditions rather than use assumptions modeled over longer periods of time. 

&#8203; 

The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario published in July 2024 as the Base Case Scenario. As of June 30, 2024, the earnings simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 0.9% increase (up 100) and 1.6% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

&#8203; 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At June 30, 2024, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 2.5% decrease and 0.9% increase, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 6.1% decrease and 0.2% decrease, respectively. The interest rate shock analysis results for EVE sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs, and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of June 30, 2024. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon.

Deposit Concentrations 

&#8203; 

As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our deposits concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. The total deposit balances held by top ten and 20 deposit holders were below 5% of the Company&#8217;s average total deposit balances at June 30, 2024. We do not have any foreign deposits. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; to &#8220;Not Rated&#8221;. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of our borrowers&#8217; abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions. 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $1.2 billion at June 30, 2024. Based on this criteria, we had seven such credit concentrations at June 30, 2024, including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $6.1 billion, loans secured by owner-occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.9 billion, loans secured by owner-occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $2.7 billion, loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner-occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $9.4 billion, loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) of $2.6 billion, and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of $2.4 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

After the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner-occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 50.6% and 59.7%, respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 231.0% and 236.5%, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
