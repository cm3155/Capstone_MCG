Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

M&#38;T Bank Corporation

&#160;

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of M&#38;T Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

&#160;

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our 

&#160;

audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

&#160;

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company&#59; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company&#59; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

&#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses &#8211; Commercial Loans and Commercial Real Estate Loans Loss Factors

&#160;

As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses of $1.1 billion, represents management&#8217;s estimate of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio of $90.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial loans and commercial real estate loans comprise a significant portion of the total allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial loans and commercial real estate loans is primarily determined by applying loss factors to groups of loan balances based on loan type and management&#8217;s classification of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans under the Company&#8217;s loan grading system. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss factors include borrower-specific information, levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries, levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans, changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in credit concentrations, and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. 

&#160;

&#160;

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for credit losses &#8211; commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loss factors is a critical audit matter are (i) the application of significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loss factors, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures related thereto, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment was necessary to evaluate the evidence obtained related to the commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loss factors, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. 

&#160;

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses estimation process, including controls over commercial loan and commercial real estate loan loss factors. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining the allowance for credit losses allocated to commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, including testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate and the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and evaluating the reasonableness of the commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loss factors. Evaluating the commercial loan and commercial real estate loan loss factors included evaluating the reasonableness of the impact of borrower-specific information, levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries, levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans, changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in credit concentrations, and observed trends and practices in the banking industry.

M&#38;T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Financial Statements

&#160;

1. Significant accounting policies

M&#38;T Bank Corporation (&#8220;M&#38;T&#8221;) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. Through subsidiaries, M&#38;T provides individuals, corporations and other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail banking services, including loans and deposits, trust, mortgage banking, asset management, insurance and other financial services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses based in those areas. Certain subsidiaries also conduct activities in other areas.

The accounting and reporting policies of M&#38;T and subsidiaries (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant accounting policies are as follows:

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include M&#38;T and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of M&#38;T included in note 25 report investments in subsidiaries under the equity method. Information about some limited purpose entities that are affiliates of the Company but are not included in the consolidated financial statements appears in note 19.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It is generally the Company&#8217;s policy to take possession of collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.

Trading account

Financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading activities are included in &#8220;trading account and foreign exchange gains&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income.

Investment securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity. Investments in other debt securities are classified as available for sale and stated at estimated fair value with unrealized changes in fair value included in &#8220;accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.&#8221; 

&#160;

Investments in equity securities having readily determinable fair values are stated at fair value and, beginning in 2018, unrealized changes in fair value are included in earnings. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Prior to 2018, equity securities with readily determinable fair values were classified as available for sale. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest income. 

Other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of New York.

Individual debt securities are written down through a charge to earnings when declines in value below the cost basis of a security are considered to be other than temporary. In cases where fair value is less than amortized cost and the Company intends to sell a debt security, it is more likely than not to be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. If the Company intends to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis and its fair value. If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss and (b) the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Subsequently, the Company accounts for the other-than-temporarily impaired debt security as if the security had been purchased on the measurement date of the other-than-temporary impairment at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific identification method.

Loans and leases

The Company&#8217;s accounting methods for loans depends on whether the loans were originated by the Company or were acquired in a business combination.

Originated loans and leases 

Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued interest thereon is charged against income when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days, unless management determines that the loan status clearly warrants other treatment. Nonaccrual commercial loans and commercial real estate loans are returned to accrual status when borrowers have demonstrated an ability to repay their loans and there are no delinquent principal and interest payments. Consumer loans not secured by residential real estate are returned to accrual status when all past due principal and interest payments have been paid by the borrower. Loans secured by residential real estate are returned to accrual status when they are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payments of 90 days or less. Loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident that such balances are not fully collectible. For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, charge-offs are recognized after an assessment by credit personnel of the capacity and willingness of the borrower to repay, the estimated value of any collateral, and any other potential 

&#160;

sources of repayment. A charge-off is recognized when, after such assessment, it becomes evident that the loan balance is not fully collectible. For loans secured by residential real estate, the excess of the loan balances over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. Consumer loans are generally charged-off when the loans are 91 to 180 days past due, depending on whether the loan is collateralized and the status of repossession activities with respect to such collateral. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the loan. Net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount as a reduction of loans outstanding. Commitments to sell real estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale recorded in the consolidated balance sheet includes changes in estimated fair market value during the hedge period, typically from the date of close through the sale date. Valuation adjustments made on these loans and commitments are included in &#8220;mortgage banking revenues.&#8221; 

Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying GAAP when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days. Regardless of loan type, the Company considers a loan to be impaired if it qualifies as a troubled debt restructuring. Impaired loans are classified as either nonaccrual or as loans renegotiated at below market rates which continue to accrue interest, provided that a credit assessment of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition results in an expectation of full repayment under the modified contractual terms. Certain loans greater than 90 days delinquent are not considered impaired if they are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment and are generally not considered impaired. Impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. Interest received on impaired loans placed on nonaccrual status is generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if principal is considered fully collectible, recognized as interest income.

Residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally determined through internal or external reviews of the leased property. The Company reviews commercial lease residual values at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments deemed to be other than temporary.

Loans and leases acquired in a business combination 

Loans acquired in a business combination subsequent to December 31, 2008 were initially recorded at fair value with no carry-over of an acquired entity&#8217;s previously established allowance for credit losses. Purchased impaired loans represent specifically identified loans with evidence of credit deterioration for which it was probable at acquisition that the Company would be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments. For purchased impaired loans and other loans acquired at a discount that was, in part, attributable to credit quality, the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value of acquired loans was recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. Subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows required the Company to evaluate the need for additions to the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows resulted first in the recovery of any related allowance for credit losses and then in recognition of additional interest income over the then-remaining lives of the loans.

&#160;

For all other acquired loans, the difference between the fair value and outstanding principal balance of the loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the lives of those loans. Those loans are then accounted for in a manner that is similar to originated loans. 

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents, in management&#8217;s judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is determined by management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily comprised of commercial and residential real property and are included in &#8220;other assets&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet. An in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Upon acquisition of assets taken in satisfaction of a defaulted loan, the excess of the remaining loan balance over the asset&#8217;s estimated fair value less costs to sell is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent declines in value of the assets are recognized as &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income.

Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Capitalized servicing rights

Capitalized servicing assets are included in &#8220;other assets&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet. Separately recognized servicing assets are initially measured at fair value. The Company uses the amortization method to subsequently measure servicing assets. Under that method, capitalized servicing assets are charged to expense in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.

To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance.

&#160;

Sales and securitizations of financial assets

Transfers of financial assets for which the Company has surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as sales. Interests in a sale of financial assets that continue to be held by the Company, including servicing rights, are initially measured at fair value. The fair values of retained debt securities are generally determined through reference to independent pricing information. The fair values of retained servicing rights and any other retained interests are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with those interests and by reference to market prices for similar assets.

Securitization structures typically require the use of special-purpose trusts that are considered variable interest entities. A variable interest entity is included in the consolidated financial statements if the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity&#8217;s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to that entity.

Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, which is either at the same level or one level below an operating segment. Other acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are initially recorded at estimated fair value and are amortized over their estimated lives. Core deposit and other intangible assets are generally amortized using accelerated methods over estimated useful lives of five to ten years . The Company periodically assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of core deposit and other intangible assets may be impaired.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available-for-sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements, amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items are recorded in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and, beginning in 2018, is recorded in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the derivative&#8217;s unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Prior to 2018, hedge ineffectiveness for fair value and cash flow hedges was recorded in &#8220;other revenues from operations&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. In addition, for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative&#8217;s unrealized gain or loss was initially recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affected earnings. 

&#160;

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value. 

Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking activities, including financial futures commitments and interest rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting requirements are recorded at fair value and are generally classified as trading account assets or liabilities with resultant changes in fair value being recognized in &#8220;trading account and foreign exchange gains&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income.

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the stock-based grant based on the estimated grant date value of the stock-based compensation, except that the recognition of compensation costs is accelerated for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because the Company&#8217;s incentive compensation plan allows for vesting at the time an employee retires.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws.

The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions using the two-step process required by GAAP. The first step requires a determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Under the second step, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company accounts for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method. Under that method, the Company amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per common share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (exclusive of shares represented by the unvested portion of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants) and common shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect shares represented by the unvested portion of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants and the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares of M&#38;T common stock at the average market price during the period, as required by the &#8220;treasury stock method&#8221; of accounting.

GAAP requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) shall be considered participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company has issued stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units that contain such rights and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s earnings per common share are calculated using the two-class method.

&#160;

Treasury stock

Repurchases of shares of M&#38;T common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction of shareholders&#8217; equity. Reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.

&#160;

2. Investment securities

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted amended guidance requiring equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income. This amended guidance excludes equity method investments, investments in consolidated subsidiaries, exchange membership ownership interests, and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Federal Reserve Bank of New York capital stock. Upon adoption the Company reclassified $ 17 million, after-tax effect, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings, representing the difference between fair value and the cost basis of equity investments with readily determinable fair values at January 1, 2018. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities were as follows:

One-to-four family residential mortgage loans held for sale were $ 414 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 205 million at December 31, 2018. Commercial real estate loans held for sale were $ 28 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 347 million at December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately $ 3.9 billion of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s participation in the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (&#8220;DUS&#8221;) program. At December 31, 2019, the Company estimated that the recourse obligations described above were not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those credit recourse arrangements.

In addition to recourse obligations, as described in note 21, the Company is contractually obligated to repurchase previously sold residential real estate loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria related to underwriting procedures or loan documentation. When required to do so, the Company may reimburse loan purchasers for losses incurred or may repurchase certain loans. Charges incurred for such obligation were no t material in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

During the normal course of business, the Company modifies loans to maximize recovery efforts. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and a concession is granted, the Company considers such modifications as troubled debt restructurings and classifies those loans as either nonaccrual loans or renegotiated loans. The types of concessions that the Company grants typically include principal deferrals and interest rate concessions, but may also include other types of concessions.

&#160;

The tables that follow summarize the Company&#8217;s loan modification activities that were considered troubled debt restructurings for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

Financial effects impacting the recorded investment included principal payments or advances, charge-offs and capitalized escrow arrearages. The present value of interest rate concessions, discounted at the effective rate of the original loan, was not material.

##TABLE_END

Troubled debt restructurings are considered to be impaired loans and for purposes of establishing the allowance for credit losses are evaluated for impairment giving consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the present value of the loan&#8217;s expected cash flows. Impairment of troubled debt restructurings that have subsequently defaulted may also be measured based on the loan&#8217;s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. Charge-offs may also be recognized on troubled debt restructurings that have subsequently defaulted. Loans that were modified as troubled debt restructurings during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and for which there was a subsequent payment default during the respective year were not material.

Borrowings by directors and certain officers of M&#38;T and its banking subsidiaries, and by associates of such persons, exclusive of loans aggregating less than $60,000 , amounted to $ 28 million and $ 77 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2019, new borrowings by such persons amounted to $ 1 million (including any borrowings of new directors or officers that were outstanding at the time of their election) and repayments and other reductions (including reductions resulting from individuals ceasing to be directors or officers) were $ 50 million.

At December 31, 2019, approximately $ 11.9 billion of commercial loans and leases, $ 13.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, $ 11.5 billion of one-to-four family residential real estate loans, $ 2.3 billion of home equity loans and lines of credit and $ 7.5 billion of other consumer loans were pledged to secure outstanding borrowings from the FHLB of New York and available lines of credit as described in note 8.

The Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio includes commercial lease financing receivables consisting of direct financing and leveraged leases for machinery and equipment, railroad equipment, commercial trucks and trailers, and aircraft. Certain leases contain payment schedules that are tied to variable interest rate indices. In general, early termination options are provided if the lessee is not in default, returns the leased equipment and pays an early termination fee. Additionally, options to purchase the underlying asset by the lessee are generally at the fair market value of the equipment. 

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance related to lease accounting published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;). Under the new guidance, the accounting applied by lessors is largely unchanged from previous GAAP, however, the guidance eliminates the accounting model for leveraged leases that commence after the effective date of the guidance. A summary of lease financing receivables follows:

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Despite the allocations in the preceding tables, the allowance for credit losses is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease type.

In establishing the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases on a collective basis. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amounts of loss components in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios are determined through a loan-by-loan analysis of larger balance commercial loans and commercial real estate loans that are in nonaccrual status and by applying loss factors to groups of loan balances based on loan type and management&#8217;s classification of such loans under the Company&#8217;s loan grading system. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company utilizes a loan grading system that is applied to commercial and commercial real estate credits on an individual loan basis. Loan grades are assigned loss factors that reflect the Company&#8217;s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss factors include borrower-specific information 

&#160;

related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral values, geographic location, financial condition and performance, payment status, and other information&#59; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries&#59; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans&#59; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios&#59; trends in volume and terms of loans&#59; effects of changes in credit concentrations&#59; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. 

The following tables provide information with respect to loans and leases that were considered impaired as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

##TABLE_END

Commercial loans and commercial real estate loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible &#8220;pass&#8221; loan grades and are generally ascribed lower loss factors when determining the allowance for credit losses. Loans with an elevated level of credit risk are classified as &#8220;criticized&#8221; and are ascribed a higher loss factor when determining the allowance for credit losses. Criticized loans may be classified as &#8220;nonaccrual&#8221; if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Furthermore, criticized nonaccrual commercial loans and commercial real estate loans are considered impaired and, as a result, specific loss allowances on such loans are established within the allowance for credit losses to the extent appropriate in each individual instance.

&#160;

The following table summarizes the loan grades applied to the various classes of the Company&#8217;s commercial loans and commercial real estate loans.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

In determining the allowance for credit losses, residential real estate loans and consumer loans are generally evaluated collectively after considering such factors as payment performance and recent loss experience and trends, which are mainly driven by current collateral values in the market place as well as the amount of loan defaults. Loss rates on such loans are determined by reference to recent charge-off history and are evaluated (and adjusted if deemed appropriate) through consideration of other factors including near-term forecasted loss estimates developed by the Company&#8217;s credit department. In arriving at such forecasts, the Company considers the current estimated fair value of its collateral based on geographical adjustments for home price depreciation/appreciation and overall borrower repayment performance. With regard to collateral values, the realizability of such values by the Company contemplates repayment of any first lien position prior to recovering amounts on a second lien position. However, residential real estate loans and outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit that are more than 150 days past due are generally evaluated for collectibility on a loan-by-loan basis by giving consideration to estimated collateral values. The carrying value of residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit for which a partial charge-off has been recognized totaled $ 25 million and $ 19 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and $ 29 million and $ 23 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit that were more than 150 days past due but did not require a partial charge-off because the net realizable value of the collateral exceeded the outstanding customer balance were $ 18 million and $ 29 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and $ 21 million and $ 31 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.

The Company also measures additional losses for purchased impaired loans when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition. The determination of the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses is very subjective. Given that inherent subjectivity and potential imprecision involved in determining the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses, the Company also provides an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to recognize probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable and includes management&#8217;s subjective determination of amounts necessary to provide for the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Therefore, the level of the unallocated portion of the allowance is primarily reflective of the inherent 

&#160;

imprecision in the various calculations used in determining the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. Other factors that could also lead to changes in the unallocated portion include the effects of expansion into new markets for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions, the introduction of new loan and lease product types, and other risks associated with the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio that may not be specifically identifiable. 

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses summarized on the basis of the Company&#8217;s impairment methodology was as follows:

The January 1, 2019 adoption of new lease accounting guidance from the FASB resulted in the Company recording right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for all operating leases with a term greater than twelve months. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedients that (1) reassessment is not needed for whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) reassessment of the classification of existing operating and finance leases is not required, and (3) a lease that has a term of twelve months or less is not required to apply the asset and liability recognition requirements. 

The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease based on whether a contract, or a part of a contract, conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If it is determined that a contract contains a lease, the consideration in the contract is separated between lease and nonlease components (for example, taxes or common area maintenance). In calculating the present value of the lease payments, the Company has utilized its incremental secured borrowing rate based on the lease term.

The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relate to banking offices and other space occupied by the Company and use of certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements, which prior to the adoption of the guidance were not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. 

As of December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $ 488 million of operating lease liabilities as a component of &#8220;accrued interest and other liabilities&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company&#8217;s noncancelable operating lease agreements expire at various dates over the next 22 years. Real estate leases generally consist of fixed monthly rental payments with certain leases containing escalation clauses. Any variable lease payments or payments for nonlease components are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of &#8220;equipment and net occupancy&#8221; expense based on actual costs incurred. Some leases contain lessee options to extend the term. Those options are included in the lease term when it is determined that it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. 

The Company has noncancelable operating lease agreements for certain equipment related to ATMs, servers, printers and mail machines that are used in the normal course of operations. The ATM leases are either based on the rights to a specific square footage or a license agreement whereby the Company has the right to operate an ATM in a landlord's location. The lease terms 

&#160;

generally contain both fixed payments and variable payments that are transaction-based. Given the transaction-based nature of the variable payments, such payments are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability and are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of &#8220;equipment and net occupancy&#8221; expense when incurred. 

The following table presents information about the Company&#8217;s lease costs for operating leases recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, cash paid toward lease liabilities, and the weighted-average remaining term and discount rates of the operating leases.

Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were $ 32.3 billion at December 31, 2019, $ 22.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and $ 22.6 billion at December 31, 2017. Excluded from residential mortgage loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $ 62.8 billion, $ 56.8 billion and $ 56.6 billion at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. On January 31, 2019, the Company purchased servicing rights for residential real estate loans that had outstanding principal balances at that date of approximately $ 13.3 billion. The purchase price of such servicing rights was approximately $ 144 million. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for others were $ 17.6 billion at December 31, 2019, $ 15.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and $ 13.6 billion at December 31, 2017. Excluded from commercial mortgage loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $ 3.4 billion at December 31, 2019, $ 2.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and $ 2.6 billion at December 31, 2017.

The estimated fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately $ 297 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 240 million at December 31, 2018. The fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was estimated using weighted-average discount rates of 10.6 % and 11.4 % at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the discount rate represented a weighted-average option-adjusted spread (&#8220;OAS&#8221;) of 928 basis points (hundredths of one percent) and 963 basis points, respectively, over market implied forward London Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). The estimated fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment speeds. The estimated fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately $ 153 million and $ 135 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. An 18 % discount rate was used to estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing rights at December 31, 2019 and 2018 with no prepayment assumptions because, in general, the servicing agreements allow the Company to share in customer loan prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights associated with such loan. The Company&#8217;s ability to realize the carrying value of capitalized commercial mortgage servicing rights is more dependent on the borrowers&#8217; abilities to repay the underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in interest rates.

The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of significant portfolios of capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2019 and the sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are summarized in the table that follows. Those calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. In 

&#160;

reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.

The Company does not amortize goodwill, however, core deposit and other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated life of each respective asset. At December 31, 2019 the Company reduced by $ 933 million the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization associated with intangible assets that had been fully amortized and, therefore, had no remaining net carrying amount. Total amortizing intangible assets were comprised of the following:

The Company completed annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . For purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations, which has historically been the Company&#8217;s core relationship business reporting units. Goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair value of the acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the time of each respective acquisition. The implied fair value of the goodwill was determined as the difference between the estimated incremental overall fair value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective acquisition date. To test for goodwill impairment at each evaluation date, the Company compared the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair values of reporting units as of the acquisition dates and as of the evaluation dates were similar. For the Company&#8217;s core customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows of the reporting unit. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment tests, the Company concluded that the amount of recorded goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing dates. 

A summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 for purposes of testing for impairment is as follows:

&#160;

The variable rate senior notes of M&#38;T Bank pay interest quarterly at rates that are indexed to the three-month LIBOR. The contractual interest rates for those notes ranged from 2.21 % to 2.54 % at December 31, 2019 and 2.76 % to 3.25 % at December 31, 2018. The weighted-average contractual interest rate was &#160; 2.34 % at December 31, 2019 and 2.96 % at December 31, 2018. 

Long-term fixed rate advances from the FHLB had weighted-average contractual interest rates of 5.82 % at December 31, 2019 and 2.06 % at December 31, 2018. Advances from the FHLB outstanding at December 31, 2019 mature in 2029 and 2035 and are secured by residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and investment securities.

The remaining long-term agreement to repurchase securities at December 31, 2019 had a contractual interest rate of 4.29 %. Agreements to repurchase securities outstanding at December 31, 2018 had contractual interest rates that ranged from 4.09 % to 4.58 %. The outstanding agreement at December 31, 2019 has a repurchase date in 2020 , however, the contractual maturities of the underlying investment securities extend beyond such repurchase date. The agreement is subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, however, the Company has not offset any amounts related to the agreement in its consolidated financial statements. The Company posted collateral consisting primarily of government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities of $ 108 million and $ 428 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The notes that mature in 2020 pay interest monthly at a rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR. The contractual interest rate was 3.02 % and 3.72 % at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The notes that mature in 2021 pay interest quarterly at a rate that is indexed to the three-month LIBOR. The contractual interest rate was 2.55 % at December 31, 2019 and 3.38 % at December 31, 2018.

The fixed and variable rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of M&#38;T (&#8220;Junior Subordinated Debentures&#8221;) are held by various trusts and were issued in connection with the issuance by those trusts of preferred capital securities (&#8220;Capital Securities&#8221;) and common securities (&#8220;Common Securities&#8221;). The proceeds from the issuances of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities were used by the trusts to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Common Securities of each of those trusts are wholly owned by M&#38;T and are the only class of each trust&#8217;s securities possessing general voting powers. The Capital Securities represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the corresponding trust. Under the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s risk-based capital guidelines, the Capital Securities qualify for inclusion in Tier 2 regulatory capital. The variable rate Junior Subordinated Debentures pay interest quarterly at rates that are indexed to the three-month LIBOR. Those rates ranged from 2.76 % to 5.34 % at December 31, 2019 and from 3.39 % to 5.69 % at December 31, 2018. The weighted-average variable rates payable on those Junior Subordinated Debentures were 3.37 % at December 31, 2019 and 3.94 % at December 31, 2018.

Holders of the Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash distributions unless M&#38;T exercises its right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures as allowed by the terms of each such debenture, in which case payment of distributions on the respective Capital Securities will be deferred for comparable periods. During an extended interest period, M&#38;T may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of its capital stock. In general, the agreements governing the Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&#38;T of the payment of distributions on, the redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Capital Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and the Capital Securities are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of M&#38;T.

The Capital Securities will remain outstanding until the Junior Subordinated Debentures are repaid at maturity, are redeemed prior to maturity or are distributed in liquidation to the trusts. The Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole, but not in part, upon repayment at the stated 

&#160;

maturity dates (ranging from 2027 to 2033 ) of the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole upon the occurrence of one or more events set forth in the indentures relating to the Capital Securities, and in whole or in part at any time after an optional redemption prior to contractual maturity contemporaneously with the optional redemption of the related Junior Subordinated Debentures in whole or in part, subject to possible regulatory approval.

10. Revenue from contracts with customers

Effective January 1, 2018 the Company adopted amended accounting and disclosure guidance for revenue from contracts with customers under the modified retrospective approach. A significant amount of the Company&#8217;s revenues are derived from net interest income on financial assets and liabilities, mortgage banking revenues, trading account and foreign exchange gains, investment securities gains, loan and letter of credit fees, income from bank-owned life insurance, and certain other revenues that are generally excluded from the scope of the amended guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. As a result of the adoption, the Company began reporting credit card interchange revenue net of $ 25 million and $ 14 million of rewards in other revenues from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Credit card rewards expense of $ 13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was included in other costs of operations. The adjustment to beginning retained earnings as well as the impact of any changes in timing of revenue recognition of noninterest income items within the scope of the guidance was not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position at December 31, 2017 or its consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

For noninterest income revenue streams, the Company recognizes the expected amount of consideration as revenue when the performance obligations related to the services under the terms of a contract are satisfied. The Company&#8217;s contracts generally do not contain terms that necessitate significant judgment to determine the amount of revenue to recognize.

The Company generally charges customer accounts or otherwise bills customers upon completion of its services. Typically the Company&#8217;s contracts with customers have a duration of one year or less and payment for services is received at least annually, but oftentimes more frequently as services are provided. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $ 62 million and $ 56 million, respectively, of uncollected amounts receivable related to recognized revenue from the sources in the accompanying tables. Such amounts are classified in accrued interest and other assets in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. In certain situations the Company is paid in advance of providing services and defers the recognition of revenue until its service obligation is satisfied. At each of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had deferred revenue of $ 43 million related to the sources in the accompanying tables and recorded such amounts in accrued interest and other liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. The following tables summarize sources of the Company&#8217;s noninterest income during 2019 and 2018 that are subject to the amended guidance.

Service charges on deposit accounts include fees deducted directly from customer account balances, such as account maintenance, insufficient funds and other transactional service charges, and also include debit card interchange revenue resulting from customer initiated transactions. Account maintenance charges are generally recognized as revenue on a monthly basis, whereas other fees are recognized after the respective service is provided. 

Trust income includes fees related to the Institutional Client Services (&#8220;ICS&#8221;) business and the Wealth Advisory Services (&#8220;WAS&#8221;) business. Revenues from the ICS business are largely derived from a variety of trustee, agency, investment, cash management and administrative services, whereas revenues from the WAS business are mainly derived from asset management, fiduciary services, and family office services. Trust fees may be billed in arrears or in advance and are recognized as revenues as the Company&#8217;s performance obligations are satisfied. Certain fees are based on a percentage of assets invested or under management and are recognized as the service is performed and constraints regarding the uncertainty of the amount of fees are resolved. 

&#160;

Brokerage services income includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees. Such revenues are generally recognized at the time of transaction execution. Mutual fund and other distribution fees are recognized upon initial placement of customer funds as well as in future periods as such customers continue to hold amounts in those mutual funds. 

&#160;

Other revenues from operations include merchant discount and credit card fees such as interchange fees and merchant discount fees that are generally recognized when the cardholder&#8217;s transaction is approved and settled.

&#160;

time the insurance policy is executed with the customer. Insurance renewal commissions are recognized upon subsequent renewal of the policy.

The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during those periods was $ 3 million, $ 16 million and $ 31 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was not material. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was not material. Upon the exercise of stock options, the Company may issue shares from treasury stock to the extent available or issue new shares.

Stock purchase plan

M&#38;T received cash for shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan of $ 11 million in 2019 and $ 10 million in each of 2018 and 2017. Compensation expense recognized for the stock purchase plan was not significant in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Deferred bonus plan

The Company provided a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which eligible employees could elect to defer all or a portion of their annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such awards to several investment options, including M&#38;T common stock. Participants could elect the timing of distributions from the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception of balances allocated to M&#38;T common stock which are distributable in the form of M&#38;T common stock. Shares of M&#38;T common stock distributable pursuant to the terms of the deferred bonus plan were 16,491 and 18,292 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is included in &#8220;common stock issuable&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet.

Directors&#8217; stock plan

The Company maintains a compensation plan for non-employee members of the Company&#8217;s boards of directors and directors advisory councils that allows such members to receive all or a portion of their compensation in shares of M&#38;T common stock. Through December 31, 2019, 282,532 shares had been issued in connection with the directors&#8217; stock plan.

The Company has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for certain key executives and others. The projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data related to such plan were $ 154 million as of December 31, 2019 and $ 143 million as of December 31, 2018.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $ 2.2 billion and $ 1.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

&#160;

GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation&#59; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit expense, are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit expense if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. As indicated in the preceding table, as of December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a minimum liability adjustment of $ 465 million ($ 509 million related to pension plans and $( 44 ) million related to other postretirement benefits) with a corresponding reduction of shareholders&#8217; equity, net of applicable deferred taxes, of $ 342 million. In aggregate, the benefit plans realized a net loss during 2019 that resulted in an increase to the minimum liability adjustment from that which was recorded at December 31, 2018 of $ 110 million. The net loss in 2019 was mainly the result of lowering the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation of all plans to 3.25 % at December 31, 2019 from 4.25 % used at the prior year-end, offset, in part, by the amortization of actuarial losses and a return on plan assets that exceeded the assumed expected return. &#160; The table below reflects the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income related to the Company&#8217;s postretirement benefit plans.

The Company also provides a qualified defined contribution pension plan to eligible employees who were not participants in the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2005 and to other employees who have elected to participate in the defined contribution plan. The Company makes contributions to the defined contribution plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual participant&#8217;s total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. Pension expense recorded in 2019, 2018 and 2017 associated with the defined contribution pension plan was approximately $ 32 million, $ 29 million and $ 30 million, respectively.

Assumptions

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Company&#8217;s future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Company&#8217;s benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general as of the year-end.

The expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each measurement date was developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds&#8217; past experience, and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected rate of return assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the plan assets, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in these assumptions, with all other assumptions held constant, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of approximately $ 5 million&#59; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of approximately $ 8 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. Additionally, an increase of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have decreased the benefit obligation by

$ 75 million and a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased the benefit obligation by $ 79 million at December 31, 2019. 

For measurement of other postretirement benefits, a 6.25 % annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2020. The rate was assumed to decrease to 5.00 % over nine years . A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects:

Plan assets

The Company&#8217;s policy is to invest the pension plan assets in a prudent manner for the purpose of providing benefit payments to participants and mitigating reasonable expenses of administration. The Company&#8217;s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long-term, places an emphasis on the preservation of capital. The strategy attempts to maximize investment returns on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Company while complying with applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset diversification as a principal determinant for establishing an appropriate risk profile while emphasizing total return realized from capital appreciation, dividends and interest income. The target allocations for plan assets are generally 25 to 60 percent equity securities, 10 to 65 percent debt securities, and 5 to 60 percent money-market investments/cash equivalents and other investments, although holdings could be more or less than these general guidelines based on market conditions at the time and actions taken or recommended by the investment managers providing advice to the Company. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. Equity securities may include investments in domestic and international equities, through individual securities, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Debt securities may include investments in corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government agencies and U.S. Treasury securities, through individual securities and mutual funds. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s defined benefit pension plan held $ 439 million ( 22 % of total assets) of real estate funds, private investments, hedge funds and other investments at December 31, 2019. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. Furthermore, management regularly reviews the investment policy and may, if deemed appropriate, make changes to the target allocations noted above.

&#160;

The fair values of the Company&#8217;s pension plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, were as follows:

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as required by government regulation or as deemed appropriate by management after considering factors such as the fair value of plan assets, expected returns on such assets, and the present value of benefit obligations of the plan. The Company made voluntary contributions of $ 200 million to the qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017. &#160; The Company did no t make any contributions to the plan in 2019 or 2018. The Company is not required to make contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan in 2020, however, subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances that may occur in 2020, the Company may make contributions, but the amount of any such contributions has not been determined. The Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations for the supplemental defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets for investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental pension benefits were $ 10 million and $ 15 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Payments made by the Company for postretirement benefits were $ 6 million and $ 7 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Payments for supplemental pension and other postretirement benefits for 2020 are not expected to differ from those made in 2019 by an amount that will be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position.

Estimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related to the Company&#8217;s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans are as follows:

&#160;

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return reflecting taxable income earned by all domestic subsidiaries. In prior years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial institutions the option of deducting as bad debt expense for tax purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with GAAP, such financial institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve established under the previously allowed method will result in taxable income if M&#38;T Bank fails to maintain bank status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31, 2019, M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s tax bad debt reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was $ 137 million. No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become wholly or partially taxable.

Income taxes attributable to gains or losses on bank investment securities were an expense of $ 5 million in 2019 and $ 7 million in 2017, and a benefit of $ 2 million in 2018. No alternative minimum tax expense was recognized in 2017. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;Tax Act&#8221;) was signed into law on December 22, 2017, reducing the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018 and making other changes to U.S. corporate income tax laws, including eliminating the alternative minimum tax as of January 1, 2018. GAAP requires that the impact of the provisions of the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the incremental income tax expense recorded by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Tax Act was $ 85 million. That additional expense was largely attributable to the reduction in carrying value of net deferred tax assets reflecting lower future tax benefits resulting from the lower corporate income tax rate. During 2018 the Company received approval from the Internal Revenue Service to change the timing of recognition of certain loan fees 

&#160;

retroactive to 2017. Given the reduction of the federal income tax rate, the change resulted in a $ 15 million reduction of income tax expense in 2018. 

Total income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as follows:

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies.

The income tax credits shown in the statement of income of M&#38;T in note 25 arise principally from operating losses before dividends from subsidiaries.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:

The Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The balance of accrued interest at December 31, 2019 is included in the table above. The Company&#8217;s federal, state and local income tax returns are routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should determinations rendered by tax authorities ultimately indicate that management&#8217;s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. Examinations by the Internal Revenue Service of the Company&#8217;s federal income tax returns have been largely concluded through 2018, although under statute the income tax returns from 2016 through 2018 could be adjusted. The Company also files income tax returns in over forty states and numerous local jurisdictions. Substantially all material state and local matters have been concluded for years through 2013. It is not reasonably possible to estimate when examinations for any subsequent years will be completed.

GAAP defines unvested share-based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities that shall be included in the computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company has issued stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units, which, in accordance with GAAP, are considered participating securities.

Stock-based compensation awards and warrants to purchase common stock of M&#38;T representing common shares of 238,000 in 2019, 194,000 in 2018 and 401,000 in 2017 were not included in the computations of diluted earnings per common share because the effect on those years would have been antidilutive.

15. Comprehensive income

In February 2018, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI so that following enactment of the Tax Act the tax effects of items within AOCI reflect the appropriate tax. The guidance provided for a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities related to items within AOCI at the 21 percent corporate tax rate established by the Tax Act. The impact of that reclassification was an increase in retained earnings as of December 31, 2017 resulting from items remaining in AOCI as of that date as follows:

17. International activities

The Company engages in limited international activities including certain trust-related services in Europe, collecting Eurodollar deposits, engaging in foreign currency transactions associated with customer activity, providing credit to support the international activities of domestic companies and holding certain loans to foreign borrowers. Assets and revenues associated with international activities represent less than 1 % of the Company&#8217;s consolidated assets and revenues. International assets included $ 186 million and $ 172 million of loans to foreign borrowers at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Deposits at M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s Cayman Islands office were $ 1.68 billion and $ 812 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. Deposits at M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s office in Ontario, Canada were $ 23 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 22 million at December 31, 2018. Revenues from providing international trust-related services were approximately $ 32 million in 2019, $ 29 million in 2018 and $ 24 million in 2017.

&#160;

18. Derivative financial instruments

As part of managing interest rate risk, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the Company&#8217;s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Interest rate swap agreements are generally entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and most contain master netting, collateral and/or settlement provisions protecting the at-risk party. Based on adherence to the Company&#8217;s credit standards and the presence of the netting, collateral or settlement provisions, the Company believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts was not material as of December 31, 2019.

The net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to decrease net interest income by $ 2 million in 2019 and $ 25 million in 2018, and to increase net interest income by $ 25 million in 2017. 

&#160;

Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes summarized by type of financial instrument the swap agreements were intended to hedge follows:

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The amount of gain (loss) recognized in the consolidated statement of income associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was not material.

The Company also has commitments to sell and commitments to originate residential and commercial real estate loans that are considered derivatives. The Company designates certain of the commitments to sell real estate loans as fair value hedges of real estate loans held for sale. The Company also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. As a result of these activities, net unrealized pre-tax gains related to hedged loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans were approximately $ 18 million at each of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in mortgage banking revenues and, in general, are realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and commitments satisfied.

The Company does not offset derivative asset and liability positions in its consolidated financial statements. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit risk by entering into derivative contracts is mitigated through master netting agreements and collateral posting or settlement requirements. Master netting agreements covering interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with the same party include a right 

&#160;

to set-off that becomes enforceable in the event of default, early termination or under other specific conditions. 

The aggregate fair value of derivative financial instruments in a liability position, which are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, was $ 51 million and $ 21 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which the Company was required to post collateral relating to those positions of $ 50 million and $ 18 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Certain of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments contain provisions that require the Company to maintain specific credit ratings from credit rating agencies to avoid higher collateral posting requirements. If the Company&#8217;s debt ratings were to fall below specified ratings, the counterparties of the derivative financial instruments could demand immediate incremental collateralization on those instruments in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of all derivative financial instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position on December 31, 2019 was not significant. If the credit risk-related contingent features had been triggered on December 31, 2019, the Company would no t have been required to post any additional collateral with counterparties.

The aggregate fair value of derivative financial instruments in an asset position, which are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, was $ 6 million and $ 18 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Counterparties posted collateral relating to those positions of $ 5 million and $ 16 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Trading account interest rate swap agreements entered into with customers are subject to the Company&#8217;s credit risk standards and often contain collateral provisions.

In addition to the derivative contracts noted above, the Company clears certain derivative transactions through a clearinghouse, rather than directly with counterparties. Those transactions cleared through a clearinghouse require initial margin collateral and variation margin payments depending on the contracts being in a net asset or liability position. The amount of initial margin collateral posted by the Company was $ 84 million and $ 65 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value asset and liability amounts of derivative contracts have been reduced by variation margin payments treated as settlements as described herein. Variation margin on derivative contracts not treated as settlements continues to represent collateral posted or received by the Company. 

&#160;

&#160;

19. Variable interest entities

The Company&#8217;s securitization activity has consisted of securitizing loans originated for sale into government issued or guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The amounts of those securitizations in 2019, 2018 and 2017 are presented in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company has no t recognized any losses as a result of having securitized assets.

As described in note 8, M&#38;T has issued junior subordinated debentures payable to various trusts that have issued Capital Securities. M&#38;T owns the common securities of those trust entities. The Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of those entities and, accordingly, the trusts are not included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. At each of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company included the junior subordinated debentures as &#8220;long-term borrowings&#8221; in its consolidated balance sheet and recognized $ 23 million in other assets for its &#8220;investment&#8221; in the common securities of the trusts that will be concomitantly repaid to M&#38;T by the respective trust from the proceeds of M&#38;T&#8217;s repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities described in note 8.

The Company has invested as a limited partner in various partnerships that collectively had total assets of approximately $ 1.5 billion at of December 31, 2019 and $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Those partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which the investing partners are 

&#160;

eligible to receive certain federal income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines. Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the Company&#8217;s investments in such partnerships are generally subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with the respective government regulations. The Company&#8217;s carrying amount of its investments in such partnerships was $ 748 million, including $ 414 million of unfunded commitments, at December 31, 2019 and $ 523 million, including $ 280 million of unfunded commitments, at December 31, 2018 . Contingent commitments to provide additional capital contributions to these partnerships were not material at December 31, 2019 . The Company has not provided financial or other support to the partnerships that was not contractually required. The Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss from its investments in such partnerships as of December 31, 2019 was $ 984 million, including possible recapture of certain tax credits. Management currently estimates that no material losses are probable as a result of the Company&#8217;s involvement with such entities. The Company, in its position as limited partner, does not direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the partnerships and, therefore, in accordance with the accounting provisions for variable interest entities, the partnership entities are not included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The Company&#8217;s investment in qualified affordable housing projects is amortized to income taxes in the consolidated statement of income as tax credits and other tax benefits resulting from deductible losses associated with the projects are received. 

The Company serves as investment advisor for certain registered money-market funds. The Company has no explicit arrangement to provide support to those funds, but may waive portions of its allowable management fees as a result of market conditions.

&#160;

&#160;

20. Fair value measurements

GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and other items at fair value. The Company has not made any fair value elections at December 31, 2019.

Pursuant to GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy exists in GAAP for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability.

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Level 1 &#8212; Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Level 2 &#8212; Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Level 3 &#8212; Valuation is derived from model-based and other techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and which may be based on the Company&#8217;s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability. 

##TABLE_END

When available, the Company attempts to use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1 or Level 2. If quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair value is often determined using model-based techniques incorporating various assumptions including interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses. Assets and liabilities valued using model-based techniques are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, depending on the lowest level classification of an input that is considered significant to the overall valuation. 

&#160;

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis at estimated fair value. 

Trading account assets and liabilities

Trading account assets and liabilities include interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts with customers who require such services with offsetting positions with third parties to minimize the Company&#8217;s risk with respect to such transactions. The Company generally determines the fair value of its derivative trading account assets and liabilities using externally developed pricing models based on market observable inputs and, therefore, classifies such valuations as Level 2. Mutual funds held in connection with deferred compensation and other arrangements have been classified as Level 1 valuations. Valuations of investments in municipal and other bonds can generally be obtained through reference to quoted prices in less active markets for the same or similar securities or through model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 2.

Investment securities available for sale and equity securities

The majority of the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale investment securities have been valued by reference to prices for similar securities or through model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 2. Certain investments in mutual funds and equity securities are actively traded and, therefore, have been classified as Level 1 valuations.

Real estate loans held for sale

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale includes changes in estimated fair value during the hedge period. Typically, the Company attempts to hedge real estate loans held for sale from the date of close through the sale date. The fair value of hedged real estate loans held for sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real estate loans with similar characteristics and, accordingly, such loans have been classified as a Level 2 valuation.

Commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans

The Company enters into various commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans. Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values of such commitments were generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real estate loans to certain government-sponsored entities and other parties. The fair valuations of commitments to sell real estate loans generally result in a Level 2 classification. The estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale is adjusted to reflect the Company&#8217;s anticipated commitment expirations. The estimated commitment expirations are considered significant unobservable inputs contributing to the Level 3 classification of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. Significant unobservable inputs used in the determination of estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale are included in the accompanying table of significant unobservable inputs to Level 3 measurements.

Interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company generally determines the fair value of its interest rate swap 

&#160;

agreements using externally developed pricing models based on market observable inputs and, therefore, classifies such valuations as Level 2. The Company has considered counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap agreement assets and has considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap agreement liabilities . 

The following tables present assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis:

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START (a) 

The Company&#8217;s policy for transfers between fair value levels is to recognize the transfer as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (b) 

Reported as mortgage banking revenues in the consolidated statement of income and includes the fair value of commitment issuances and expirations.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (c) 

Transfers out of Level 3 consist of interest rate locks transferred to closed loans.

##TABLE_END

The Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the carrying value of certain assets or provide valuation allowances related to certain assets using fair value measurements. The more significant of those assets follow.

Loans

Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include 

&#160;

certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans when establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated valuation amount does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is typically valued using appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally been classified as Level 2, unless significant adjustments have been made to the valuation that are not readily observable by market participants. Non-real estate collateral supporting commercial loans generally consists of business assets such as receivables, inventory and equipment. Fair value estimations are typically determined by discounting recorded values of those assets to reflect estimated net realizable value considering specific borrower facts and circumstances and the experience of credit personnel in their dealings with similar borrower collateral liquidations. Such discounts were generally in the range of 10 % to 85 % at December 31, 2019 . As these discounts are not readily observable and are considered significant, the valuations have been classified as Level 3. Automobile collateral is typically valued by reference to independent pricing sources based on recent sales transactions of similar vehicles, and the related non-recurring fair value measurement adjustments have been classified as Level 2. Collateral values for other consumer installment loans are generally estimated based on historical recovery rates for similar types of loans. As these recovery rates are not readily observable by market participants, such valuation adjustments have been classified as Level 3. Loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement were $ 305 &#160; &#160; million at December 31, 2019 , ( $ 115 million and $ 190 million of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively), $ 268 million at December 31, 2018 ($ 120 million and $ 148 million of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively), and $ 210 million at December 31, 2017 ($ 145 million and $ 65 million of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively). Changes in fair value recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 for partial charge-offs of loans and loan impairment reserves on loans held by the Company at the end of each of those years were decreases of $ 110 million, $ 83 million and $ 56 million, respectively. 

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans

Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily comprised of commercial and residential real property and are generally measured at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of the real property is generally determined using appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace, and the related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally been classified as Level 2. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement were $ 21 million and $ 28 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Changes in fair value recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for foreclosed assets held by the Company at the end of each of those years were not material.

&#160;

Significant unobservable inputs to level 3 measurements

Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs

An increase (decrease) in the estimate of expirations for commitments to originate real estate loans would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value measurement. Estimated commitment expirations are derived considering loan type, changes in interest rates and remaining length of time until closing.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

With the exception of marketable securities, certain off-balance sheet financial instruments and mortgage loans originated for sale, the Company&#8217;s financial instruments are not readily marketable and market prices do not exist. The Company, in attempting to comply with the provisions of GAAP that require disclosures of fair value of financial instruments, has not attempted to market its financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of the buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales prices could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can dramatically impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time. 

The Company does not believe that the estimated information presented herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not consider any value associated with existing customer relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating activities. Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly, the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates may not be comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made. Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet 

&#160;

date, the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various financial instruments could be significantly different.

21. Commitments and contingencies

&#160;

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. In addition to the amounts presented in the preceding table, the Company had discretionary funding commitments to commercial customers of $ 9.1 billion and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that the Company had the unconditional right to cancel prior to funding. Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, whereas commercial letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being funded when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and a third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be obtained based on management&#8217;s assessment of the customer&#8217;s creditworthiness.

Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are predominantly comprised of recourse obligations associated with sold loans and other guarantees and commitments. Included in financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s involvement in the Fannie Mae DUS program. The Company&#8217;s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with loans sold under this program totaled approximately $ 3.9 billion and $ 3.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows.

The Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such commitments are considered derivatives and along 

&#160;

with commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value. 

&#160; The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase previously sold residential real estate loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria related to underwriting procedures or loan documentation. When required to do so, the Company may reimburse loan purchasers for losses incurred or may repurchase certain loans. The Company reduces residential mortgage banking revenues by an estimate for losses related to its obligations to loan purchasers. The amount of those charges is based on the volume of loans sold, the level of reimbursement requests received from loan purchasers and estimates of losses that may be associated with previously sold loans. At December 31, 2019, the Company believes that its obligation to loan purchasers was not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position. 

Wilmington Trust, N.A., a wholly owned bank subsidiary of M&#38;T, provides retirement services, including serving in certain trustee roles relating to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (&#8220;ESOPs&#8221;). Beginning in 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) announced that it would increase its focus on ESOP transactions, particularly with regard to valuation issues relating to ESOP transactions. Beginning in late 2013, Wilmington Trust, N.A. began receiving requests for information and subpoenas relating to certain ESOP transactions for which it acted as trustee. In June 2016, Wilmington Trust, N.A. received a DOL subpoena seeking information on its global ESOP trustee business. In addition to these investigations, the DOL has commenced three lawsuits against Wilmington Trust, N.A. relating to its role as trustee of three ESOP transactions. In July 2019, Wilmington Trust, N.A. reached a settlement in principle with the DOL to resolve certain pending DOL ESOP matters. Although a formal settlement agreement has yet to be finalized and executed, the Company does not expect that the agreed-upon settlement will have a material incremental impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. Wilmington Trust, N.A. is also currently a defendant in five pending private party lawsuits relating to its role as trustee for five ESOP transactions. Under applicable transaction documents, Wilmington Trust, N.A. may be entitled to indemnification by the ESOP plan sponsors. These matters could result in damages, settlements, penalties, restitution, reputational damage or additional costs and expenses.

M&#38;T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings and other matters in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. On an on-going basis management, after consultation with legal counsel, assesses the Company&#8217;s liabilities and contingencies in connection with such proceedings. For those matters where it is probable that the Company will incur losses and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements. To the extent the pending or threatened litigation could result in exposure in excess of that liability, the amount of such excess is not currently estimable. Although not considered probable, the range of reasonably possible losses for such matters in the aggregate, beyond the existing recorded liability, was between $ 0 and $ 50 million. Although the Company does not believe that the outcome of pending litigations will be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position, it cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes will be material to the consolidated results of operations for a particular reporting period in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

22. Segment information

Reportable segments have been determined based upon the Company&#8217;s internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The 

&#160;

reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. 

The financial information of the Company&#8217;s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology that charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the maturity, prepayment and/or repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. A provision for credit losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an amount necessary to adjust the segment&#8217;s allowance for credit losses due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is determined using the methodologies described in notes 1 and 4. The net effects of these allocations are recorded in the &#8220;All Other&#8221; category. Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions of financial institutions) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the Company&#8217;s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk).

The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segment results are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. &#160; &#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START (a) 

Net interest income is the difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a funding charge (credit) based on the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Segments are charged a cost to fund any assets (e.g. loans) and are paid a funding credit for any funds provided (e.g. deposits). The taxable-equivalent adjustment aggregated $ 22,863,000 in 2019, $ 21,897,000 in 2018 and $ 34,570,000 in 2017 and is eliminated in &#8220;All Other&#8221; net interest income and income tax expense (benefit).

The Company conducts substantially all of its operations in the United States. There are no transactions with a single customer that in the aggregate result in revenues that exceed ten percent of consolidated total revenues.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

23. Regulatory matters

Payment of dividends by M&#38;T&#8217;s banking subsidiaries is restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&#38;T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at December 31, 2019, approximately $ 605 million was available for payment of dividends to M&#38;T from banking subsidiaries. M&#38;T may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that the Federal Reserve Board has not objected to.

Banking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the subsidiary banks to M&#38;T unless appropriately secured by assets. Securities of affiliates are not eligible as collateral for this purpose.

The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves against certain deposit liabilities. During the maintenance periods that included December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits at banks included a daily average of $ 666 million and $ 684 million, respectively, for such purpose.

M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy regulations established by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Pursuant to the rules in effect as of December 31, 2019, the required minimum and well capitalized capital ratios are as follows:

Standards Adopted in 2019

&#160;

&#160;

Leases

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The new guidance requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. While the guidance requires all leases to be recognized in the balance sheet, there continues to be a differentiation between finance leases and operating leases for purposes of income statement recognition and cash flow statement presentation. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized separately in the statement of income. Repayments of principal on those lease liabilities are classified within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability are classified within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases, a single lease cost is recognized in the statement of income and allocated over the lease term, generally on a straight-line basis. All cash payments are presented within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The accounting applied by lessors is largely unchanged, however, the guidance eliminates the accounting model for leveraged leases for leases that commence after the effective date of the guidance.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

January 1, 2019

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019 and applied the guidance retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements which prior to the adoption of the guidance were not reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset of $ 394 million and increased liabilities by $ 399 million as a result of recognizing lease liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of income.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The amended guidance requires the premium on callable debt securities to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount&#59; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

January 1, 2019

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company adopted the amended guidance effective January 1, 2019 and applied the modified retrospective approach for reporting purposes. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position nor on its results of operations.

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The amended guidance replaces the incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The guidance requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses will represent a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. The income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. When determining the allowance, expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial asset(s) (taking into account prepayments) will be estimated considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The amended guidance also requires recording an allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination. The initial allowance for these assets will be added to the purchase price at acquisition rather than being reported as an expense. Subsequent changes in the allowance will be recorded through the income statement as an expense adjustment. In addition, the amended guidance requires credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The calculation of credit losses for available-for-sale securities will be similar to how it is determined under existing guidance.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

January 1, 2020

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company has completed its development, validation, and implementation of models and processes used to estimate current expected credit losses as required by the credit losses guidance. The Company&#8217;s approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans includes utilizing macro-economic assumptions to project losses over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company reverts to longer term historical loss experience to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life.

&#160;

Based on portfolio composition, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions, the Company recognized an increase to the allowance for credit losses of $ 132 million upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020 as compared with the allowance for credit losses recognized on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. 

&#160;

The effect on the allowance for credit losses is primarily attributable to increases in reserves for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, which generally have longer estimated lives as compared with commercial and commercial real estate loans. The adoption did not have a material effect on the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities as most of this portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The amended guidance eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

January 1, 2020

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company adopted the amended guidance effective January 1, 2020 using a prospective transition method and will incorporate the guidance as necessary when circumstances arise for the guidance to be utilized. The Company does not expect the guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, unless at some point in the future one of its reporting units were to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The amended guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The amendments are a result of the disclosure framework project that focuses on improvements to the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements. The amendments remove, modify, and add certain disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements being removed relating to public companies are (1) the amount and reason for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and (3) the valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements. The disclosure requirements being modified relating to public companies are (1) for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investee&#8217;s asset and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to the entity or announced the timing publicly, and (2) the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as a result of the use of unobservable inputs. The disclosure requirements being added relating to public companies are (1) to disclose the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and (2) to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company adopted the amended guidance effective January 1, 2020 using a prospective transition method for the amendments relating to changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty. The 2020 first quarter disclosures will reflect this prospective application. All other amendments will be applied retrospectively. The Company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The amended guidance modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans.

Clarifying the Interactions Between Equity Securities, Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and Derivatives and Hedging

&#160;

&#160;

The amendments clarify the following guidance:

1. That an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in the equity securities investments guidance immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting.

2. For the purpose of applying the derivatives and hedging guidance an entity should not consider whether, upon the settlement of a forward contract or exercise of a purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option in accordance with the financial instruments guidance. An entity also would evaluate the remaining characteristics in the derivatives and hedging guidance to determine the accounting for those forward contracts and purchased options.

Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The amendments remove the following exceptions for accounting for income taxes: 

1. Exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items (for example, discontinued operations or other comprehensive income) 

2. Exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment 

3. Exception to the ability not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary 

4. Exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. 

&#160;

The amendments also simplify the accounting for income taxes by doing the following: 

1. Requiring that an entity recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax. 

2. Requiring that an entity evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which the book goodwill was originally recognized and when it should be considered a separate transaction. 

3. Specifying that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements. However, an entity may elect to do so (on an entity-by-entity basis) for a legal entity that is both not subject to tax and disregarded by the taxing authority. 

4. Requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. 

5. Making minor Codification improvements for income taxes related to employee stock ownership plans and investments in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for using the equity method.

&#160;

&#160;

January 1, 2021

&#160;

Early adoption permitted

&#160;

&#160;

The amendments related to separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax should be applied on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. The amendments related to changes in ownership of foreign equity method investments or foreign subsidiaries should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to franchise taxes that are partially based on income should be applied on either a retrospective basis for all periods presented or a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied on a prospective basis.

Early adoption of the amendments in an interim period would require recognition of any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an early adoption election would require adoption of all the amendments in the same period. The Company is evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
