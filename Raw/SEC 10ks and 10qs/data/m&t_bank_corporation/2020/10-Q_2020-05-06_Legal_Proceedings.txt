 Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings.

&#160;

M&#38;T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings and other matters in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. On an on-going basis management, after consultation with legal counsel, assesses the Company&#8217;s liabilities and contingencies in connection with such proceedings. For those matters where it is probable that the Company will incur losses and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements. To the extent the pending or threatened litigation could result in exposure in excess of that liability, the amount of such excess is not currently estimable. Although not considered probable, the range of reasonably possible losses for such matters in the aggregate, beyond the existing recorded liability, was between $0 and $50 million. Although the Company does not believe that the outcome of pending legal matters will be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position, it cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes will be material to the consolidated results of operations for a particular reporting period in the future.

ESOP Matters : Wilmington Trust, N.A. provides retirement services, including serving in certain trustee roles relating to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (&#8220;ESOPs&#8221;). Beginning in 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) announced that it would increase its focus on ESOP transactions, particularly with regard to valuation issues relating to ESOP transactions. Beginning in late 2013, Wilmington Trust, N.A. began receiving requests for information and subpoenas relating to certain ESOP transactions for which it acted as trustee. In June 2016, Wilmington Trust, N.A. received a DOL subpoena seeking information on its global ESOP trustee business. In addition to these investigations, the DOL has commenced three lawsuits against Wilmington Trust, N.A. relating to its role as trustee of three ESOP transactions. In July 2019, Wilmington Trust, N.A. reached a settlement in principle

with the DOL to resolve certain pending DOL ESOP matters. On April 28, 2020, Wilmington Trust N.A. and the DOL executed a formal settlement agreement. The total amount of the settlemen t was $88 million, which included $80 million in payments to 21 ESOPs. The settlement amount is within the Company&#8217;s reserve for litigation matters as of March 31, 2020. Wilmington Trust, N.A. has also been named as a defendant in five private party laws uits relating to its role as trustee for five ESOP transactions. Two of the five private party lawsuits relating to ESOP transactions have been resolved through settlements, which have been preliminarily approved by Courts, and are in the process of admin istration. Neither of the two settlements is material. Under applicable transaction documents, Wilmington Trust, N.A. may be entitled to indemnification by the ESOP plan sponsors. These matters could result in damages, settlements, penalties, restitution, reputational damage or additional costs and expenses. 

&#160;

Due to their complex nature, it is difficult to estimate when litigation and investigatory matters such as these may be resolved. As set forth in the introductory paragraph to this Item 3 &#8212; Legal Proceedings, losses from current litigation and regulatory matters which the Company is subject to that are not currently considered probable are within a range of reasonably possible losses for such matters in the aggregate, beyond the existing recorded liability, and are included in the range of reasonably possible losses set forth above.
