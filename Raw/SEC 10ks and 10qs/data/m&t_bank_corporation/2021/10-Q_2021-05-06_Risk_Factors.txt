 Item 1A. 

Risk Factors.

In addition to the risk factors disclosed in response to Item 1A to Part I of M&#38;T&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, M&#38;T has identified certain supplemental risk factors relating to M&#38;T&#8217;s acquisition of People&#8217;s United Financial, Inc. (&#8220;People&#8217;s United&#8221;) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated February 21, 2021, by and among M&#38;T, Bridge Merger Corp., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of M&#38;T, and People&#8217;s United (the &#8220;merger agreement&#8221; and, such transaction, the &#8220;merger&#8221;). These risk factors and other risks associated with the merger are more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with the merger that was filed by M&#38;T with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 23, 2021.

Risks Related to the Merger 

M&#38;T is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration.

M&#38;T has incurred and expects to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and closing the merger. In addition, M&#38;T will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as M&#38;T integrates the People&#8217;s United business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. 

There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. M&#38;T may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. M&#38;T will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the merger is completed. 

Combining M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and M&#38;T may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United must integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting revenues and future growth. If M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.

An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of M&#38;T following the completion of the merger, which may adversely affect the value of M&#38;T&#8217;s common stock following the completion of the merger.

M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company&#8217;s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies&#8217; ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on M&#38;T during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger.

M&#38;T may be unable to retain M&#38;T and/or People&#8217;s United personnel successfully after the merger is completed.

The success of the merger will depend in part on M&#38;T&#8217;s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with M&#38;T or People&#8217;s United, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with M&#38;T after the merger is completed. If M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the merger, if key employees terminate their employment, M&#38;T&#8217;s business activities may be adversely affected, and management&#8217;s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause M&#38;T&#8217;s business to suffer. In addition, M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.

The COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger . 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of M&#38;T or People&#8217;s United, or the business operations of M&#38;T or People&#8217;s United are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;), the New York Department of Financial Services (&#8220;NYDFS&#8221;), the Connecticut Department of Banking (&#8220;CTDOB&#8221;) and/or other regulators may impose additional requirements on M&#38;T or People&#8217;s United that must be satisfied prior to completion of the merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on M&#38;T following the merger.

Before the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be completed, various approvals, consents and non-objections must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board, the NYDFS, the CTDOB, and other regulatory authorities. In determining whether to grant these approvals, such regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to: an adverse development in either party&#8217;s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals, including factors not known at the present time and factors that may arise in the future&#59; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition&#59; or changes in legislation or the political environment generally. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity, the Federal Reserve Board will expect the banking organization to resolve all such weaknesses before applying for such expansionary activity. The Federal Reserve Board has also stated that if issues arise during the processing of an application for expansionary activity, it will expect the applicant banking organization to withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns.

The approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of M&#38;T&#8217;s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of M&#38;T following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

In addition, despite the parties&#8217; commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the merger agreement, M&#38;T will not be required, and People&#8217;s United will not be permitted without M&#38;T&#8217;s prior written consent, to take actions or agree to conditions in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on M&#38;T and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger. 

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact M&#38;T.

If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of M&#38;T shareholders failing to approve either the amendment to M&#38;T&#8217;s restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of M&#38;T&#8217;s capital stock and preferred stock or the issuance of shares of M&#38;T common stock to People&#8217;s United

&#160;

stockholders in the merger or People&#8217;s United stockholders failing to approve the merger, there may be various adverse consequences and M&#38;T may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. For example, M&#38;T&#8217;s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of M&#38;T common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price of M&#38;T common stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial to M&#38;T and will be completed. M&#38;T could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against M&#38;T to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, M&#38;T may be required to pay a termination fee of $280 million to People&#8217;s United. 

Additionally, M&#38;T has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, M&#38;T would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. 

M&#38;T will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on M&#38;T. These uncertainties may impair M&#38;T&#8217;s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with M&#38;T to seek to change existing business relationships with M&#38;T. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, M&#38;T has agreed to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the merger on a timely basis without People United&#8217;s consent. These restrictions may prevent M&#38;T from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.

Litigation related to the merger has been filed against People&#8217;s United, the People&#8217;s United board of directors and M&#38;T, and additional litigation may be filed against People&#8217;s United, the People&#8217;s United board of directors, M&#38;T and the M&#38;T board of directors in the future, which could prevent or delay the completion of the merger, result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of M&#38;T.

Litigation related to the merger has been filed against People&#8217;s United, the People&#8217;s United board of directors and M&#38;T, and additional litigation may be filed against People&#8217;s United, the People&#8217;s United board of directors, M&#38;T and the M&#38;T board of directors in the future. Among other remedies, litigation that has been filed seeks, and additional litigation by shareholders of M&#38;T and/or stockholders of People&#8217;s United in the future may seek, damages and/or to enjoin the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting M&#38;T or People&#8217;s United from completing the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to M&#38;T, including costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Further, such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of M&#38;T. 

The COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on M&#38;T&#8217;s business and operations following the completion of the merger is uncertain.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of M&#38;T following the completion of the merger will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on M&#38;T&#8217;s business, and there is no guarantee that efforts by M&#38;T to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective.

&#160;

Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, M&#38;T may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s global economic impact, including reduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any recession or depression that may occur.
