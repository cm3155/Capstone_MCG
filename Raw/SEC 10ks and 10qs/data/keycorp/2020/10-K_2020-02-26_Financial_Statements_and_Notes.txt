Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We are responsible for the preparation, content and integrity of the financial statements and other statistical data and analyses compiled for this annual report. The financial statements and related notes have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts which of necessity are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgments and give due consideration to materiality. We believe the financial statements and notes present fairly our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in all material respects. 

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control that is designed to protect our assets and the integrity of our financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This corporate-wide system of controls includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporation&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. All employees are required to comply with our code of ethics. We conduct an annual certification process to ensure that our employees meet this obligation. Although any system of internal control can be compromised by human error or intentional circumvention of required procedures, we believe our system provides reasonable assurance that financial transactions are recorded and reported properly, providing an adequate basis for reliable financial statements. 

During 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors met regularly with Management, internal audit, and the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &#38; Young LLP, to review the scope of their audits and to discuss the evaluation of internal accounting controls and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to, and meet confidentially with, the audit committee to discuss appropriate matters. Also, the Corporation maintains a Disclosure Review Committee. This committee&#8217;s purpose is to design and maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the financial and operating condition of the Corporation is properly reported to its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Auditor, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in connection with the preparation and filing of periodic reports and the certification of those reports by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 

Management&#8217;s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management assessed, with participation of the Corporation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our internal control and procedures over financial reporting using criteria described in &#8220;Internal Control - Integrated Framework,&#8221; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, we believe we maintained an effective system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . 

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report dated February 26, 2020 .

on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited KeyCorp&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, KeyCorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of KeyCorp as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes of KeyCorp and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

KeyCorp&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on KeyCorp&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to KeyCorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

&#160; 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of KeyCorp 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KeyCorp (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

Description of the matter 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio totaled $94.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and the associated allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) was $900 million. As discussed in Note 1 and 5 of the financial statements, the ALLL represents management&#8217;s estimate of incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management estimates the ALLL by applying expected loss rates derived from a statistical analysis of historical default and loss severity experience to existing loans with similar characteristics. The ALLL also considers adjustments to reflect management&#8217;s assessment of qualitative factors that may not be measured in the statistical analysis of expected losses, including external factors, along with Company and portfolio specific factors. 

Auditing management&#8217;s ALLL is complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity due to the judgment required in evaluating management&#8217;s determination of the qualitative external, Company and portfolio specific factor adjustments to the ALLL described above. 

How we addressed the matter in our audit 

&#160; 

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s ALLL process, including controls over the appropriateness of the ALLL methodology, the reliability and accuracy of data used to support qualitative factor adjustments to the ALLL, and management&#8217;s review and approval process over qualitative factor adjustments to the ALLL. 

To test the qualitative factor adjustments, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing management&#8217;s methodology and considering whether relevant risks were reflected in the modeled provision and whether adjustments to modeled calculations were appropriate. We tested the underlying data used to estimate the qualitative adjustments to determine whether it was accurate, complete and relevant. We evaluated whether qualitative adjustments were reasonable based on changes in the loan portfolio and changes in management&#8217;s policies, procedures and lending personnel. For example, we evaluated concentrations of credit by testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying source data utilized by management and independently comparing concentrations to loan portfolio information. We also assessed whether qualitative adjustments were consistent with publicly available information (e.g. macroeconomic and peer bank data). Further, we performed an independent search for the existence of new or contrary information relating to risks impacting the qualitative factor adjustments to validate that management&#8217;s considerations are appropriate.

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Organization 

We are one of the nation&#8217;s largest bank-based financial services companies, providing deposit, lending, cash management, and investment services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses through our subsidiary, KeyBank. We also provide a broad range of sophisticated corporate and investment banking products, such as merger and acquisition advice, public and private debt and equity, syndications, and derivatives to middle market companies in selected industries throughout the United States through our subsidiary, KBCM. As of December 31, 2019 , KeyBank operated 1,098 full-service retail banking branches and 1,420 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two major business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank, is included in Note 25 (&#8220; Business Segment Reporting &#8221;). 

Use of Estimates 

Our accounting policies conform to GAAP and prevailing practices within the financial services industry. We must make certain estimates and judgments when determining the amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, actual results could differ from those reported. 

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Some previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current reporting practices. 

The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of any voting rights entities in which we have a controlling financial interest and certain VIEs. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 13 (&#8220; Variable Interest Entities &#8221;) for information on our involvement with VIEs. 

We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have significant influence over the entity&#8217;s operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50% , but not controlling). Unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at fair value or a cost measurement alternative. 

We have considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements . 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and due from banks are considered &#8220;cash and cash equivalents&#8221; for financial reporting purposes. We do not consider cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve to be restricted. 

Loans 

Loans held in portfolio, which management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, including net deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premiums and discounts. We defer certain nonrefundable loan origination and commitment fees, and the direct costs of originating or acquiring loans. The net deferred amount is amortized over the estimated lives of the related loans as an adjustment to the yield. 

Sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of the lease receivable, estimated unguaranteed residual values, and deferred initial direct fees and costs if certain criteria are met. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of the lease receivable, estimated unguaranteed residual values, and deferred initial direct fees and 

costs, less unearned income. Unearned income on direct financing leases is amortized over the lease terms using a method approximating the interest method that produces a constant rate of return. Deferred initial direct fees and costs for both sales-type and direct financing leases are amortized over the lease terms as an adjustment to the yield. 

The residual value component of a lease represents the fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. Residual values are reviewed at least annually to determine if an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. In the event of such a decline, the residual value is adjusted to its fair value. Impairment charges are included in the &#8220;provision for credit losses&#8221; and net gains or losses on sales of lease residuals are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. Additional information pertaining to the value of lease residuals is provided in Note 10 (&#8220; Leases &#8221;). 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale generally include certain residential and commercial mortgage loans, other commercial loans, and student loans. Loans are initially classified as held for sale when they are individually identified as being available for immediate sale and a formal plan exists to sell them. Loans held for sale are recorded at either fair value, if elected, or the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based on available market data for similar assets. When a loan is originated as held-for-sale, origination fees and costs are deferred but not amortized. Upon sale of the loans, deferred origination fees and costs are recognized as part of the calculated gain or loss on sale. Our commercial loans (including commercial mortgage and non-mortgage loans) and student loans, which we originated and intend to sell, are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Subsequent declines in fair value for loans held for sale are recognized as a charge to &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. Consumer real estate - residential mortgages loans have been elected to be carried at fair value. Subsequent increases and decreases in fair value for loans elected to be measured at fair value are recorded to &#8220;consumer mortgage income&#8221; on the income statement. Additional information regarding fair value measurements associated with our loans held for sale is provided in Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;). 

We may transfer certain loans to held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value. If a loan is transferred from the loan portfolio to the held-for-sale category, any write-down in the carrying amount of the loan at the date of transfer is recorded as a reduction in the ALLL. When a loan is transferred into the held for sale category, we stop amortizing the related deferred fees and costs. The remaining unamortized fees and costs are recognized as part of the cost basis of the loan at the time it is sold. We may also transfer loans from held for sale to the loan portfolio held for investment. If a loan held for sale for which fair value accounting was elected is transferred to held for investment, it will continue to be accounted for at fair value in the loan portfolio. 

Nonperforming Loans 

Nonperforming loans are loans for which we do not accrue interest income, and include commercial and consumer loans and leases as well as current year TDRs and nonaccruing TDR loans from prior years. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or PCI loans. 

We generally classify commercial loans as nonperforming and stop accruing interest (i.e., designate the loan &#8220;nonaccrual&#8221;) when the borrower&#8217;s principal or interest payment is 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when payment is not past due but we have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with existing repayment terms. Once a loan is designated nonaccrual (and as a result assessed for impairment), the interest accrued but not collected is generally charged against the ALLL, and payments subsequently received are applied to principal. Commercial loans are typically charged off in full or charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral when the borrower&#8217;s payment is 180 days past due. 

We classify consumer loans as nonperforming and stop accruing interest when the borrower&#8217;s payment is 120 days past due, unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Any second lien home equity loan with an associated first lien that is 120 days or more past due or in foreclosure, or for which the first mortgage delinquency timeframe is unknown, is reported as a nonperforming loan. Secured loans that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are designated as nonperforming and TDRs. Our charge-off policy for most consumer loans takes effect when payments are 120 days past due. Home equity and residential mortgage loans generally are charged down to net realizable value when payment is 180 days past due. Credit card loans and similar unsecured products continue to accrue interest until the account is charged off at 180 days past due. 

Commercial and consumer loans may be returned to accrual status if we are reasonably assured that all contractually due principal and interest are collectible and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period (generally six months ) of repayment performance under the contracted terms of the loan and applicable regulation. 

Impaired Loans 

A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 

All consumer TDRs, regardless of size, and all commercial TDRs and non-accrual commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $ 2.5 million or greater are individually evaluated for impairment and assigned a specific reserve. Commercial non-accrual loans of less than $ 2.5 million and all non-accrual consumer loans are aggregated and collectively evaluated for impairment. The amount of the reserve is estimated based on the criteria outlined in the &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses&#8221; section of this note. 

Purchased Loans 

Purchased performing loans that do not have evidence of deterioration in credit quality at acquisition are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Any premium or discount associated with purchased performing loans is recognized as interest income based on the effective yield method of amortization for term loans or the straight-line method of amortization for revolving loans. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required ALLL for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, we record a provision for loan and lease losses only when the required ALLL exceeds any remaining purchase discount at the product level. 

Purchased loans that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected, are deemed PCI. Revolving loans, including lines of credit and credit card loans, leases, and loans where cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated are excluded from PCI accounting. Purchased loans are initially recorded at fair value without recording an allowance for loan losses. Fair value of these loans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, as adjusted for an estimate of future credit losses and prepayments, and then a market-based discount rate is applied to those cash flows. PCI loans that have similar risk characteristics, primarily credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk, and are homogeneous in size, are pooled and accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PCI loans that cannot be aggregated into a pool are accounted for individually. 

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected, measured as of the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value is referred to as the &#8220;accretable yield&#8221; and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool using the effective yield method. Accordingly, PCI loans are not subject to classification as nonaccrual (and nonperforming) in the same manner as originated loans. Rather, acquired PCI loans are considered to be accruing loans because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized on the individual loan or pool and not to the contractual interest payments of the loan. The difference between the contractually required principal and interest payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the &#8220;nonaccretable difference.&#8221; The nonaccretable difference, which is not accreted into income, reflects estimated future credit losses and uncollectible contractual payments over the life of the PCI loan. 

After we acquire loans determined to be PCI loans, actual cash collections are monitored to determine if they conform to management&#8217;s expectations. Revised cash flow expectations are prepared each quarter. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate impairment and would require us to establish an ALLL by recording a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses. An increase in expected cash flows in subsequent periods initially reduces any previously established ALLL by the increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, and requires us to recalculate the amount of accretable yield for the PCI loan or pool. The adjustment of accretable yield due to an increase in expected cash flows is accounted for as a change in estimate. The additional cash flows expected to be collected are reclassified from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield, and the amount of periodic accretion is adjusted accordingly over the remaining life of the PCI loan or pool. 

A PCI loan may be derecognized either through receipt of payment (in full or in part) from the borrower, the sale of the loan to a third party, foreclosure of the collateral, or charge-off. If one of these events occurs, the loan is removed from the loan pool, or derecognized if it is accounted for as an individual loan. PCI loans subject to modification are not removed from a PCI pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed TDRs since the pool, and not the individual loan, represents the unit of account. Individually accounted for PCI loans that are modified in a TDR are no longer classified as PCI loans and are subject to TDR recognition. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

The ALLL represents our estimate of incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. We establish the amount of this allowance by analyzing the quality of the loan portfolio at least quarterly, and more often if deemed necessary. We segregate our loan portfolio between commercial and consumer loans and develop and document our methodology to determine the ALLL accordingly. We believe these portfolio segments represent the most appropriate level for determining our historical loss experience, as well as the level at which we monitor credit quality and risk characteristics of the portfolios. Commercial loans, which generally have larger individual balances, constitute a significant portion of our total loan portfolio. The consumer portfolio typically includes smaller-balance homogeneous loans. 

We estimate the appropriate level of our ALLL by applying expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. Expected loss rates for commercial loans are derived from a statistical analysis of our historical default and loss severity experience. The analysis utilizes probability of default and loss given default to assign loan grades using our internal risk rating system. Our expected loss rates are reviewed quarterly and updated as necessary. As of December 31, 2019 , the probability of default ratings was based on our default data and internal estimates for the period from January 2008 through October 2019, which encompasses the last downturn period as well as our more recent positive credit experience. We adjust expected loss rates based on calculated estimates of the average time period from initial loss indication to the initial loss recorded for an individual loan. 

Expected loss rates for consumer loans are statistically derived from an analysis of our historical default and loss severity experience, and is sensitive to change in delinquency status. Consumer loans are analyzed quarterly in homogeneous product-type pools that share similar risk attributes, including the application of delinquency roll rate models and credit loss severity estimates. Incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable are measured as the estimate of the average time period for initial loss indication to initial loss recorded for consumer loans. 

The ALLL may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of many qualitative factors that may not be directly measured in the statistical analysis of expected loss, including: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

changes in the experience, ability, and depth of our lending management and staff; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, including the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

changes in the volume and/or severity of past due, nonaccrual, and adversely classified or graded loans; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

external factors, such as competition, legal developments, and regulatory requirements. 

##TABLE_END For all consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, as well as all commercial TDRs and non-accrual commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $ 2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. We estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and TDRs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan&#8217;s observable market price. Secured consumer loan TDRs that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. Other consumer loan TDRs are assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate. A specific allowance also may be assigned &#8212; even when sources of repayment appear sufficient &#8212; if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. 

Liability for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The liability for credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, is included in &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities&#8221; on the balance sheet and established through a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses. We determine the amount of this liability by considering both historical trends and current market conditions quarterly, or more often if deemed necessary. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market. Therefore, fair value represents an exit price at the measurement date. We value our assets and liabilities based on the principal or most advantageous market where each would be sold (in the case of assets) or transferred (in the case of liabilities). In the absence of observable market transactions, we consider liquidity valuation adjustments to reflect the uncertainty in pricing the instruments. 

Valuation inputs can be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are assumptions based on market data obtained from an independent source. Unobservable inputs are assumptions based on our own information or assessment of assumptions used by other market participants in pricing the asset or liability. Our unobservable inputs are based on the best and most current information available on the measurement date. 

All inputs, whether observable or unobservable, are ranked in accordance with a prescribed fair value hierarchy that gives the highest ranking to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fair values for Level 2 assets and liabilities are based on one or a combination of the following factors: (i) quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) observable inputs, such as interest rates or yield curves; or (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The level in the fair value hierarchy ascribed to a fair value measurement in its entirety is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. Assets and liabilities may transfer between levels based on the observable and unobservable inputs used at the valuation date. 

Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments are typically recorded as a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting; or impairment. At a minimum, we conduct our valuations quarterly. 

Additional information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures is provided in Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;). 

Short-Term Investments 

Short-term investments consist of segregated, interest-bearing deposits due from banks, the Federal Reserve, and certain non-U.S. banks as well as reverse repurchase agreements. 

Trading Account Assets 

Trading account assets are debt and equity securities, as well as commercial loans, that we purchase and hold but intend to sell in the near term. These assets are reported at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading account assets are reported in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. 

Securities 

Securities available for sale. Debt securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs, or other factors are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method, are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. Unrealized gains and losses (net of income taxes) deemed temporary are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI. Other-than-temporary unrealized losses on debt securities are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement when the loss is attributable to credit. Other-than-temporary unrealized losses attributable to factors other than credit are recorded in AOCI. For additional information, refer to Note 7 (&#8220; Securities &#8221;). 

&#8220;Other securities&#8221; held in the available-for-sale portfolio consist of convertible preferred stock of privately held companies. 

Held-to-maturity securities. Debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method. This method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted carrying amount. &#8220;Other securities&#8221; held in the held-to-maturity portfolio consist of foreign bonds and capital securities. If any of the value of a held-to-maturity security is determined to be unrecoverable, impairment will be recorded. 

Other Investments 

Other investments include equity and mezzanine instruments as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at the alternative cost method. The alternative cost method results in these investments being recorded at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable market transactions. Adjustments are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. 

Derivatives and Hedging 

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; or &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities.&#8221; The net increase or decrease in derivatives is included in &#8220;other operating activities, net&#8221; within the statement of cash flows. Accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of derivatives differs depending on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedge relationship, and on the type of hedge relationship. For derivatives that are not in a hedge relationship, any gain or loss, as well as any premium paid or received, is recognized immediately in earnings in &#8220;corporate services income&#8221; or &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement, depending whether the derivative is for customer accommodation or risk management, respectively. A derivative that is designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument must be designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument are reflected in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. 

A fair value hedge is used to limit exposure to changes in the fair value of existing assets, liabilities, and commitments caused by changes in interest rates or other economic factors. The change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recorded in earnings at the same time as a change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. 

A cash flow hedge is used to minimize the variability of future cash flows that is caused by changes in interest rates or other economic factors. The gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded as a component of AOCI on the balance sheet and reclassified to earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., when we incur variable-rate interest on debt, earn variable-rate interest on loans, or sell commercial real estate loans). 

A net investment hedge is used to hedge the exposure of changes in the carrying value of investments as a result of changes in the related foreign exchange rates. The gain or loss on a net investment hedge is recorded as a component of AOCI on the balance sheet when the terms of the derivative match the notional and currency risk being hedged. The amount in AOCI is reclassified into income when the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., when we dispose or liquidate a foreign subsidiary). 

Hedge &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; is determined by the extent to which changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument offset changes in the fair value, cash flows, or carrying value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the relationship between the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in the hedged item falls within a range considered to be the industry norm, the hedge is considered &#8220;highly effective&#8221; and qualifies for hedge accounting. A hedge is &#8220;ineffective&#8221; if the relationship between the changes falls outside the acceptable range. In that case, hedge accounting is discontinued on a prospective basis. Hedge effectiveness is tested at least quarterly. 

We take into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral when recognizing derivative assets and liabilities. As a result, we could have derivative contracts with negative fair values included in derivative assets on the balance sheet and contracts with positive fair 

values included in derivative liabilities. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are recorded within &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; and &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities,&#8221; respectively. 

Additional information regarding the accounting for derivatives is provided in Note 8 (&#8220; Derivatives and Hedging Activities &#8221;). 

Loan Sales and Securitizations 

We sell and at times may securitize loans and other financial assets. We recognize the sale and securitization of loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. When we securitize loans or other financial assets, we may retain a portion of the securities issued, including senior interests, subordinated interests, interest-only strips, servicing rights, and other interests, all of which are considered retained interests in the transferred assets. The interests are initially measured at fair value which is based on independent third party market prices or market prices for similar assets. If market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and credit losses. Loans sold or securitized are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in &#8220;other income&#8221; at the time of sale. Gains or losses recognized depend on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. 

Servicing Assets 

We service commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. Servicing assets and liabilities purchased or retained are initially measured at fair value and are recorded as a component of &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; on the balance sheet. When no ready market value (such as quoted market prices, or prices based on sales or purchases of similar assets) is available to determine the fair value of servicing assets, fair value is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. This calculation is based on a number of assumptions, including the market cost of servicing, the discount rate, the prepayment rate, and the default rate. 

We account for our servicing assets using the amortization method. The amortization of servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income and recorded in &#8220;mortgage servicing fees&#8221; on the income statement. 

Servicing assets are evaluated quarterly for possible impairment. This process involves stratifying the assets based upon one or more predominant risk characteristics and determining the fair value of each class. The characteristics may include financial asset type, size, interest rate, date of origination, term and geographic location. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the servicing assets exceeds their fair value, the carrying amount is reduced by recording a charge to income in the amount of such excess and establishing a valuation reserve allowance. If impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, a direct write-off of the carrying amount would be recorded. Additional information pertaining to servicing assets is included in Note 9 (&#8220; Mortgage Servicing Assets &#8221;). 

Leases 

For leases where Key is the lessee that have initial terms greater than one year, right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are reported on the balance sheet. Leases with an initial term of less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our leases where Key is the lessee are primarily classified as operating leases. Operating lease expense is recognized in "net occupancy" and "equipment"on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For additional information, see Note 10 (&#8220; Leases &#8221;). 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We determine depreciation of premises and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the particular assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful lives or terms of the leases. Premises and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their f air value. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the acquisition date based on the expected benefit to such reporting unit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment, at least annually as of October 1, or when indicators of impairment exist. 

We may elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass this qualitative analysis, or conclude via qualitative analysis that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the reporting unit's goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then the second step is performed, which measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value. If the implied fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. 

The amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on risk-based regulatory capital requirements. Fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches. The market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity. The income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions. A multi-year internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry. Earnings projections for reporting units are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant. The discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the CAPM. The buildup to the discount rate includes a risk-free rate, 5-year adjusted beta based on peer companies, a market equity risk premium, a size premium and a company specific risk premium. The discount rates differ between our reporting units as they have different levels of risk. A sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions, such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates. 

Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis . We monitor for impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets on a quarterly basis. Additional information pertaining to goodwill and other intangible assets is included in Note 12 (&#8220; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets &#8221;). 

Business Combinations 

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this accounting method, the acquired company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance, and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with Key&#8217;s results from the date of acquisition forward. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) is recorded as goodwill. Our accounting policy for intangible assets is summarized in this note under the heading &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#8221; 

Additional information regarding acquisitions is provided in Note 15 (&#8220; Acquisitions, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations &#8221;). 

Securities Financing Activities 

We enter into repurchase agreements to finance overnight customer sweep deposits. We also enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements to settle other securities obligations. We account for these securities financing agreements as collateralized financing transactions. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts that the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts of cash collateral advanced. While our securities financing agreements incorporate a right of set off, the assets and liabilities are reported on a gross basis. Reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are included in &#8220;short-term investments&#8221; on the balance sheet; repurchase agreements are included in &#8220;federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.&#8221; Fees received in connection with these transactions are recorded in interest income; fees paid are recorded in interest expense. 

Additional information regarding securities financing activities is included in Note 16 (&#8220; Securities Financing Activities &#8221;). 

Contingencies and Guarantees 

We recognize liabilities for the fair value of our obligations under certain guarantees issued. These liabilities are included in &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities&#8221; on the balance sheet. If we receive a fee for a guarantee requiring liability recognition, the amount of the fee represents the initial fair value of the &#8220;stand ready&#8221; obligation. If there is no fee, the fair value of the stand ready obligation is determined using expected present value measurement techniques, unless observable transactions for comparable guarantees are available. The subsequent accounting for these stand ready obligations depends on the nature of the underlying guarantees. We account for our release from risk under a particular guarantee when the guarantee expires or is settled, or by a systematic and rational amortization method, depending on the risk profile of the guarantee. 

Contingent liabilities may result from litigation, claims and assessments, loss or damage to Key. We recognize liabilities from contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 

Additional information regarding contingencies and guarantees is included in Note 22 (&#8220; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees &#8221;). 

Revenue Recognition 

We recognize revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. Our principal source of revenue is interest income from loans and investments. We also earn noninterest income from various banking and financial services offered through both the Commercial and Consumer banks. 

Interest Income. The largest source of revenue for us is interest income. Interest income is primarily recognized on an accrual basis according to nondiscretionary formulas in written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts. 

Noninterest Income. We earn noninterest income through a variety of financial and transaction services provided to commercial and consumer clients. Revenue is recorded for noninterest income based on the contractual terms for the service or transaction performed. In certain circumstances, noninterest income is reported net of associated expenses. 

Trust and Investment Services Income. Trust and investment services revenues include brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions. 

Revenue from trade execution and brokerage services is earned through commissions from trade execution on behalf of clients. Revenue from these transactions is recognized at the trade date. Any ongoing service fees are recognized on a monthly basis as services are performed. 

Trust and asset management services include asset custody and investment management services provided to individual and institutional customers. Revenue is recognized monthly based on a minimum annual fee, and the market value of assets in custody. Additional fees are recognized for transactional activity at a point in time. 

Investment Banking and Debt Placement Fees. Investment banking and debt placement fees primarily represent revenues earned by KeyBanc Capital Markets for various corporate services including advisory, debt placement and underwriting. Revenues for these services are recorded at a point in time, upon completion of a contractually identified transaction, or when an advisory opinion is provided. Investment banking and debt placement costs are reported on a gross basis within other expense on the income statement. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts is earned through cash management, wire transfer, and other deposit-related services as well as overdraft, non-sufficient funds, account management and other deposit-related fees. Revenue is recognized for these services either over time, corresponding with deposit accounts&#8217; monthly cycle, or at a point in time for transactional related services and fees. Certain reward costs are netted within revenues from service charges on deposits. 

Corporate Services Income. Corporate services income includes various ancillary service revenue including letter of credit fees, loan fees, and certain capital market fees. Revenue from these fees is recorded in a manner that reflects the timing of when transactions occur, and as services are provided. 

Cards and Payments income. Cards and payments income includes interchange fees from consumer credit and debit cards processed through card association networks, merchant services, and other card related services. Interchange rates are generally set by the credit card associations and based on purchase volumes and other factors. Interchange fees are recognized as transactions occur. Certain card network costs and reward costs are netted within interchange revenues. Merchant services income represents account management fees and transaction fees charged to merchants for the processing of card association network transactions. Merchant services revenue is recognized as transactions occur, or as services are performed. 

Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Income. Income from corporate-owned life insurance primarily represents changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies held on certain key employees. Revenue is recognized in each period based on the change in the cash surrender value during the period. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

Stock-based compensation is measured using the fair value method of accounting on the grant date. The measured cost is recognized over the period during which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We estimate expected forfeitures when stock-based awards are granted and record compensation expense only for awards that are expected to vest. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees is recorded in &#8220;personnel expense&#8221; on the Consolidated Statements of Income while compensation expense related to awards granted to directors is recorded in &#8220;other expense.&#8221; 

We recognize compensation expense for stock-based, mandatory deferred incentive compensation awards using the accelerated method of amortization over a period of approximately 5 years (the current year performance period and a four -year vesting period, which generally starts in the first quarter following the performance period). 

We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, as further described in Note 17 (&#8220; Stock-Based Compensation &#8221;). Employee stock options typically become exercisable at the rate of 25 % per year, beginning one year after the grant date. Options expire no later than 10 years after their grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options with graded vesting using an accelerated method of amortization. 

We use shares repurchased under our annual capital plan submitted to our regulators (treasury shares) for share issuances under all stock-based compensation programs. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement asset and liability amounts and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as tax credit and net operating 

loss carryforwards. The net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is reported in &#8220;Accrued income and other assets&#8221; or &#8220;Accrued expense and other liabilities&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. Subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the provision for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic net income per common share is calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (distributed earnings) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Distributed and undistributed earnings are allocated between common and participating security shareholders 

based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities (e.g., nonvested service-based restricted stock units). Undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted shareholders, as these shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to fund the incurred losses. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 

Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. The dilutive calculation considers the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents determined under the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalents include stock options and service- and performance-based restricted stock and stock units granted under our stock plans. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the total of weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.

January 1, 2020 

The ASUs amend ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, and significantly change how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard replaces today&#8217;s &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; approach with an &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model for instruments such as loans and held-to-maturity securities that are measured at amortized cost. The standard requires credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance rather than a reduction of the carrying amount. It also changes the accounting for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. The ASUs retain many of the current disclosure requirements in current GAAP and expand certain disclosure requirements. The new guidance also allows optional relief for certain instruments measured at amortized cost with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments. 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , using the modified retrospective method. This new guidance affects the accounting for our loans, debt securities held to maturity and available for sale, and liabilities for credit losses on unfunded lending related commitments as well as purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination. Our cross-functional implementation team, including finance, credit, and modeling, has completed the development and testing of loss forecasting models, including establishment of macroeconomic forecasting methodologies and approaches to meet the requirements of the new guidance. We completed parallel runs through the third and fourth quarters of 2019. We utilized a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period for all portfolio segments and reverted to our historical loss experience outside of the forecast period over 1 year, leveraging historical macroeconomic variables. Based on our expectations of macroeconomic forecasts and our loans and net investment in leases as of January 1, 2020, we expect the allowance for loan and lease losses to increase by approximately 20% to 25% as compared to our current reserve levels as a result of the adoption of this guidance. The estimated allowance for loan and lease losses on longer duration consumer loans and lines of credit is expected to more than triple to cover the full remaining expected life of loans and commitments. The estimated overall increase is offset by an expected decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses for our shorter duration commercial loans and leases. We do not expect to record an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities as a result of the adoption of this guidance. The allowance for credit losses to be recorded at the January 1, 2020 transition date may differ from our estimate due to finalization of certain accounting, reporting, and governance processes. 

ASU 2017-04, 

Simplifying the 

Test for Goodwill 

Impairment 

January 1, 2020 

The ASU amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - 

Goodwill and Other and eliminates the second step of the test for goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, entities will compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value, the entity is required to recognize an impairment charge for this amount. The new method applies to all reporting units and the performance of a qualitative assessment is still allowable. 

The guidance should be implemented using a 

prospective approach. 

We will monitor for impairment indicators and conduct our annual goodwill test as of October 1, 2020. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements ASU 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842): Narrow Scope Improvements for Lessors ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 

January 1, 2019 

The ASUs create and amend ASC Topic 842, Leases, and supersede Topic 840, Leases. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Leveraged leases that commenced before the effective date of the new guidance are grandfathered. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, both types of leases are required to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASC 842 requires enhanced disclosures to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Although substantially unchanged, certain amendments provide clarifications related to lessor accounting. The guidance should be implemented using a modified retrospective approach. However, entities may choose to measure and present the changes at the beginning of the earliest period presented or to reflect the changes as of the adoption date. 

Key adopted this guidance on January 1, 2019, using the package of practical expedients, which allowed Key to maintain historic lease identification and classification, and permitted Key not to reassess initial direct costs under the new guidance. Key also elected the practical expedient on not separating lease components from nonlease components for all of its leases. Adoption resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities arising from operating leases in which Key is the lessee of approximately $710 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 1, 2019. Right of use assets, lease liabilities, and other changes as a result of adoption are not reflected in comparable periods presented prior to that date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the recognition of operating lease expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount of the right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities recorded at adoption was based on the present value of unpaid future minimum lease payments. These payments were discounted using Key&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate, consistent with what Key would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a term similar to each lease. For more information, please see Note 10 (&#8220;Leases&#8221;).

the amortization period to the earliest call date for 

certain callable debt securities held at a premium. 

Securities held at a discount will continue to be

An entity is 

permitted to early 

adopt any 

removed or 

modified 

disclosures upon 

issuance of this 

ASU and delay 

adoption of the 

additional 

disclosures until 

their effective 

date. 

The ASU amends disclosure requirements related to 

fair value measurements. Specifically, entities are no 

longer required to disclose transfers between Level 1 

and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or qualitatively 

disclose the valuation process for Level 3 fair value 

measurements. The updated guidance requires 

disclosure of the changes in unrealized gains and 

losses for the period included in Other Comprehensive 

Income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements. 

Entities also will be required to disclose the range and 

weighted average used to develop significant 

unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value 

measurements. 

The additional provisions of the guidance should be 

adopted prospectively, while the eliminated 

requirements should be adopted retrospectively. 

Key removed the disclosures no longer required by the guidance as of September 30, 2018, and early adopted the additional provisions of the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard did not result in significant changes to Key&#8217;s disclosures, and there was no effect to our financial condition or results of operations.

The ASU amends the disclosure requirements for sponsors of defined benefit plans. Entities are required to provide new disclosures, including the weighted-average interest crediting rate for cash balance plans and explanations for the significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. Certain existing disclosure requirements are eliminated. 

The guidance should be adopted using a retrospective approach. 

The adoption of this accounting guidance did not result in significant changes to our disclosures, and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

The ASU amends ASC Topic 350-40 to align the accounting for costs incurred in a cloud computing 

arrangement with the guidance on developing internal 

use software. Specifically, if a cloud computing arrangement is deemed to be a service contract, 

certain implementation costs are eligible for capitalization. The new guidance prescribes the 

balance sheet and income statement presentation and 

cash flow classification for the capitalized costs and 

related amortization expense. It also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. 

The guidance may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively.

issues related to partial-term fair value hedges, fair 

value hedge basis adjustments, and how to measure 

changes in fair value of a hedged item. It also clarifies 

certain issues related to equity securities and the 

measurement alternative. 

Amendments related to ASU 2016-01 should be 

adopted using a modified retrospective approach, 

except for those related to equity securities without 

readily determinable fair values for which the 

measurement alternative is elected, which should be 

applied prospectively. We elected to apply amendments related to ASU 2017-12 on a prospective basis. 

Key early adopted this guidance effective May 1, 2019. The 

adoption of this accounting guidance did not effect our financial 

condition or results of operations.

2. Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on our preferred stock) available to each Common Share outstanding during the reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each Common Share outstanding during the reporting periods adjusted to include the effects of potentially dilutive Common Shares. Potentially dilutive Common Shares include stock options and other stock-based awards. Potentially dilutive Common Shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive. 

Our basic and diluted earnings per Common Share are calculated as follows:

3. Restrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities 

Federal law requires a depository institution to maintain a prescribed amount of cash or deposit reserve balances with its Federal Reserve Bank. KeyBank maintained average reserve balances aggregating $ 377 million in 2019 to fulfill these requirements. Currently KeyBank meets the required reserve balances with vault cash, therefore any cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve is not restricted. 

Capital distributions from KeyBank and other subsidiaries are our principal source of cash flows for paying dividends on our common and preferred shares, servicing our debt, and financing corporate operations. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank&#8217;s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the previous two calendar years and for the current year, up to the date the dividend is declared. 

During 2019 , KeyBank paid $ 1.2 billion in dividends to KeyCorp. At January 1, 2020 , KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $ 920 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2019 , KeyCorp held $ 3.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, which can be used to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt, and finance corporate operations.

5. Asset Quality 

We assess the credit quality of the loan portfolio by monitoring net credit losses, levels of nonperforming assets and delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by management. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

The prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the regulatory risk ratings assigned for the consumer loan portfolios. 

Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by credit risk management, and periodically re-evaluated thereafter. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial 

strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower&#8217;s management, the borrower&#8217;s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure, and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.

##TABLE_END For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 , and December 31, 2017 , interest income recognized on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans totaled $ 14 million , $ 13 million , and $ 9 million , respectively. 

TDRs 

We classify loan modifications as TDRs when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and we have granted a concession without commensurate financial, structural, or legal consideration. Acquired loans that were previously modified by First Niagara in a TDR are no longer classified as TDRs at the Acquisition Date. An acquired loan may only be classified as a TDR if a modification meeting the above TDR criteria is performed after the Acquisition Date. PCI loans cannot be classified as TDRs. All commercial and consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, are individually evaluated for impairment to determine the probable loss content and are assigned a specific loan allowance. This designation has the effect of moving the loan from the general reserve methodology (i.e., collectively evaluated) to the specific reserve methodology (i.e., individually evaluated) and may impact the ALLL through a charge-off or increased loan loss provision. These components affect the ultimate allowance level. 

As TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment under the specific reserve methodology, subsequent defaults do not generally have a significant additional impact on the ALLL. Commitments outstanding to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs are $ 4 million and $ 5 million at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , respectively. 

Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. The consumer TDR other concession category primarily includes those borrowers&#8217; debts that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been formally re-affirmed. At December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , the recorded investment of loans secured by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure was approximately $ 97 million and $ 113 million , respectively. At December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , we had $ 35 million and $ 35 million , respectively, of OREO which included the carrying value of foreclosed residential real estate of approximately $ 34 million and $ 35 million , respectively. 

The following table shows the period-end post-modification outstanding recorded investment by concession type for our commercial and consumer accruing and nonaccruing TDRs added during the periods indicated:

##TABLE_END 

Commercial loan TDRs are considered defaulted when principal and interest payments are 90 days past due. Consumer loan TDRs are considered defaulted when principal and interest payments are more than 60 days past due. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , there were no commercial loan TDR and 356 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $ 8 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2018 . During the year ended December 31, 2018 , there were one commercial loan TDRs and 253 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $ 11 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2017 . During the year ended December 31, 2017 , there were no commercial loan TDRs and 147 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $ 4 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2016 . 

ALLL and Liability for Credit Losses on Unfunded Lending-Related Commitments 

We determine the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology is described in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.&#8221; 

The ALLL on the acquired non-impaired loan portfolio is estimated using the same methodology as the originated portfolio, however, the estimated ALLL is compared to the remaining accretable yield to determine if an ALLL must be recorded. For PCI loans, Key estimates cash flows expected to be collected quarterly. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in the ALLL. 

The changes in the ALLL by loan category for the periods indicated are as follows: ##TABLE_START in millions

Amount includes $ 2 million of loans carried at fair value that are excluded from ALLL consideration. 

##TABLE_END The liability for credit losses inherent in lending-related unfunded commitments, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, is included in &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities&#8221; on the balance sheet. We establish the amount of this reserve by considering both historical trends and current market conditions quarterly, or more often if deemed necessary. 

Changes in the liability for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments are summarized as follows:

Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in our principal market. Additional information regarding our accounting policies for determining fair value is provided in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Fair Value Measurements.&#8221; 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 .

##TABLE_START (a) 

Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) 

Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments.

Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques 

The following table describes the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to measure the classes of assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the classification of each within the valuation hierarchy. 

##TABLE_START Asset/liability class 

Valuation technique 

Valuation hierarchy classification(s) 

Securities (trading account assets and available for sale) 

Fair value of level 1 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Quoted market prices available in an active market for identical securities. This includes exchange-traded equity securities. 

Fair value of level 2 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Pricing models (either by a third party pricing service or internally). Inputs include: yields, benchmark securities, bids, offers, actual trade data (i.e., spreads, credit ratings, and interest rates) for comparable assets, spread tables, matrices, high-grade scales, and option-adjusted spreads. 

&#8226; Observable market prices of similar securities. 

Fair value of level 3 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Internal models, principally discounted cash flow models (income approach). 

&#8226; Revenue multiples of comparable public companies (market approach). 

For level 3 securities, increases in the discount rate applied in the discounted cash flow models would negatively affect the fair value. Increases in valuation multiples of comparable companies would positively affect the fair value. 

The valuations provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data obtained from market research publications. Inputs used by the third-party pricing service in valuing CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities also include new issue data, monthly payment information, whole loan collateral performance, and &#8220;To Be Announced&#8221; prices. In valuations of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, inputs used by the third-party pricing service also include material event notices. 

Level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily Level 2) 

Commercial loans (trading account assets) 

Fair value is based on: 

&#8226; Observable market price spreads for similar loans. Valuations reflect prices within the bid-ask spread that are most representative of fair value. 

Level 2 

Principal investments (direct) 

Direct principal investments consist of equity and debt instruments of private companies made by our principal investing entities. Fair value is determined using: 

&#8226; Operating performance and market multiples of comparable businesses 

&#8226; Other unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment 

Direct principal investments are accounted for as investment companies in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period&#8217;s earnings. 

We are in the process of winding down our direct principal investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, the balance is less than $1 million. 

Level 3 

Principal investments (indirect) 

Indirect principal investments include primary and secondary investments in private equity funds engaged mainly in venture- and growth-oriented investing. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership interest in partners&#8217; capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed). 

Indirect principal investments are also accounted for as investment companies, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period&#8217;s earnings. 

Under the provisions of the Volcker Rule, we are required to dispose or conform our indirect investments to the requirements of the statute by no later than July 21, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.

##TABLE_START (a) 

Our direct investments consist of equity and debt investments directly in independent business enterprises. Operations of the business enterprises are handled by management of the portfolio company. The purpose of funding these enterprises is to provide financial support for business development and acquisition strategies. We infuse equity capital based on an initial contractual cash contribution and later from additional requests on behalf of the companies&#8217; management. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) 

Our indirect investments consist of buyout funds, venture capital funds, and fund of funds. These investments are generally not redeemable. Instead, distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying investments of the fund. An investment in any one of these funds typically can be sold only with the approval of the fund&#8217;s general partners. At December 31, 2019 , no significant liquidation of the underlying investments has been communicated to Key. The purpose of funding our capital commitments to these investments is to allow the funds to make additional follow-on investments and pay fund expenses until the fund dissolves. We, and all other investors in the fund, are obligated to fund the full amount of our respective capital commitments to the fund based on our and their respective ownership percentages, as noted in the applicable Limited Partnership Agreement.

Fair value is determined using: 

&#8226; Discounted cash flows 

&#8226; Operating performance and market/exit multiples of comparable businesses 

&#8226; Other unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment 

For level 3 securities, increases in the discount rate applied in the discounted cash flow models would negatively affect the fair value. Increases in valuation multiples of comparable companies would positively affect the fair value. Level 2 investments reflect the price of recent investments, which is deemed representative of fair value. 

Level 2 and 3 

Other direct and indirect equity investments (NAV) 

Certain direct investments do not have readily determinable fair values and qualify for the practical expedient in the accounting guidance that allows us to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share.

Loans held for sale and held for investment (residential) 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale are accounted for at fair value. Fair values are based on: 

&#8226; Quoted market prices, where available 

&#8226; Prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics 

&#8226; Purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants 

Prices are adjusted as necessary to include: 

&#8226; The embedded servicing value in the loans 

&#8226; The specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. (These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans.) 

Residential loans held for investment: Certain residential loans held for sale contain salability exceptions that make them unable to be sold into the performing loan sales market. Loans in this category are transferred to the held to maturity loan portfolio and are included in &#8220;Loans, net of unearned income&#8221; on the balance sheet. This type of loan is classified as level 3 in the valuation hierarchy as transaction details regarding sales of this type of loan are often unavailable. 

Fair value is based upon: 

&#8226; Unobservable bid information from brokers and investors 

Level 1, 2 and 3 (primarily level 2) 

Derivatives 

Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted prices in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 1 instruments. 

The majority of our derivative positions are level 2 and are valued using internally developed models based on market convention and observable market inputs. These derivative contracts include interest rate swaps, certain options, floors, cross currency swaps, credit default swaps, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. Significant inputs used in the valuation models include: 

&#8226; Interest rate curves 

&#8226; Yield curves 

&#8226; LIBOR and Overnight Index Swap (OIS) discount rates 

&#8226; LIBOR and OIS curves, index pricing curves, foreign currency curves 

&#8226; Volatility surfaces (a three-dimensional graph of implied volatility against strike price and maturity) 

&#8226; Current prices for mortgage securities and investor supplied prices 

Level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily level 2) 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START Asset/liability class 

Valuation technique 

Valuation hierarchy classification(s) 

Derivatives (continued) 

We have several customized derivative instruments and risk participations that are classified as Level 3 instruments. These derivative positions are valued using internally developed models, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as: 

&#8226; Bond spreads and asset values 

The unobservable internally derived assumptions include: 

&#8226; Loss given default 

&#8226; Internal risk ratings of customers and the remaining term of the underlying transactions 

The fair value represents an estimate of the amount that the risk participation counterparty would need to pay/receive as of the measurement date based on the probability of customer default on the swap transaction and the fair value of the underlying customer swap. Therefore, a higher loss probability and a lower credit rating would negatively affect the fair value of the risk participations and a lower loss probability and higher credit rating would positively affect the fair value of the risk participations. 

We use interest rate lock commitments for our residential mortgage business, which are classified as Level 3 instruments. The significant components of the valuation model include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Interest rates observable in the market 

&#8226; Observable market prices for similar securities 

&#8226; The probability of the loan closing (i.e. the "pull-through" amount, a significant unobservable input). Increases in the probability of the loan closing would positively affect the fair value. 

Valuation of residential mortgage forward sale commitments utilizes observable market prices of comparable commitments and mortgage securities (Level 2). 

Level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily level 2) 

Liability for short positions 

This includes fixed income securities held by our broker dealer in its trading inventory. Fair value of level 1 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Quoted market prices available in an active market for identical securities 

Fair value of level 2 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Observable market prices of similar securities 

&#8226; Market activity, spreads, credit ratings and interest rates for each security type 

Level 1 and 2 

##TABLE_END

Market convention implies a credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; equivalent in the pricing of derivative contracts, which assumes all counterparties have the same creditworthiness. To reflect the actual exposure on our derivative contracts related to both counterparty and our own creditworthiness, we record a fair value adjustment. The credit component considers master netting and collateral agreements and is determined by the individual counterparty based on potential future exposures, expected recovery rates, and market-implied probabilities of default. 

We also make liquidity valuation adjustments to the fair value of certain assets to reflect the uncertainty in the pricing and trading of the instruments when we are unable to observe recent market transactions for identical or similar instruments. Liquidity valuation adjustments are based on the following factors: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the amount of time since the last relevant valuation; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

whether there is an actual trade or relevant external quote available at the measurement date; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

volatility associated with the primary pricing components. 

##TABLE_END We regularly validate the pricing methodologies of valuations derived from a third-party pricing service to ensure the fair value determination is consistent with the applicable accounting guidance and that our assets are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. To perform this validation, we: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

review documentation received from our third-party pricing service regarding the inputs used in its valuations and determine a level assessment for each category of securities; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

substantiate actual inputs used for a sample of securities by comparing the actual inputs used by our third-party pricing service to comparable inputs for similar securities; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

substantiate the fair values determined for a sample of securities by comparing the fair values provided by our third-party pricing service to prices from other independent sources for the same and similar securities. We 

##TABLE_END 

analyze variances and conduct additional research with our third-party pricing service and take appropriate steps based on our findings.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . The following table presents our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 : ##TABLE_START &#160;

Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques 

The following table describes the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to measure the significant classes of assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as well as the classification of each within the valuation hierarchy. 

##TABLE_START Asset/liability class 

Valuation technique 

Valuation hierarchy classification(s) 

Impaired loans and leases 

Loans are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis; impairment typically occurs when there is evidence of a probable loss and the expected value of the loan is less than the contractual value of the loan. The amount of the impairment may be determined based on the estimated present value of future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral, or the loan&#8217;s observable market price based on recent sales of similar loans and collateral. 

&#160; 

Cash flow analysis considers internally developed inputs including: 

&#8226; Discount rates 

&#8226; Default rates 

&#8226; Costs of foreclosure 

&#8226; Changes in collateral values 

The fair value of the underlying collateral, which may take the form of real estate or personal property, is based on internal estimates, field observations, and assessments provided by third-party appraisers. We perform or reaffirm appraisals of collateral-dependent impaired loans at least annually. Appraisals may occur more frequently if the most recent appraisal does not accurately reflect the current market, the debtor is seriously delinquent or chronically past due, or there has been a material deterioration in the performance of the project or condition of the property. Adjustments to outdated appraisals that result in an appraisal value less than the carrying amount of a collateral-dependent impaired loan are reflected in the ALLL. 

Impaired loans with a specifically allocated allowance based on a cash flow analysis or the value of the underlying collateral are classified as Level 3 assets. Impaired loans with a specifically allocated allowance based on an observable market price that reflects recent sale transactions for similar loans and collateral are classified as Level 2 assets. We adjust the carrying amount of our impaired loans when there is evidence of probable loss and the expected fair value of the loan is less than its contractual amount. 

Level 2 and 3 

Commercial loans held for sale 

Through a quarterly analysis of our loan portfolios held for sale, which include both performing and nonperforming commercial loans, we determine any adjustments necessary to record the portfolios at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with GAAP. Valuation inputs include: 

&#8226; Non-binding bids for the respective loans or similar loans 

&#8226; Recent sales transactions 

&#8226; Internal models that emulate recent securitizations 

Level 2 and 3 

Direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale 

Valuations of direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale are performed using an internal model that relies on market data, including: 

&#8226; Swap rates and bond ratings 

&#8226; Our own assumptions about the exit market for the leases 

&#8226; Details about the individual leases in the portfolio 

KEF has master sale and assignment agreements with numerous institutional investors. Historically, multiple quotes are obtained, with the most reasonable formal quotes retained. These nonbinding quotes generally lead to a sale to one of the parties who provided the quote. Leases for which we receive a current nonbinding bid, and for which the sale is considered probable, may be classified as Level 2. The validity of these quotes is supported by historical and continued dealings with institutions that have fulfilled the nonbinding quote in the past. 

&#160; 

Valuations of lease and operating lease assets held for sale that employ our own assumptions are classified as Level 3 assets. Inputs utilized include changes in the value of leased items and internal credit ratings. In an inactive market, we value assets held for sale through discounted cash flows models that utilize the current buy rate as the discount rate. Buy rates are based on the credit premium inherent in the relevant bond index and the the appropriate swap rate on the measurement date. 

Level 2 and 3 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START Asset/liability class 

Valuation technique 

Valuation hierarchy classification(s) 

OREO and other repossessed personal property (a) 

OREO and other repossessed properties are valued based on: 

&#8226; Appraisals and third-party price opinions, less estimated selling costs 

Generally, we classify these assets as Level 3, but OREO and other repossessed properties for which we receive binding purchase agreements are classified as Level 2. Returned lease inventory is valued based on market data for similar assets and is classified as Level 2. 

Assets that are acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures are recorded initially as held for sale at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure. After foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically, and current market conditions may require the assets to be marked down further to a new cost basis. 

Level 2 and 3 

LIHTC, HTC, and NMTC investments (a) 

LIHTC, HTC and NMTC operating partnerships are subject to quarterly impairment testing. This evaluation involves measuring the present value of future tax benefits and comparing that value against the current carrying value of the investment. 

Expected future tax benefit schedules are provided by the partnerships&#8217; general partners on a quarterly basis. These future benefits are discounted to their present value using discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium. LIHTC and HTC investments are impaired when it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the investment will not be realized. 

Level 3 

Other equity investments 

We have other investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share. We have elected to measure these securities at cost less impairment plus or minus adjustments due to observable orderly transactions. 

Impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the recorded cost. At each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative. At December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of equity investments recorded under this method was $134 million. Impairments of less than $1 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions 

##TABLE_START (a) 

Fair value equals or approximates carrying amount. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity does not take into consideration the value ascribed to core deposit intangibles. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

Information pertaining to our methodology for measuring the fair values of these assets and liabilities is included in the sections entitled &#8220;Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques&#8221; and &#8220;Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis&#8221; in this Note. Investments accounted for under the cost method (or cost less impairment adjusted for observable price changes for certain equity investments) are classified as Level 3 assets. These investments are not actively traded in an open market as sales for these types of investments are rare. The carrying amount of the investments carried at cost are adjusted for declines in value if they are considered to be other-than-temporary (or due to observable orderly transactions of the same issuer for equity investments eligible for the cost less impairment measurement alternative). These adjustments are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) 

Fair values of held-to-maturity securities are determined by using models that are based on security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities, and certain prepayment assumptions. We review the valuations derived from the models to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) 

The fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows. The projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows, taking into account the loan type, maturity of the loan, liquidity risk, servicing costs, and a required return on debt and capital. In addition, an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans, using historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions as a benchmark. The fair value of loans includes lease financing receivables at their aggregate carrying amount, which is equivalent to their fair value. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) 

Fair values of time deposits and long-term debt are based on discounted cash flows utilizing relevant market inputs. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) 

Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (g) 

Derivative assets-hedging and derivative liabilities-hedging includes both cash flow and fair value hedges. Additional information regarding our accounting policies for cash flow and fair value hedges is provided in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; 

##TABLE_END &#160; 

We determine fair value based on assumptions pertaining to the factors that a market participant would consider in valuing the asset. A substantial portion of our fair value adjustments are related to liquidity. During 2018 and 2019 , the fair values of our loan portfolios generally remained stable, primarily due to sustained liquidity in the loan markets. If we were to use different assumptions, the fair values shown in the preceding table could change. Also, because the applicable accounting guidance for financial instruments excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements, the fair value amounts shown in the table above do not, by themselves, represent the underlying value of our company as a whole. 

Discontinued assets - education lending business . Our discontinued assets include government-guaranteed and private education loans originated through our education lending business that was discontinued in September 2009. This portfolio consists of loans recorded at carrying value with appropriate valuation reserves and loans in portfolio recorded at fair value. All of these loans were excluded from the table above as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Loans at carrying value, net of allowance, of $ 855 million ( $ 729 million at fair value) at December 31, 2019 , and $ 1.1 billion ( $ 890 million at fair value) at December 31, 2018 ; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Portfolio loans at fair value of $ 2 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 2 million at December 31, 2018 . 

##TABLE_END 

These loans and securities are classified as Level 3 because we rely on unobservable inputs when determining fair value since observable market data is not available. 

Short-term financial instruments. For financial instruments with a remaining average life to maturity of less than six months, carrying amounts were used as an approximation of fair values. 

7. Securities 

The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and approximate fair value of our securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities are presented in the following tables. Gross unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities on the balance sheet as of the dates indicated. Accordingly, the amount of these gains and losses may change in the future as market conditions change.

At December 31, 2019 , gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for U.S. Treasury, Agencies, and Corporations and agency residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale with a loss duration of less than 12 months and less than $ 1 million for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and other securities held-to-maturity with a loss duration of less than 12 months. At December 31, 2019 , gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for U.S. Treasury, Agencies, and Corporations securities available for sale with a loss duration greater than 12 months or longer. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

At December 31, 2018 , gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for agency residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale with a loss duration of less than 12 months and less than $ 1 million for agency commercial mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity with a loss duration of less than 12 months. 

##TABLE_END 

At December 31, 2019 , we had $ 71 million of gross unrealized losses related to 240 fixed-rate agency residential CMOs that we invested in as part of our overall A/LM strategy. These securities had a weighted-average maturity of 3.79 years at December 31, 2019 . At December 31, 2019 , we also had $ 4 million of gross unrealized losses related to 186 agency residential mortgage-backed securities positions and $ 40 million of gross unrealized losses related to 27 agency commercial mortgage-backed securities positions with weighted-average maturities of 3.59 and 4.25 years, respectively, at December 31, 2019 . Because these securities have a fixed interest rate, their fair value is sensitive to movements in market interest rates. These unrealized losses are considered temporary since we 

expect to collect all contractually due amounts from these securities. Accordingly, these investments were reduced to their fair value through OCI, not earnings. 

We regularly assess our securities portfolio for OTTI. The assessments are based on the nature of the securities, the underlying collateral, the financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of the loss, our intent related to the individual securities, and the likelihood that we will have to sell securities prior to expected recovery. We did no t have any impairment losses recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

Realized gains and losses related to securities available for sale were as follows:

8. Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

We are a party to various derivative instruments, mainly through our subsidiary, KeyBank. The primary derivatives that we use are interest rate swaps, caps, floors, forwards and futures; foreign exchange contracts; commodity derivatives; and credit derivatives. These instruments help us manage exposure to interest rate risk, mitigate the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and meet client financing and hedging needs. As further discussed in this note: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

interest rate risk is the risk that the EVE or net interest income will be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

foreign exchange risk is the risk that an exchange rate will adversely affect the fair value of a financial instrument. 

##TABLE_END At December 31, 2019 , after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had $ 65 million of derivative assets and $ 4 million of derivative liabilities that relate to contracts entered into for hedging purposes. As of the same date, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and a reserve for potential future losses, we had derivative assets of $ 715 million and derivative liabilities of $ 194 million that were not designated as hedging instruments. These positions are primarily comprised of derivative contracts entered into for client accommodation purposes. 

Additional information regarding our accounting policies for derivatives is provided in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships 

Net interest income and the EVE change in response to changes in the mix of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments and the associated interest rates tied to each instrument. In addition, differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities cause net interest income and the EVE to fluctuate. We utilize derivatives that have been designated as part of a hedge relationship in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance to manage net interest income and EVE to within our stated risk tolerances. The primary derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are interest rate swaps. 

We designate certain &#8220;receive fixed/pay variable&#8221; interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. These contracts convert certain fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate obligations, thereby modifying our exposure to changes in interest rates. As a result, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts. 

Similarly, we designate certain &#8220;receive fixed/pay variable&#8221; interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These contracts effectively convert certain floating-rate loans into fixed-rate loans to reduce the potential adverse effect of interest rate decreases on future interest income. Again, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts. 

We designate interest rate floors as cash flow hedges. Interest rate floors also reduce the potential adverse effect of interest rate decreases on future interest income. We receive interest payments when the strike price specified in the contracts falls below a reference rate in exchange for an upfront premium. 

We designate certain &#8220;pay fixed/receive variable&#8221; interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These swaps convert certain floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. We also use these swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans and certain student loans originated through our Laurel Road digital lending business. The swaps protect against the possible short-term decline in the value of the loans that could result from changes in interest rates between the time they are originated and the time they are sold. 

We use foreign currency forward transactions to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in various foreign equipment finance entities. These entities are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. These swaps are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate the exposure of measuring the net investment at the spot foreign exchange rate. Our last remaining net investment hedge was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the liquidation of the net assets of KEF&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships 

We may enter into interest rate swap contracts to manage economic risks but do not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Excluding contracts addressing customer exposures, the amount of derivatives hedging risks on an economic basis at December 31, 2019 , was not significant. 

Like other financial services institutions, we originate loans and extend credit, both of which expose us to credit risk. We actively manage our overall loan portfolio and the associated credit risk in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. Purchasing credit protection through default swaps enables us to transfer to a third party a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit, including situations where there is a forecasted sale of loans. We purchase credit default swaps to reduce the credit risk associated with the debt securities held in our trading portfolio. 

We also enter into derivative contracts for other purposes, including:

##TABLE_END Fair Values, Volume of Activity, and Gain/Loss Information Related to Derivative Instruments 

The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . The change in the notional amounts of these derivatives by type from December 31, 2018 , to December 31, 2019 , indicates the volume of our derivative transaction activity during 2019 . The notional amounts are not affected by bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Where master netting agreements are not in effect or are not enforceable under bankruptcy laws, we do not adjust those derivative assets and liabilities with counterparties. Securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the balance sheet. Our derivative instruments are included in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; or &#8220;accrued expenses and other liabilities&#8221; on the balance sheet, as indicated in the following table:

Other collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The other collateral consists of securities and is exchanged under bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. The application of the other collateral cannot reduce the net derivative position below zero. Therefore, excess other collateral, if any, is not reflected above.

##TABLE_END Cash flow hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 

Considering the interest rates, yield curves, and notional amounts as of December 31, 2019 , we would expect to reclassify an estimated $ 132 million of after-tax net losses on derivative instruments from AOCI to income during the next 12 months for our cash flow hedges. In addition, we expect to reclassify approximately $ 3 million of pre-tax net losses related to terminated cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months . As of December 31, 2019 , the maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is 10 years . 

The following tables summarize the effect of fair value and cash flow hedge accounting on the income statement for the years ended December 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 , and December 31, 2017 .

Net investment hedges. We previously entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in the carrying value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries as a result of changes in the related foreign exchange rates. In December 2019, our last remaining net investment hedge was discontinued in connection with the substantial liquidation of the net assets of KEF&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary. The discontinuance of this hedge relationship resulted in reclassification from AOCI into other income of pre-tax gains of $ 32 million related to cumulative changes in the fair value of the net investment hedge. The gain was offset by the reclassification of $ 14 

million from AOCI into other income related to the pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustment loss on the net investment balance. 

We did not exclude any portion of our hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on our cash flow and net investment hedges for the years ended December 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 , and December 31, 2017 , and where they are recorded on the income statement. The table includes net gains (losses) recognized in OCI during the period and net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into income during the current period.

Counterparty Credit Risk 

We use several means to mitigate and manage exposure to credit risk on derivative contracts. We enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with a single counterparty in the event of default. Additionally, we monitor counterparty credit risk exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on our total credit exposure across all product types. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard ISDA documentation, central clearing rules, and other related agreements. We hold collateral in the form of cash and highly rated 

securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, or GNMA. Cash collateral netted against derivative assets on the balance sheet totaled $ 207 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 33 million at December 31, 2018 . The cash collateral netted against derivative liabilities totaled $ 69 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 37 million at December 31, 2018 . 

The following table summarizes the fair value of our derivative assets by type at the dates indicated. These assets represent our gross exposure to potential loss after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and other means used to mitigate risk.

We enter into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and clients. Since these groups have different economic characteristics, we have different methods for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk. 

We enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions are primarily high dollar volume. We enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties. We clear certain types of derivative transactions with these counterparties, whereby central clearing organizations become the counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts through swap execution facilities. Swap clearing and swap execution facilities reduce our exposure to counterparty credit risk. At December 31, 2019 , we had gross exposure of $ 431 million to broker-dealers and banks. We had net exposure of $ 107 million after the application of master netting agreements and cash collateral, where such qualifying agreements exist. We had net exposure of $ 105 million after considering $ 2 million of additional collateral held in the form of securities. 

We enter into transactions using master netting agreements with clients to accommodate their business needs. In most cases, we mitigate our credit exposure by cross-collateralizing these transactions to the underlying loan collateral. For transactions that are not clearable, we mitigate our market risk by buying and selling U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollar futures or entering into offsetting positions. Due to the cross-collateralization to the underlying loan, we typically do not exchange cash or marketable securities collateral in connection with these transactions. To address the risk of default associated with these contracts, we have established a CVA reserve (included in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221;) in the amount of $ 27 million at December 31, 2019 . The CVA is calculated from potential future exposures, expected recovery rates, and market-implied probabilities of default. At December 31, 2019 , we had gross exposure of $ 753 million to client counterparties and other entities that are not broker-dealers or banks for derivatives that have associated master netting agreements. We had net exposure of $ 672 million on our derivatives with these counterparties after the application of master netting agreements, collateral, and the related reserve. 

Credit Derivatives 

We are a buyer and, under limited circumstances, may be a seller of credit protection through the credit derivative market. We purchase credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending and swap obligations as well as exposures to debt securities. Our credit derivative portfolio was in a net liability position of $ 9 million as of December 31, 2019 and less than $ 1 million as of December 31, 2018 . 

Our credit derivative portfolio consists of the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Single-name credit default swap : A bilateral contract whereby the seller agrees, for a premium, to provide protection against the credit risk of a specific entity (the &#8220;reference entity&#8221;) in connection with a specific debt obligation. The protected credit risk is related to adverse credit events, such as bankruptcy, failure to make payments, and acceleration or restructuring of obligations, identified in the credit derivative contract. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Traded credit default swap index: Represents a position on a basket or portfolio of reference entities. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Risk participation agreement: A transaction in which the lead participant has a swap agreement with a customer. The lead participant (purchaser of protection) then enters into a risk participation agreement with a counterparty (seller of protection), under which the counterparty receives a fee to accept a portion of the lead participant&#8217;s credit risk. If the customer defaults on the swap contract, the counterparty to the risk participation agreement must reimburse the lead participant for the counterparty&#8217;s percentage of the positive fair value of the customer swap as of the default date. If the customer swap has a negative fair value, the counterparty has no reimbursement requirements. If the customer defaults on the swap contract and the seller fulfills its payment obligations under the risk participation agreement, the seller is entitled to a pro rata share of the lead participant&#8217;s claims against the customer under the terms of the swap agreement. 

##TABLE_END 

The following table provides information on the types of credit derivatives sold by us and held on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . The notional amount represents the amount that the seller could be required to pay. The payment/performance risk shown in the table represents a weighted average of the default probabilities for all reference entities in the respective portfolios. These default probabilities are implied from observed credit indices in the credit default swap market, which are mapped to reference entities based on Key&#8217;s internal risk rating.

Credit Risk Contingent Features 

We have entered into certain derivative contracts that require us to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings with Moody&#8217;s and S&#38;P. Collateral requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which are specific to each Credit Support Annex (a component of the ISDA Master Agreement) that we have signed with the counterparties. In a limited number of instances, counterparties have the right to terminate their ISDA Master Agreements with us if our ratings fall below a certain level, usually investment-grade level (i.e., &#8220;Baa3&#8221; for Moody&#8217;s and &#8220;BBB-&#8221; for S&#38;P). At December 31, 2019 , KeyBank&#8217;s rating was &#8220; A3 &#8221; with Moody&#8217;s and &#8220; A- &#8221; with S&#38;P, and KeyCorp&#8217;s rating was &#8220; Baa1 &#8221; with Moody&#8217;s and &#8220; BBB+ &#8221; with S&#38;P. As of December 31, 2019 , the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containing collateral posting or termination provisions based on our ratings) held by KeyBank that were in a net liability position totaled $ 62 million , which includes $ 25 million in derivative assets and $ 87 million in derivative liabilities. We had $ 60 million in cash and securities collateral posted to cover those positions as of December 31, 2019 . There were no derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features held by KeyCorp at December 31, 2019 . 

The following table summarizes the additional cash and securities collateral that KeyBank would have been required to deliver under the ISDA Master Agreements had the credit risk contingent features been triggered for the derivative contracts in a net liability position as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . The additional collateral amounts were calculated based on scenarios under which KeyBank&#8217;s ratings are downgraded one, two, or three ratings as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , and take into account all collateral already posted. A similar calculation was performed for KeyCorp, and no additional collateral would have been required at December 31, 2019 , or December 31, 2018 .

KeyBank&#8217;s long-term senior unsecured credit rating was four ratings above noninvestment grade at Moody&#8217;s and S&#38;P as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . If KeyBank&#8217;s ratings had been downgraded below investment grade as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , payments of up to $ 3 million and $ 4 million , respectively, would have been required to either terminate the contracts or post additional collateral for those contracts in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral already posted. If KeyCorp&#8217;s ratings had been downgraded below investment grade as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , no payments would have been required to either terminate the contracts or post additional collateral for those contracts in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral already posted. 

9. Mortgage Servicing Assets 

We originate and periodically sell commercial and residential mortgage loans but continue to service those loans for the buyers. We also may purchase the right to service commercial mortgage loans for other lenders. We record a servicing asset if we purchase or retain the right to service loans in exchange for servicing fees that exceed the going market servicing rate and are considered more than adequate compensation for servicing. Additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage and other servicing assets is included in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Servicing Assets.&#8221;

The fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the commercial mortgage loans. This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The range and weighted-average of the significant unobservable inputs used to fair value our commercial mortgage servicing assets at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table:

##TABLE_END

If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets may also change. Expected credit losses, escrow earn rates, and discount rates are critical to the valuation of commercial mortgage servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates and reflect historical data associated with the commercial mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. A decrease in the value assigned to the escrow earn rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. An increase in the assumed default rates of commercial mortgage loans or an increase in the assigned discount rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Prepayment activity on commercial serviced loans does not significantly impact the valuation of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions impacting the borrower&#8217;s ability to prepay the mortgage. 

The amortization of commercial mortgage servicing assets for each period, as shown in the table at the beginning of this note, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans totaled $ 196 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , $ 171 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and $ 150 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . This fee income was partially offset by $ 118 million of amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 , $ 102 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and $ 90 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in &#8220;mortgage servicing fees&#8221; on the income statement.

If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of residential mortgage servicing assets may also change. Prepayment speed, discount rates, and servicing cost are critical to the valuation of residential mortgage servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates and reflect historical data associated with the residential mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. An increase in the prepayment speed would cause a decrease in the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing assets. An increase in the assigned discount rates and servicing cost assumptions would cause a decrease in the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing assets. 

The amortization of residential mortgage servicing assets for December 31, 2019 , as shown in the table above, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing residential mortgage loans totaled $ 21 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , $ 14 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and $ 12 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . This fee income was offset by $ 6 million of amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 , $ 4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and $ 4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in &#8220;mortgage servicing fees&#8221; on the income statement. 

10. Leases 

As a lessee, we enter into leases of land, buildings, and equipment. Our real estate leases primarily relate to bank branches and office space. The leases of equipment principally relate to technology assets for data processing and data storage. As a lessor, we primarily provide financing through our equipment leasing business. 

Lessee 

Our leases are classified as either operating or financing and have remaining terms ranging from 1 to 20 years with the exception of certain ground leases that have terms over 30 years. For leases with initial terms greater than one year, a lease liability, measured as the present value of unpaid lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset for the right to use the leased properties are reported on the balance sheet. Lease payments are discounted using Key&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate, consistent with what Key would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a term similar to each lease. Leases with an initial term of less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet. The related expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Certain leases contain options to extend the lease term for up to five years . Some leases give us the option to terminate, for a penalty or at the lessor's discretion. Leases with variable payments are primarily based on adjustments for inflation over the term of the lease based on a contractually defined index. Certain ATM leases include variable payments based on volume of transactions. 

Operating lease expense is recognized in "net occupancy" and "equipment" on the income statement. The components of lease expense are summarized as follows:

Lessor Equipment Leasing 

Leases may have fixed or floating rate terms. Variable payments are based on an index or other specified rate and are included in rental payments. Certain leases contain an option to extend the lease term or the option to terminate at the discretion of the lessee. Under certain conditions, lease agreements may also contain the option for a lessee to purchase the underlying asset. 

Interest income from sales-type and direct financing leases is recognized in "interest income &#8212; loans" on the statement of income. Income related to operating leases is recognized in &#8220;operating lease income and other leasing gains&#8221; on the income statement.

The residual value component of a lease represents the fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. We rely on industry data, historical experience, independent appraisals and the experience of the equipment leasing asset management team to value lease residuals. Relationships with a number of equipment vendors give the asset management team insight into the life cycle of the leased equipment, pending product upgrades and competing products. Effective January 1, 2019, as a result of the implementation of ASU 2016-02, Key assesses net investments in leases, including residual values, for impairment and recognizes any impairment losses in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. The carrying amount of residual assets covered by residual value guarantees was $ 289 million at December 31, 2019 .

12. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Our annual goodwill impairment testing is performed as of October 1 each year, or more frequently as events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additional information pertaining to our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets is summarized in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#8221; 

We conducted a quantitative analysis as of October 1, 2019 , and concluded goodwill was not impaired. 

We determined that the estimated fair value of each of Key&#8217;s reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. The estimated fair value of the Consumer Bank reporting unit was 76 % greater than its carrying amount, the 

estimated fair value of the Commercial Bank reporting unit was 29 % greater than its carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the Institutional Bank reporting unit, which is aggregated in the Commercial Bank reporting segment, was 34 % greater than its carrying amount. The fair values of each reporting unit were estimated using a combination of income and market approaches. The income approach utilized discounted cash flow projections for each reporting unit. The market approach consisted primarily of public company metrics but also considered recent transactions in the financial services industry. The carrying amounts of Key&#8217;s reporting units represent the average equity based on risk-weighted regulatory capital for goodwill impairment testing and management reporting purposes. 

Based on our quarterly review of impairment indicators during 2019 and 2018 , it was not necessary to perform further reviews of goodwill recorded in our reporting units. We will continue to monitor as appropriate. 

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting segment are presented in the following table:

13. Variable Interest Entities 

A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The entity&#8217;s investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The entity&#8217;s equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entity&#8217;s activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights. 

##TABLE_END 

Our significant VIEs are summarized below. We define a &#8220;significant interest&#8221; in a VIE as a subordinated interest that exposes us to a significant portion, but not the majority, of the VIE&#8217;s expected losses or residual returns, even though we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance. 

LIHTC investments. Through KCDC, we have made investments directly and indirectly in LIHTC operating partnerships formed by third parties. As a limited partner in these operating partnerships, we are allocated tax credits and deductions associated with the underlying properties. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments because the general partners have the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of their respective partnerships and have the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive residual returns. As we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate them. 

Our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these partnerships consists of our unamortized investment balance plus any unfunded equity commitments and tax credits claimed but subject to recapture. We had $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.4 billion of investments in LIHTC operating partnerships at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , respectively. These investments are recorded in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; on our balance sheet. We do not have any loss reserves recorded related to these investments because we believe the likelihood of any loss is remote. For all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , we had liabilities of $ 546 million and $ 532 million , respectively, related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which are recorded in &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities&#8221; on our balance sheet. We continue to invest in these LIHTC operating partnerships. 

The assets and liabilities presented in the table below convey the size of KCDC&#8217;s direct and indirect investments at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . As these investments represent unconsolidated VIEs, the assets and liabilities of the investments themselves are not recorded on our balance sheet.

##TABLE_END

We amortize our LIHTC investments over the period that we expect to receive the tax benefits. In 2019 , we recognized $ 187 million of amortization and $ 184 million of tax credits associated with these investments within &#8220;income taxes&#8221; on our income statement. In 2018 , we recognized $ 170 million of amortization and $ 166 million of tax credits associated with these investments within &#8220;income taxes&#8221; on our income statement. 

Principal investments. Through our principal investing entity, KCC, we have made investments in private equity funds engaged in venture- and growth-oriented investing. As a limited partner to these funds, KCC records these investments at fair value and receives distributions from the funds in accordance with the funds&#8217; partnership agreements. We are not the primary beneficiary of these investments as we do not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds&#8217; economic performance. Such power rests with the funds&#8217; general partners. In addition, we neither have the obligation to absorb the funds&#8217; expected losses nor the right to receive their residual returns. Our voting rights are also disproportionate to our economic interests, and substantially all of the funds&#8217; activities are conducted on behalf of investors with disproportionately few voting rights. Because we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate them. 

Our maximum exposure to loss associated with indirect principal investments consists of the investments&#8217; fair value plus any unfunded equity commitments. The fair value of our indirect principal investments totaled $ 68 million and 

$ 96 million at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , respectively. These investments are recorded in &#8220;other investments&#8221; on our balance sheet. Additional information on indirect principal investments is provided in Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;). The table below reflects the size of the private equity funds in which KCC was invested as well as our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these investments at December 31, 2019 .

##TABLE_END

Through our principal investing entities, we have formed and funded operating entities that provide management and other related services to our investment company funds, which directly invest in portfolio companies. In return for providing services to our direct investment funds, these entities&#8217; receive a minority equity interest in the funds. This minority equity ownership is recorded at fair value on the entities&#8217; financial statements. Additional information on our direct principal investments is provided in Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;). While other equity investors manage the daily operations of these entities, we retain the power, through voting rights, to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact their economic performance. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant to these entities. As a result, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these funds and have consolidated them since formation. The entities had no assets and no liabilities at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . 

Other unconsolidated VIEs. We are involved with other various entities in the normal course of business which we have determined to be VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our assets associated with these unconsolidated VIEs totaled $ 282 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 248 million at December 31, 2018 . These assets are recorded in &#8220;accrued income and other assets,&#8221; &#8220;other investments,&#8221; &#8220;securities available for sale,&#8221; and &#8220;loans, net of unearned income&#8221; on our balance sheet. We had liabilities totaling $ 1 million associated with these unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2019 , and $ 2 million at December 31, 2018 . These liabilities are recorded in &#8220;accrued expenses and other liabilities&#8221; on our balance sheet. We have excluded certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs from the balances above where we determine our continuing involvement is not significant. In addition, where we only have a lending arrangement in the normal course of business with unconsolidated VIEs we present the balances related to the lending arrangements in Note 5 (&#8220; Asset Quality &#8221;).

##TABLE_START (a) 

There was income tax (benefit) expense on securities transactions of $ 5 million in 2019 , and no income tax (benefit) expense on securities transactions in 2018 and 2017 . Income tax expense excludes equity- and gross receipts-based taxes, which are assessed in lieu of an income tax in certain states in which we operate. These non-income taxes, which are recorded in &#8220;noninterest expense&#8221; on the income statement, totaled $ 23 million in 2019 , $ 15 million in 2018 , and $ 22 million in 2017 . 

##TABLE_END 

On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was signed into law. This comprehensive tax legislation provided for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that impacted corporate taxation requirements such as the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 . 

We were required to re-value certain tax-related assets under the provisions of the TCJ Act at December 31, 2017. Under current U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect included in income from continuing operations in the reporting period that includes the enactment date. The tax-related assets consist primarily of deferred tax assets and liabilities and investments in low-income housing transactions. We recorded a $ 147 million , or 7.6 % , increase in our income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, due to the reduction to our net deferred tax asset and related actions. 

During 2018, we completed and filed our 2017 federal income tax return and management finalized its assessment of the initial impact of the TCJ Act and related regulatory guidance. As a result, our income tax provision was increased by $ 7 million . 

Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities included in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; and &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities,&#8221; respectively, on the balance sheet, are as follows:

We conduct quarterly assessments of all available evidence to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. The available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo significant change. Based on these criteria, we have no recorded valuation allowances at December 31, 2019 . 

At December 31, 2019 , we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 43 million and federal credit carryforwards of $ 72 million . The federal net operating loss carryforwards are from prior acquisitions by First Niagara and are subject to annual limitations under the tax code and, if not utilized, will expire in the years beginning 2027. The federal credit carryforward consists of general business credits which expire in 2037, under the Internal Revenue Code. We currently expect to fully utilize these losses and credits. 

We had state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 40 million , resulting in a net state deferred tax asset of $ 1 million .

##TABLE_END

Each quarter, we review the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. Any adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in income tax expense. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate was $ 19 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 35 million at December 31, 2018 . We do not currently anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change over the next 12 months . 

As permitted under the applicable accounting guidance, it is our policy to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recorded net interest benefit of $ .9 million , $ .7 million , and $ 1.3 million in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. We did no t recover any state tax penalties in 2019 or 2018 . We recovered state tax penalties of $ 1 million in 2017. At December 31, 2019 , we had an accrued interest payable of $ 2 million , compared to $ 3 million at December 31, 2018 . There was no liability for accrued state tax penalties at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . 

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , are $ 15.9 million and $ 14.3 million , respectively. 

We file federal income tax returns, as well as returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax examination by the IRS for the tax years 2013 and forward. Currently, we are under IRS audit for the tax years 2013 and 2014. We are not subject to income tax examinations by other tax authorities for years prior to 2009. 

Pre-1988 Bank Reserves acquired in a business combination 

Retained earnings of KeyBank included approximately $ 92 million of allocated bad debt deductions for which no income taxes have been recorded. Under current federal law, these reserves are subject to recapture into taxable income if KeyBank, or any successor, fails to maintain its bank status under the Internal Revenue Code or makes non-dividend distributions or distributions greater than its accumulated earnings and profits. No deferred tax liability has been established as these events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future. 

15. Acquisitions, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations 

Acquisitions 

Laurel Road Digital Lending Business. On April 3, 2019, KeyBank acquired Laurel Road's digital lending business from Laurel Road Bank. Laurel Road Bank's three bank branches located in southeast Connecticut were not part of this transaction. Through the acquisition, KeyBank expects to enhance its digital capabilities with state-of-the-art, customer-centric technology and to leverage Laurel Road's proven ability to attract and serve professional millennial clients. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination. During the second quarter of 2019, we recognized provisional identifiable intangible assets with an estimated fair value of $ 37 million . We also recognized provisional goodwill of $ 148 million in connection with this acquisition. These fair value estimates represent our best estimate of fair value and are expected to be finalized over a period of up to one year from the acquisition date. 

Divestitures 

Key Insurance &#38; Benefits Services, Inc. On May 4, 2018, we completed the sale of KIBS to USI Insurance Services. We acquired KIBS as a part of the 2016 merger with First Niagara. At the close of the sale to USI Insurance Services, we recognized a $ 73 million net gain on sale. In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an additional $ 5 million gain upon the finalization of the net working capital. 

Discontinued operations 

Discontinued operations includes our government-guaranteed and private education lending business. At December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , approximately $ 865 million and $ 1.1 billion , respectively, of education loans are included in discontinued assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Net interest income after provision for credit losses for this business is not material and is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes on the consolidated statements of income.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

Netting adjustments take into account the impact of master netting agreements that allow us to settle with a single counterparty on a net basis. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

These adjustments take into account the impact of bilateral collateral agreements that allow us to offset the net positions with the related collateral. The application of collateral cannot reduce the net position below zero. Therefore, excess collateral, if any, is not reflected above. 

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (c) 

Repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgaged-backed agency securities and are contracted on an overnight or continuous basis. 

##TABLE_END 

As of December 31, 2019 , the carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled $ 204 million . Assets pledged as collateral are reported in &#8220;available for sale&#8221; and &#8220;held-to-maturity&#8221; securities on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2019 , the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of customer sweep financing activity and had a carrying value of $ 180 million . The collateral pledged under customer sweep repurchase agreements is posted to a third-party custodian and cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. The risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged is minimal given the collateral's high credit quality and the overnight duration of the repurchase agreements. 

Like other financing transactions, securities financing agreements contain an element of credit risk. To mitigate and manage credit risk exposure, we generally enter into master netting agreements and other collateral arrangements that give us the right, in the event of default, to liquidate collateral held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. Additionally, we establish and monitor limits on our counterparty credit risk exposure by product type. For the reverse repurchase agreements, we monitor the value of the underlying securities we received from counterparties and either request additional collateral or return a portion of the collateral based on the value of those securities. We generally hold collateral in the form of highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and fixed income securities. In addition, we may need to provide collateral to counterparties under our repurchase agreements. With the exception of collateral pledged against customer sweep repurchase agreements, the collateral we pledge and receive can generally be sold or repledged by the secured parties. 

17. Stock-Based Compensation 

We maintain several stock-based compensation plans, which are described below. Total compensation expense for these plans was $ 96 million for 2019 , $ 99 million for 2018 , and $ 104 million for 2017 . The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for these plans was $ 23 million for 2019 , $ 23 million for 2018 , and $ 39 million for 2017 . 

Our compensation plans allow us to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, or other awards which may be denominated or payable in or valued by reference to our Common Shares or other factors, discounted stock purchases, and deferred compensation to eligible employees and directors. At December 31, 2019 , we had 59,991,178 Common Shares available for future grant under our compensation plans. In accordance with a resolution adopted by the Compensation and Organization Committee of KeyCorp&#8217;s Board of Directors, we may not grant options to purchase Common Shares, restricted stock or other shares under any long-term compensation plan in an aggregate amount that exceeds 6 % of our outstanding Common Shares in any rolling three -year period. 

Stock Options 

Stock options granted to employees generally become exercisable at the rate of 25 % per year. No option granted by KeyCorp will be exercisable less than one year after, or expire later than ten years from, the grant date. The exercise price is the closing price of our Common Shares on the grant date (or the prior business day if the grant date is not a business day). 

We determine the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model was originally developed to determine the fair value of exchange-traded equity options, which (unlike employee stock options) have no vesting period or transferability restrictions. Because of these differences, the Black-Scholes model does not precisely value an employee stock option, but it is commonly used for this purpose. The model assumes that the estimated fair value of an option is amortized as compensation expense over the option&#8217;s vesting period. 

The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions, which we developed and update based on historical trends and current market observations. Our determination of the fair value of options is only as accurate as the underlying assumptions. The assumptions pertaining to options issued during 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 are shown in the following table.

In 2019, shareholders approved the 2019 Equity Compensation Plan, under which 71,600,000 shares may be issued as equity awards. The Compensation and Organization Committee has authority to approve all stock option grants but may delegate some of its authority to grant awards from time to time. The committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant equity awards, including stock options, to any employee who is not designated an &#8220;officer&#8221; for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. No more than 3,000,000 Common Shares may be issued under this authority.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. 

##TABLE_END The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options was $ 3.07 for options granted during 2019 , $ 5.12 for options granted during 2018 , and $ 4.60 for options granted during 2017 . Stock option exercises numbered 2,039,208 in 2019 , 1,960,444 in 2018 , and 3,755,177 in 2017 . The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $ 18 million for 2019 , $ 21 million for 2018 , and $ 31 million for 2017 . As of December 31, 2019 , unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options under the plans totaled $ 2 million . We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years . 

Cash received from options exercised was $ 18 million , $ 20 million , and $ 25 million in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised totaled $ 1 million for 2019 , $ 1 million for 2018 , and $ 4 million for 2017 . 

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Program

##TABLE_END

The compensation cost of time-lapsed and performance-based restricted stock or unit awards granted under the Program is calculated using the closing trading price of our Common Shares on the grant date (or the prior business day if the grant date is not a business day). 

Unlike time-lapsed and performance-based restricted stock or units, we do not pay dividends during the vesting period for performance shares or units that may become payable in excess of targeted performance. 

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of awards granted under the Program was $ 18.25 during 2019 , $ 19.28 during 2018 , and $ 19.82 during 2017 . As of December 31, 2019 , unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares under the Program totaled $ 87 million . We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years . The total fair value of shares vested was $ 89 million in 2019 , $ 93 million in 2018 , and $ 76 million in 2017 . 

Deferred Compensation and Other Restricted Stock Awards 

Our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and mandatory deferral programs for Common Shares awarded to certain employees and directors. Mandatory deferred incentive awards vest at the rate of 25 % per year beginning one year after the deferral date. Deferrals under the voluntary programs are immediately vested. 

We also may grant, upon approval by the Compensation and Organization Committee (or our Chief Executive Officer with respect to their delegated authority), other time-lapsed restricted stock or unit awards under various programs to recognize outstanding performance. 

The following table summarizes activity and pricing information for the nonvested shares granted under our deferred compensation plans and these other restricted stock or unit award programs for the year ended December 31, 2019 .

As of December 31, 2019 , unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under our deferred compensation plans and the other restricted stock or unit award programs totaled $ 17 million . We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years . The total fair value of shares vested was $ 19 million in 2019 , $ 22 million in 2018 , and $ 21 million in 2017 . Dividend equivalents presented in the preceding table represent the value of dividends accumulated during the vesting period. 

Discounted Stock Purchase Plan 

Our Discounted Stock Purchase Plan provides employees the opportunity to purchase our Common Shares at a 10 % discount through payroll deductions or cash payments. Purchases are limited to $ 10,000 in any month and $ 50,000 in any calendar year, and are immediately vested. To accommodate employee purchases, we issue treasury shares on or around the fifteenth day of the month following the month employee payments are received. We issued 327,243 Common Shares at a weighted-average cost to employees of $ 15.73 during 2019 , 327,435 Common Shares at a weighted-average cost to employees of $ 17.48 during 2018 , and 257,738 Common Shares at a weighted-average cost to employees of $ 16.61 during 2017 . 

Information pertaining to our method of accounting for stock-based compensation is included in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation.&#8221; 

18. Employee Benefits 

Pension Plans 

Effective December 31, 2009, we amended our cash balance pension plan and other defined benefit plans to freeze all benefit accruals and close the plans to new employees. We will continue to credit participants&#8217; existing account balances for interest until they receive their plan benefits. We changed certain pension plan assumptions after freezing the plans. As part of the acquisition of First Niagara, Key also obtained two frozen defined benefit plans sponsored by First Niagara, both of which provide benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels. Effective September 30, 2016, the two First Niagara plans merged into another defined benefit plan maintained by Key to form the KeyCorp Consolidated Cash Balance Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, our original cash balance pension plan merged into the KeyCorp Consolidated Cash Balance Plan. 

Pre-tax AOCI not yet recognized as net pension cost was $ 471 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 511 million at December 31, 2018 , consisting entirely of net unrecognized losses. 

During 2019 and 2018 , lump sum payments made under certain pension plans triggered settlement accounting. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit plans, we performed a remeasurement of the affected plans in conjunction with the settlement and recognized the settlement loss as reflected in the following table. 

The components of net pension cost and the amount recognized in OCI for all funded and unfunded plans are as follows:

##TABLE_END At December 31, 2019 , our primary qualified cash balance pension plan was sufficiently funded under the requirements of ERISA. Consequently, we are not required to make a minimum contribution to that plan in 2020 . We also do not expect to make any significant discretionary contributions during 2020 . 

At December 31, 2019 , we expect to pay the benefits from all funded and unfunded pension plans as follows: 2020 &#8212; $ 94 million ; 2021 &#8212; $ 93 million ; 2022 &#8212; $ 91 million ; 2023 &#8212; $ 90 million ; 2024 &#8212; $ 88 million and $ 394 million in the aggregate from 2025 through 2029. 

The ABO for all of our pension plans was $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 , and $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2018 . As indicated in the table below, collectively our plans had an ABO in excess of plan assets as follows: &#160;

##TABLE_END

We estimate that we will recognize $ 13 million in net pension cost for 2020, compared to net pension cost of $ 29 million in 2019 and $ 22 million for 2018. A settlement loss was recorded in both 2019 and 2018 but not in 2017. 

We estimate that a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would change our net pension cost for 2020 by approximately $ 3 million . Pension cost also is affected by an assumed discount rate. We estimate that a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would change net pension cost for 2020 by approximately $ 2 million . 

The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering a number of factors, the most significant of which are: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Our expectations for returns on plan assets over the long term, weighted for the investment mix of the assets. These expectations consider, among other factors, historical capital market returns of equity, fixed income, convertible, and other securities, and forecasted returns that are modeled under various economic scenarios. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Historical returns on our plan assets. Based on an annual reassessment of current and expected future capital market returns, our expected return on plan assets was 4.5 % for 2019 , 4.75 % for 2018 and 6 % for 2017 . We deemed a rate of 3.75 % to be appropriate in estimating 2019 pension cost. 

##TABLE_END The investment objectives of the pension fund are developed to reflect the characteristics of the plan, such as pension formulas, cash lump sum distribution features, and the liability profiles of the plan&#8217;s participants. An executive oversight committee reviews the plan&#8217;s investment performance at least quarterly, and compares performance against appropriate market indices. The pension fund&#8217;s investment objectives are to balance total return objectives with a continued management of plan liabilities, and to minimize the mismatch between assets and liabilities. These objectives are being implemented through liability driven investing and the adoption of a de-risking glide path. The following table shows the asset target allocations prescribed by the pension fund&#8217;s investment policies based on the plan&#8217;s funded status at December 31, 2019 .

Equity securities include common stocks of domestic and foreign companies, as well as foreign company stocks traded as American Depositary Shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Debt securities include investments in domestic- and foreign-issued corporate bonds, U.S. government and agency bonds, international government bonds, and mutual funds. Real assets include an investment in a diversified real asset strategy separate account designed to provide exposure to the three core real assets: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, commodities, and real estate. Other assets include investments in a multi-strategy investment fund and a limited partnership. 

Although the pension funds&#8217; investment policies conditionally permit the use of derivative contracts, we have not entered into any such contracts, and we do not expect to employ such contracts in the future. 

The valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets vary depending on the type of asset, as described below. For an explanation of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Fair Value Measurements.&#8221; 

Equity securities. Equity securities traded on securities exchanges are valued at the closing price on the exchange or system where the security is principally traded. These securities are classified as Level 1 since quoted prices for identical securities in active markets are available. 

Debt securities. Substantially all debt securities are investment grade and include domestic- and foreign-issued corporate bonds and U.S. government and agency bonds. These securities are valued using evaluated prices based on observable inputs, such as dealer quotes, available trade information, spreads, bids and offers, prepayment speeds, U.S. Treasury curves, and interest rate movements. Debt securities are classified as Level 2. 

Mutual funds. Exchange-traded mutual funds listed or traded on securities exchanges are valued at the closing price on the exchange or system where the security is principally traded. These securities are classified as Level 1 because quoted prices for identical securities in active markets are available. 

Collective investment funds. Investments in collective investment funds are valued using the net asset value practical expedient and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Fair value is determined based on Key&#8217;s proportionate share of total net assets in the fund. 

Insurance investment contracts and pooled separate accounts. Deposits under insurance investment contracts and pooled separate accounts with insurance companies do not have readily determinable fair values and are valued using a methodology that is consistent with accounting guidance that allows the plan to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership in partners&#8217; capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed); thus, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. 

Other assets. Other assets include an investment in a multi-strategy investment fund and an investment in a limited partnership. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are valued using a methodology consistent with accounting guidance that allows the plan to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership in partners&#8217; capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed); thus, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. 

The following tables show the fair values of our pension plan assets by asset class at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 .

##TABLE_END Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 

We sponsor a retiree healthcare plan in which all employees age 55 with five years of service (or employees age 50 with 15 years of service who are terminated under conditions that entitle them to a severance benefit) are eligible to participate. Participant contributions are adjusted annually. Key may provide a subsidy toward the cost of coverage 

for certain employees hired before 2001 with a minimum of 15 years of service at the time of termination. We use a separate VEBA trust to fund the retiree healthcare plan. Effective November 29, 2016, an unfunded retiree welfare plan previously sponsored by First Niagara merged into our current retiree healthcare plan.

There are no regulations that require contributions to the VEBA trust that funds our retiree healthcare plan, so there is no minimum funding requirement. We are permitted to make discretionary contributions to the VEBA trust, subject to certain IRS restrictions and limitations. We anticipate that our discretionary contributions in 2020 , if any, will be minimal. 

At December 31, 2019 , we expect to pay the benefits from other postretirement plans as follows: 2020 &#8212; $ 7 million ; 2021 &#8212; $ 7 million ; 2022 &#8212; $ 6 million ; 2023 &#8212; $ 5 million ; 2024 &#8212; $ 5 million ; and $ 24 million in the aggregate from 2024 through 2028. 

To determine the APBO, we assumed discount rates of 4.5 % at December 31, 2019 , and 4 % at December 31, 2018 . 

To determine net postretirement benefit cost, we assumed the following weighted-average rates.

##TABLE_END

The realized net investment income for the postretirement healthcare plan VEBA trust is subject to federal income taxes, which are reflected in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets shown above. 

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates do not have a material impact on net postretirement benefit cost or obligations since the postretirement plan has cost-sharing provisions and benefit limitations. 

We do no t expect to recognize a credit or an expense in net postretirement benefit cost for 2020 . We recognized a credit of less than $ 1 million in 2019 and 2018 . 

We estimate the expected returns on plan assets for the VEBA trust much the same way we estimate returns on our pension funds. The primary investment objectives of the VEBA trust are to obtain a market rate of return, take into consideration the safety and/or risk of the investment, and to diversify the portfolio in order to satisfy the trust&#8217;s anticipated liquidity requirements. The following table shows the asset target allocations prescribed by the trust&#8217;s investment policy.

##TABLE_END 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and prescribes a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that offer prescription drug coverage that is &#8220;actuarially equivalent&#8221; to the benefits under Medicare Part D. Based on our application of the relevant regulatory formula, we determined that the prescription drug coverage related to our retiree healthcare benefit plan is not actuarially equivalent to the Medicare benefit for the vast majority of retirees. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , we did not receive federal subsidies. 

Employee 401(k) Savings Plan 

A substantial number of our employees are covered under a savings plan that is qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan permits employees to contribute from 1 % to 100 % of eligible compensation, with up to 6 % being eligible for matching contributions. Commencing January 1, 2010, an automatic enrollment feature was added to the plan for all new employees. The initial default contribution percentage for employees is 2 % and will increase by 1 % at the beginning of each plan year until the default contribution is 10 % for plan years on and after January 1, 2012. The plan also permits us to provide a discretionary annual profit sharing contribution to eligible employees who have at least one year of service. First Niagara employees who joined Key retained their years of services, and those employees that met eligibility requirements under Key&#8217;s savings plan have been included. We accrued a 1 % contribution for 2019 and made contributions of 2 % and 2 % for 2018 and 2017 , respectively, on eligible compensation for employees eligible on the last business day of the respective plan years. In addition to the discretionary annual profit sharing contribution, in 2017 we accrued a one-time $ 1,000 contribution per eligible full-time employee and $ 500 per eligible part-time employee within the 401(k) savings plan. Employees eligible for the additional contribution must have been employed as of December 31, 2017 and have a salary of $ 100,000 or less. We also maintain a deferred savings plan that provides certain employees with benefits they otherwise would not have been eligible to receive under the qualified plan once their compensation for the plan year reached the IRS contribution limits. Total expense associated with the above plans was $ 98 million in 2019 , $ 106 million in 2018 , and $ 129 million in 2017 .

Rates exclude the effects of interest rate swaps and caps, which modify the repricing characteristics of certain short-term borrowings. For more information about such financial instruments, see Note 8 (&#8220; Derivatives and Hedging Activities &#8221;). 

##TABLE_END As described below and in Note 20 (&#8220; Long-Term Debt &#8221;), KeyCorp and KeyBank have a number of programs and facilities that support our short-term financing needs. Certain subsidiaries maintain credit facilities with third parties, which provide alternative sources of funding. KeyCorp is the guarantor of some of the third-party facilities. 

Short-term credit facilities. We maintain cash on deposit in our Federal Reserve account, which has reduced our need to obtain funds through various short-term unsecured money market products. This account, which was maintained at $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 , and the unpledged securities in our investment portfolio provide a buffer to address unexpected short-term liquidity needs. We also have secured borrowing facilities at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to satisfy short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2019 , our unused secured borrowing capacity was $ 25.2 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $ 8.1 billion at the FHLB. 

20. Long-Term Debt 

The following table presents the components of our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts and adjustments related to hedging with derivative financial instruments. We use interest rate swaps and caps, which modify the repricing characteristics of certain long-term debt, to manage interest rate risk. For more information about such financial instruments, see Note 8 (&#8220; Derivatives and Hedging Activities &#8221;). &#160;

As described below, KeyBank and KeyCorp have a number of programs that support our long-term financing needs. 

Global bank note program. On September 29, 2015, KeyBank updated its Global Bank Note Program, authorizing the issuance of up to $ 20 billion of notes domestically and abroad. Under the program, KeyBank is authorized to issue notes with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes. Notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies. Amounts outstanding under the program and any prior bank note programs are classified as &#8220;long-term debt&#8221; on the balance sheet. 

In 2018, KeyBank issued the following notes under the 2015 Global Bank Note Program: on March 7, 2018, $ 500 million of 3.375 % Senior Bank Notes due March 7, 2023; and on June 13, 2018, $ 500 million of 3.35 % Senior Bank Notes due June 15, 2021. 

On September 28, 2018, KeyBank again updated its Bank Note Program authorizing the issuance of up to $ 20 billion of notes. Under the program, KeyBank is authorized to issue notes with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes. Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars. Amounts outstanding under the program and any prior bank note programs are classified as &#8220;long-term debt&#8221; on the balance sheet. 

In 2019, KeyBank issued the following notes under the 2018 Bank Note Program: on February 1, 2019, $ 600 million of 3.300 % Senior Bank Notes due February 1, 2022, and $ 400 million of Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes due February 1, 2022; and on March 13, 2019, $ 350 million of 3.900 % Subordinated Bank Notes due April 13, 2029. 

As of December 31, 2019 , $ 1.4 billion of notes had been issued under the 2018 Bank Note Program, and $ 18.7 billion remained available for issuance. 

KeyCorp shelf registration, including Medium-Term Note Program . KeyCorp has a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under rules that allow companies to register various types of debt and equity securities without limitations on the aggregate amounts available for issuance. KeyCorp also maintains a Medium-Term Note Program that permits KeyCorp to issue notes with original maturities of nine months or more. 

In 2018, KeyCorp issued the following notes under the program: on April 30, 2018, $ 750 million of 4.10 % Senior Notes due April 30, 2028; and on October 29, 2018, $ 500 million of 4.150 % Senior Notes due October 29, 2025. 

In 2019, KeyCorp issued the following notes under the program: On September 11, 2019, $ 750 million of 2.550 % Senior Notes due October 1, 2029. 

At December 31, 2019 , KeyCorp had authorized and available for issuance up to $ 2.0 billion of additional debt securities under the Medium-Term Note Program. On February 6, 2020, KeyCorp issued $ 800 million of 2.250 % Senior Notes due April 6, 2027, under the Medium-Term Note Program. 

Issuances of capital securities or preferred stock by KeyCorp must be approved by the Board and cannot be objected to by the Federal Reserve. 

21. Trust Preferred Securities Issued by Unconsolidated Subsidiaries 

We own the outstanding common stock of business trusts formed by us that issued corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their trust preferred securities and common stock to buy debentures issued by KeyCorp. These debentures are the trusts&#8217; only assets; the interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. The outstanding common stock of these business trusts is recorded in &#8220;other investments&#8221; on our balance sheet. 

We unconditionally guarantee the following payments or distributions on behalf of the trusts:

The trust preferred securities must be redeemed when the related debentures mature, or earlier if provided in the governing indenture. Each issue of trust preferred securities carries an interest rate identical to that of the related debenture. Certain trust preferred securities include debt issuance costs and basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $ 57 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 46 million at December 31, 2018 . See Note 8 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) for an explanation of fair value hedges.

We have the right to redeem these debentures. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital I, HNC Statutory Trust III, Willow Grove Statutory Trust I, HNC Statutory Trust IV, Westbank Capital Trust II, or Westbank Capital Trust III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the greater of: (i) the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of principal and interest payments discounted at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the applicable indenture), plus 20 basis points for KeyCorp Capital II or 25 basis points for KeyCorp Capital III or 50 basis points in the case of redemption upon either a tax or a capital treatment event for either KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. The principal amount of certain debentures includes debt issuance costs and basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $ 57 million at December 31, 2019 , and $ 46 million at December 31, 2018 . See Note 8 for an explanation of fair value hedges. The principal amount of debentures, net of discounts, is included in &#8220;long-term debt&#8221; on the balance sheet.

22. Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees 

Commitments to Extend Credit or Funding 

Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These agreements generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses. We typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan, our aggregate outstanding commitments may significantly exceed our eventual cash outlay. 

Loan commitments involve credit risk not reflected on our balance sheet. We mitigate exposure to credit risk with internal controls that guide how we review and approve applications for credit, establish credit limits and, when necessary, demand collateral. In particular, we evaluate the creditworthiness of each prospective borrower on a case-by-case basis and, when appropriate, adjust the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. Additional information pertaining to this allowance is included in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Liability for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments,&#8221; and in Note 5 (&#8220; Asset Quality &#8221;). 

We also provide financial support to private equity investments, including existing direct portfolio companies and indirect private equity funds, to satisfy unfunded commitments. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on our balance sheet. Additional information on principal investing commitments is provided in Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;). Other unfunded equity investment commitments at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , related to tax credit investments and were primarily attributable to LIHTC investments. Unfunded tax credit investment commitments are recorded on our balance sheet in &#8220;other liabilities.&#8221; Additional information on LIHTC commitments is provided in Note 13 (&#8220; Variable Interest Entities &#8221;). 

The following table shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment related to extending credit or funding principal investments as of December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . For loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan.

Legal Proceedings 

Litigation. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various litigation, investigations, and administrative proceedings. Private, civil litigations may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members. Investigations may involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These matters may involve claims for substantial monetary relief. At times, these matters may present novel claims or legal theories. Due to the complex nature of these various other matters, it may be years before some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability, based on information presently known to us, we do not believe there is any matter to which we are a party, or involving any of our properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We continually monitor and reassess the potential materiality of these litigation matters. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. 

Guarantees 

We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. The following table shows the types of guarantees that we had outstanding at December 31, 2019 . Information pertaining to the basis for determining the liabilities recorded in connection with these guarantees is included in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Contingencies and Guarantees.&#8221;

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (a) 

The maximum potential undiscounted future payments represent notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees. 

##TABLE_END 

We determine the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee described below based on the probability that we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted future payments shown in the preceding table. We use a scale of low ( 0 % to 30 % probability of payment), moderate (greater than 30 % to 70 % probability of payment), or high (greater than 70 % probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk, and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee outstanding at December 31, 2019 , is low. 

Standby letters of credit. KeyBank issues standby letters of credit to address clients&#8217; financing needs. These instruments obligate us to pay a specified third party when a client fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument or fails to perform some contractual nonfinancial obligation. Any amounts drawn under standby letters of credit are treated as loans to the client; they bear interest (generally at variable rates) and pose the same credit risk 

to us as a loan. At December 31, 2019 , our standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average life of 2 years , with remaining actual lives ranging from less than 1 year to as many as 15 years . 

Recourse agreement with FNMA. We participate as a lender in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing program. FNMA delegates responsibility for originating, underwriting, and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that we sell to FNMA. We maintain a reserve for such potential losses in an amount that we believe approximates the fair value of our liability. At December 31, 2019 , the outstanding commercial mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of 7.7 years , and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us as a participant was $ 16.5 billion . The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30 % of the principal balance of loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 . If we are required to make a payment, we would have an interest in the collateral underlying the related commercial mortgage loan; any loss we incur could be offset by the amount of any recovery from the collateral. 

Residential Mortgage Banking. We often originate and sell residential mortgage loans and retain the servicing rights. Our loan sales activity is generally conducted through loan sales in a secondary market sponsored by FNMA and FHLMC and through the issuance of GNMA mortgage backed securities. Subsequent to the sale of mortgage loans, we do not typically retain any interest in the underlying loans except through our relationship as the servicer of the loans. 

As is customary in the mortgage banking industry, we, or banks we have acquired, have made certain representations and warranties related to the sale of residential mortgage loans (including loans sold with servicing rights released) and to the performance of our obligations as servicer. The breach of any such representations or warranties could result in losses for us. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the sold loans; however, any loss would be reduced by any payments received on the loans or through the sale of collateral. 

At December 31, 2019 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us was $ 6.1 billion . The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30 % of the principal balance of loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 . 

Our liability for estimated repurchase obligations on loans sold, which is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet, was $ 7 million at December 31, 2019 . 

Written put options. In the ordinary course of business, we &#8220;write&#8221; put options for clients that wish to mitigate their exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. At December 31, 2019 , our written put options had an average life of three years . These instruments are considered to be guarantees, as we are required to make payments to the counterparty (the client) based on changes in an underlying variable that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security that the client holds. We are obligated to pay the client if the applicable benchmark interest rate or commodity price is above or below a specified level (known as the &#8220;strike rate&#8221;). These written put options are accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed in Note 8 (&#8220; Derivatives and Hedging Activities &#8221;). We mitigate our potential future payment obligations by entering into offsetting positions with third parties. 

Written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do not hold the underlying instruments. In addition, we are a purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further discussed in Note 8 . 

Default guarantees. Some lines of business participate in guarantees that obligate us to perform if the debtor (typically a client) fails to satisfy all of its payment obligations to third parties. We generally undertake these guarantees for one of two possible reasons: (i) either the risk profile of the debtor should provide an investment return, or (ii) we are supporting our underlying investment in the debtor. We do not hold collateral for the default guarantees. If we were required to make a payment under a guarantee, we would receive a pro rata share should the third party collect some or all of the amounts due from the debtor. At December 31, 2019 , we had less than $ 1 million of default guarantees. 

Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

Other off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships. 

Indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. We provide certain indemnifications, primarily through representations and warranties in contracts that we execute in the ordinary course of business in connection with loan and lease sales and other ongoing activities, as well as in connection with purchases and sales of businesses. We maintain reserves, when appropriate, with respect to liability that reasonably could arise as a result of these indemnities. 

Intercompany guarantees. KeyCorp, KeyBank, and certain of our affiliates are parties to various guarantees that facilitate the ongoing business activities of other affiliates. These business activities encompass issuing debt, assuming certain lease and insurance obligations, purchasing or issuing investments and securities, and engaging in certain leasing transactions involving clients.

24. Shareholders' Equity 

Comprehensive Capital Plan 

As previously reported and as authorized by the Board and pursuant to our 2019 capital plan (which is effective through the second quarter of 2020 ) submitted to and approved by the Federal Reserve, we have authority to repurchase up to $ 1.0 billion of our Common Shares. During 2019 , we repurchased $ 379 million of Common Shares under our 2018 capital plan authorization and $ 489 million under our 2019 capital plan authorization. 

Consistent with our 2018 capital plan, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $ .17 per Common Share for the first and second quarters of 2019 . The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $ .185 per Common Share for the third and fourth quarters of 2019 , consistent with our 2019 capital plan. These quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $ .71 per Common Share for 2019 .

Capital Adequacy 

KeyCorp and KeyBank (consolidated) must meet specific capital requirements imposed by federal banking regulators. Sanctions for failure to meet applicable capital requirements may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments, require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital, terminate FDIC deposit insurance, and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases. In addition, failure to maintain a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; status affects how regulators evaluate applications for certain endeavors, including acquisitions, continuation and expansion of existing activities, and commencement of new activities, and could make clients and potential investors less confident. As of December 31, 2019 , KeyCorp and KeyBank (consolidated) met all regulatory capital requirements. 

KeyBank (consolidated) qualified for the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; prompt corrective action capital category at December 31, 2019 , because its capital and leverage ratios exceeded the prescribed threshold ratios for that capital category and it was not subject to any written agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Since that date, we believe there has been no change in condition or event that has occurred that would cause the capital category for KeyBank (consolidated) to change. 

BHCs are not assigned to any of the five prompt corrective action capital categories applicable to insured depository institutions. If, however, those categories applied to BHCs, we believe that KeyCorp would satisfy the criteria for a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institution at December 31, 2019 , and since that date, we believe there has been no change in condition or event that has occurred that would cause such capital category to change. 

Because the regulatory capital categories under the prompt corrective action regulations serve a limited supervisory function, investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank or KeyCorp. 

At December 31, 2019 , Key and KeyBank (consolidated) had regulatory capital in excess of all current minimum risk-based capital (including all adjustments for market risk) and leverage ratio requirements as shown in the following table.

25. Business Segment Reporting 

Key previously reported its results of operations through two reportable business segments, Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. In the first quarter of 2019, Key underwent a company-wide organizational change, resulting in the realignment of its businesses into two reportable business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank, with the remaining operations that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate 

reportable business recorded in Other. The new business segment structure aligns with how management reviews performance and makes decisions by client, segment and business unit. Prior period information was restated to conform to the new business segment structure. Additionally, goodwill was reallocated to the new segments on a relative fair value basis. On March 31, 2019, the Consumer Bank was allocated goodwill in the amount of $ 1.6 billion and the Commercial Bank was allocated goodwill in the amount of $ 912 million . 

The following is a description of the segments and their primary businesses at December 31, 2019 . 

Consumer Bank 

The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15 -state branch footprint by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, mortgage and home equity, student loan refinancing, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. The Consumer Bank also purchases retail auto sales contracts via a network of auto dealerships. The auto dealerships finance the sale of automobiles as the initial lender and then assign the contracts to us pursuant to dealer agreements. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist institutional, non-profit, and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs. 

Commercial Bank 

The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance. 

Other 

Other includes various corporate treasury activities such as management of our investment securities portfolio, long-term debt, short-term liquidity and funding activities, and balance sheet risk management, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios as well as reconciling items, which primarily represent the unallocated portion of nonearning assets of corporate support functions. Charges related to the funding of these assets are part of net interest income and are allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense. Reconciling items also include intercompany eliminations and certain items that are not allocated to the business segments because they do not reflect their normal operations. 

The table on the following page shows selected financial data for our major business segments for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . 

The information was derived from the internal financial reporting system that we use to monitor and manage our financial performance. GAAP guides financial accounting, but there is no authoritative guidance for &#8220;management accounting&#8221; &#8212; the way we use our judgment and experience to make reporting decisions. Consequently, the line of business results we report may not be comparable to line of business results presented by other companies. 

The selected financial data is based on internal accounting policies designed to compile results on a consistent basis and in a manner that reflects the underlying economics of the businesses. In accordance with our policies: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Net interest income is determined by assigning a standard cost for funds used or a standard credit for funds provided based on their assumed maturity, prepayment, and/or repricing characteristics. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Indirect expenses, such as computer servicing costs and corporate overhead, are allocated based on assumptions regarding the extent that each line of business actually uses the services. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The consolidated provision for credit losses is allocated among the lines of business primarily based on their actual net loan charge-offs, adjusted periodically for loan growth and changes in risk profile. The amount of the consolidated provision is based on the methodology that we use to estimate our consolidated ALLL. This methodology is described in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.&#8221; 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Income taxes are allocated based on the 2019 statutory federal income tax rate of 21 % and a blended state income tax rate (net of the federal income tax benefit) of 2.7 % . Prior to 2018, income taxes were allocated based on the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35 % and a blended state income tax rate (net of the federal income tax benefit) of 2.2 % . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Capital is assigned to each line of business based on economic equity. 

##TABLE_END &#160; 

Developing and applying the methodologies that we use to allocate items among our lines of business is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to reflect enhanced alignment of expense base allocation drivers, changes in the risk profile of a particular business, or changes in our organizational structure. ##TABLE_START Year ended December 31,
