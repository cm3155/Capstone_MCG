Our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation and could result in damage to our reputation. 

We provided $8 billion in funding and were the seventh overall lender in the PPP. The PPP and many lenders that participated in the PPP have been the subject of much publicity and regular media stories. There have been lawsuits by borrowers and purported agents against lenders related to the program, and we have been the subject of litigation related to the PPP. Although such litigation has not been material to date, our participation in the program could result in increased exposure to litigation in the future. In addition, our practices and procedures related to the PPP could be scrutinized by government or regulatory agencies. Government or regulatory scrutiny or increased litigation could result in financial liability or damage to our reputation. This could also result in increased legal and compliance costs.
