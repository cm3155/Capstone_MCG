The additional risk factor set forth below represents a new risk factor that has become applicable since the filing of our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Labor shortages and constraints in the supply chain could adversely affect our clients&#8217; operations as well as our operations. 

Many sectors in the United States and around the world are experiencing a shortage of workers. The shortage of workers is exacerbating supply chain disruptions around the world, causing certain industries to struggle to regain momentum due to a lack of workers or materials. Our commercial clients may be impacted by the shortage of workers and constraints in the supply chain, which could adversely impact our clients&#8217; operations. Clients may experience disruptions in their operations, which could lead to reduced cash flow and difficulty in making loan repayments. The financial services industry has also been affected by the shortage of workers, and Key has experienced the war for talent that is currently underway in the financial services industry. This may lead to open positions remaining unfilled for longer periods of time or a need to increase wages to attract workers. We have had to recently increase wages in certain positions to attract talent, particularly in entry-level type positions and certain specialty areas. Please also see the risk factor entitled &#8220;We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 37 of our 2020 Form 10-K.
