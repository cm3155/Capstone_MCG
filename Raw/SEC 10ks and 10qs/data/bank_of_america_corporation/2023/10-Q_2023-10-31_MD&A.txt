 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;hopes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, liquidity, net interest income, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, deposits, assets, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.

Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve released final 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test results for Bank of America. Based on the results, our stress capital buffer (SCB) declined to 2.5 percent from 3.4 percent, resulting in a Common equity tier 1 (CET1) minimum requirement of 9.5 percent effective October 1, 2023. 

On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future U.S. regulatory capital requirements, including the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. In addition, on August 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and eligible long-term debt requirements. For more information, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments on page 26. 

On October 18, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on December 29, 2023 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2023. 

For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 22. 

FDIC Special Assessment 

As previously disclosed, in May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank associated with their closures, and the systemic risk determination announced by the FDIC in March 2023. While the timing and amount of any expense recognition are unknown until the proposed rule is finalized, if the final rule is issued as proposed, the estimated impact of the special assessment on the Corporation would be a noninterest expense of approximately $1.9 billion that would be recognized upon finalization of the rule, which could occur in the fourth quarter of 2023. For more information, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net income was $7.8 billion and $23.4 billion, or $0.90 and $2.72 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $7.1 billion and $20.4 billion, or $0.81 and $2.34 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2022. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Total assets increased $101.7 billion from December 31, 2022 to $3.2 trillion primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents to support balance sheet and liquidity positioning, as well as higher securities financing activity. 

Total liabilities increased $87.8 billion from December 31, 2022 to $2.9 trillion primarily driven by higher securities financing activity and higher long-term debt and short-term borrowings to support balance sheet and liquidity positioning, partially offset by lower deposits primarily due to an increase in customer spending and debt payments, customers&#8217; movement of balances to higher yielding investment alternatives and seasonal outflows. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $13.9 billion from December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in net income, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased $614 million to $14.4 billion, and $5.2 billion to $43.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 5 basis points (bps) to 2.11 percent and 25 bps to 2.12 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs, lower deposits and net interest income related to Global Markets activity. For more information on net interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 46.

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,520 &#160; $ 1,573 $ 4,535 &#160; $ 4,531 Service charges 1,464 &#160; 1,466 4,238 &#160; 5,016 Investment and brokerage services 3,963 &#160; 3,795 11,654 &#160; 12,178 Investment banking fees 1,188 &#160; 1,167 3,563 &#160; 3,752 Total fees and commissions 8,135 &#160; 8,001 23,990 &#160; 25,477 Market making and similar activities 3,325 &#160; 3,068 11,734 &#160; 9,023 Other income (672) (332) (2,087) (1,863) Total noninterest income $ 10,788 &#160; $ 10,737 $ 33,637 &#160; $ 32,637 

Noninterest income increased $51 million to $10.8 billion and $1.0 billion to $33.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Service charges decreased $778 million for the nine-month period primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, as well as lower treasury service charges. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services increased $168 million for the three-month period primarily driven by higher asset management fees due to higher average market levels and the impact of positive assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by lower brokerage fees. The nine-month period decreased $524 million primarily driven by lower asset management fees and brokerage fees due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels and transactional volumes, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees decreased $189 million for the nine-month period primarily due to lower debt issuance and advisory fees, partially offset by higher equity issuance fees. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities increased $257 million and $2.7 billion primarily driven by improved trading in credit and mortgage products in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities. 

&#9679; Other income decreased $340 million and $224 million primarily due to higher partnership losses on ESG investments and losses on sales of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities in the nine-month period, partially offset by certain negative valuation adjustments in the prior-year periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $336 million to $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. In addition, provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from commercial net paydowns. For the three-month period in the prior year, the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period in the prior year was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure , partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Compensation and benefits $ 9,551 &#160; $ 8,887 $ 28,870 &#160; $ 27,286 Occupancy and equipment 1,795 &#160; 1,777 5,370 &#160; 5,285 Information processing and communications 1,676 &#160; 1,546 5,017 &#160; 4,621 Product delivery and transaction related 880 &#160; 892 2,726 &#160; 2,749 Marketing 501 &#160; 505 1,472 &#160; 1,365 Professional fees 545 &#160; 525 1,609 &#160; 1,493 Other general operating 890 &#160; 1,171 3,050 &#160; 3,096 Total noninterest expense $ 15,838 &#160; $ 15,303 $ 48,114 &#160; $ 45,895 

Noninterest expense increased $535 million to $15.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher investments in people and technology, higher FDIC expense and costs related to a liquidating business activity, partially offset by lower litigation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 

2023, noninterest expense increased $2.2 billion to $48.1 billion compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher investments in people and technology and higher FDIC expense, partially offset by lower litigation expense and revenue-related compensation. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Income before income taxes $ 8,095 &#160; $ 8,301 $ 25,218 &#160; $ 23,072 Income tax expense 293 &#160; 1,219 1,847 &#160; 2,676 Effective tax rate 3.6 &#160; % 14.7 % 7.3 &#160; % 11.6 % 

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included discrete benefits of $212 million and $422 million primarily related to certain U.S. state law changes 

in the three-month period, as well as other discrete benefits primarily related to resolution of U.S. federal and state tax matters in the nine-month period. Absent the ESG tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been 25 percent for both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and 26 percent and 25 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

When presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible 

common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 8. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 49. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 106. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 8. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 11.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital 

plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for GWIM decreased $157 million to $1.0 billion primarily due to higher noninterest expense and lower revenue. The operating margin was 26 percent compared to 29 percent a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $226 million to $1.8 billion primarily driven by lower deposit balances and a mix shift to higher yielding deposit products. 

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $118 million to $3.6 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher asset management fees due to higher average market levels and the impact of positive AUM flows, partially offset by lower brokerage fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $134 million to $4.0 billion primarily due to continued investments in the business, including strategic hiring, as well as higher FDIC expense. 

The return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, down from 27 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital. 

Average loans decreased $5.2 billion to $218.6 billion primarily driven by securities-based lending and custom lending, partially offset by residential mortgage. Average deposits decreased $47.7 billion to $291.8 billion primarily driven by 

clients moving deposits to higher yielding investment alternatives, including offerings on our investment and brokerage platforms. 

Merrill Wealth Management revenue of $4.4 billion decreased three percent primarily driven by lower net interest income from lower deposit balances and a mix shift to higher yielding deposit products, as well as lower brokerage fees, partially offset by higher asset management fees from higher market levels and the impact of positive AUM flows. 

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $923 million increased two percent primarily driven by higher asset management fees from higher market levels and the impact of positive AUM flows.

Merrill Wealth Management revenue of $13.1 billion decreased four percent primarily driven by lower asset management fees and brokerage fees due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels and transactional volumes, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows. 

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $2.7 billion increased two percent primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion, as well as higher net interest income due to higher interest rates.

Including and excluding net DVA, FICC revenue increased $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion primarily driven by an improved trading environment for credit and mortgage products and an increase 

in secured financing activity. Including and excluding net DVA, Equities revenue decreased $264 million and $251 million driven by weaker trading performance in derivatives, partially offset by an increase in client financing activities.

All Other primarily consists of asset and liability management (ALM) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Results for All Other improved $370 million to net income of $89 million from a net loss in the prior-year period, reflecting a higher income tax benefit and lower noninterest expense, mostly offset by lower noninterest income. 

Noninterest income decreased $881 million primarily due to higher partnership losses for ESG investments. 

Noninterest expense decreased $123 million primarily driven by higher litigation expense in the prior-year period due to a legacy monoline insurance litigation settlement, partially offset by higher costs related to a liquidating business activity in the current-year period. 

The income tax benefit increased $1.1 billion, reflecting an increase in tax preference benefits primarily due to income tax 

credits related to ESG investment activity. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets . 

Nine-Month Comparison 

The net loss in All Other decreased $763 million to $200 million primarily due to a higher income tax benefit and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income. 

Noninterest income decreased $1.5 billion primarily due to higher partnership losses for ESG investments and losses on sales of AFS debt securities, partially offset by derivative gains related to risk management activities. 

Noninterest expense decreased $338 million primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion and expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters in the prior-year period. 

The income tax benefit increased $1.8 billion primarily due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets .

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation&#8217;s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits. 

For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. Based on 2023 stress test results, our SCB is 2.5 percent effective October 1, 2023. For more information, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; Capital Management on page 3. 

In October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporation&#8217;s $25 billion common stock repurchase program (October 2021 Authorization). Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board&#8217;s authorizations, during the third quarter of 2023, we repurchased $1.0 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. In September 2023, the Board modified the October 2021 Authorization, effective October 1, 2023, to include repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans when determining the remaining repurchase authority. As of October 1, 2023, the remaining repurchase authority was approximately $13.6 billion (including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans). 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a BHC, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2023, the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirements were 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach and 9.5 percent under the Advanced approaches. Effective October 1, 2023, our CET1 minimum requirement is 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee&#8217;s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation&#8217;s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase 50 bps on January 1, 2024, which would increase our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to the anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.

(1) Capital ratios as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020. 

(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches) or the SCB of 3.4 percent (under the Standardized approach), as applicable, at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

At September 30, 2023, CET1 capital was $194.2 billion, an increase of $14.2 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by dividends and common stock repurchases. Tier 1 capital increased $14.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $12.4 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by a decrease in subordinated 

debt. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2023, increased $27.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1,632 billion primarily due to higher counterparty exposures in Global Markets and loan growth. Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2023 increased $73.9 billion primarily due to higher cash held at central banks, partially offset by lower debt securities balances.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

TLAC consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is 

required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Regulatory Developments 

On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future U.S. regulatory capital requirements. Under the capital proposal, the Advanced approaches would be replaced with a new standardized approach, referred to as the expanded risk-based approach, which would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. U.S. banking regulators also issued proposed rules to revise the risk-based capital surcharge for G-SIBs, which would be effective two calendar quarters after finalization. On August 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would change the criteria for debt instruments included in the Corporation&#8217;s eligible long-term debt and TLAC. Any final rules issued are subject to change from the current proposals. The Corporation is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rules on its regulatory capital, eligible long-term debt and TLAC requirements. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). On August 13, 2023, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) merged into its immediate parent, BofAS. Prior to that date, MLPCC was a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provided clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. Following the merger, client services previously provided by MLPCC are now being provided by or through BofAS. 

The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPF&#38;S computes its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a futures commission merchant and is subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2023, BofAS had tentative net capital of $25.1 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $23.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.3 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At September 30, 2023, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $6.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $136 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2023, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.7 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $10.8 billion. 

BofASE, an authorized credit institution with its head office located in France, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At September 30, 2023, BofASE's capital resources were $9.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.5 billion. 

In addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at September 30, 2023 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act.

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve 

Bank of America 26 

that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from increased volatility due to the failure of certain financial institutions in the first half of 2023. Our practices have also allowed us to effectively manage market fluctuations from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risks, see the Liquidity section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company (the Parent), which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash 

is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. 

Table 13 presents average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $327 billion and $348 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $582 billion and $605 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 116 percent and 120 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a 

consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with the U.S. NSFR. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.88 trillion and $1.93 trillion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Deposits 

Our deposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography and product type across our business segments. At September 30, 2023, 52 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 15 percent in GWIM and 26 percent in Global Banking . We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of liquidity. At September 30, 2023, approximately 67 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 30 percent and 34 percent of our deposits were noninterest-bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. Deposits at September 30, 2023 decreased $45.7 billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in customer spending and debt payments, customers&#8217; movement of balances to higher yielding investment alternatives and seasonal outflows. 

Long-term Debt 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued $54.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $23.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $18.7 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.3 billion of other debt. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.0 billion consisting of $22.5 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $4.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.9 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2023.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt increased $14.4 billion to $290.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt maturities, redemptions, repurchases and valuation adjustments. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued $11.3 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 

11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 46. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. 

The ratings and outlooks from Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ratings and outlooks from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s) and Standard and Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings (S&#38;P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor 

BofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BofA Finance), is a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold, and is expected to continue to issue and sell, its senior unsecured debt securities (Guaranteed Notes) that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation. The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts) is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and, together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at September 30, 2023. The Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed (or effectively provided for the full and unconditional guarantee of) all such securities issued by such finance subsidiaries. For more information regarding such guarantees by the Corporation, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Credit Risk Management 

For information on our credit risk management activities, see the following: Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 30, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 35, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42, and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the Corporation&#8217;s loan modification programs, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s credit risks, see the Credit section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our asset quality remained relatively healthy. Our net charge-off ratio increased primarily driven by credit card loans, as delinquency trends continue to slowly increase off of historic lows; however, 

they remain below the same period in 2019. Nonperforming loans increased modestly compared to December 31, 2022 driven by the commercial real estate office property type, while commercial reservable criticized exposure increased driven by both office as well as other industries that have been impacted by the current environment. Uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical environment and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the U.S. unemployment rate remained relatively stable and home prices have increased slightly in recent months. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net charge-offs increased $345 million and $853 million to $804 million and $2.2 billion compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to late-stage delinquent credit card loans that were charged off. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $930 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $8.2 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and loan modifications for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2023. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio 

was in Consumer Banking, 46 percent was in GWIM and the remaining portion was in All Other . 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $504 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as paydowns outpaced new originations. 

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.0 billion and $11.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. 

Table 19 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio of $2.2 billion remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2023, $1.3 billion, or 61 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more increased $81 million. 

Of the $218.1 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2023, $62.8 billion, or 29 percent, of loans were originated as interest-only. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.5 billion, or six percent, at September 30, 2023. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2023, $66 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $925 million, or less than one percent, for the 

entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2023, $199 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $63 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of 3 to 10 years. Substantially all of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later. 

Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Home Equity 

At September 30, 2023, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At September 30, 2023, 83 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , seven percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and 

new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $10.2 billion and $11.1 billion, or 40 percent and 42 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2023, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.4 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $45.0 billion and $42.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The HELOC utilization rate was 35 percent and 38 percent at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $31 million to $479 million at September 30, 2023, primarily driven by returns to performing status and paydowns outpacing new additions. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2023, $273 million, or 57 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $118 million, or 25 percent, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Of the $25.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2023, as shown in Table 21, 11 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $4.3 billion at 

September 30, 2023. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2023, $45 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2023, $310 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. 

For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, 29 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.

Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2023 

and December 31, 2022. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 10 percent and 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Credit Card 

At September 30, 2023, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $6.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $99.7 billion as purchase volume and card transfers more than offset payments. Net charge-offs increased $345 million to $673 million and $836 million to $1.8 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to late-stage delinquent 

credit card loans that were charged off. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $592 million, and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $299 million at September 30, 2023. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $391.3 billion at September 30, 2023 from $370.1 billion at December 31, 2022.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At September 30, 2023, 52 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 48 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings 

in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $2.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $104.1 billion driven by declines in securities-based lending stemming from higher paydown activity due to higher interest rates, partially offset by growth in our auto portfolio.

Other Consumer 

Other consumer primarily consists of deposit overdraft balances. Net charge-offs increased $29 million to $387 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by higher overdraft losses due to industry-wide increases in check fraud activity. 

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Nonperforming 

consumer loans of $2.8 billion remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

At September 30, 2023, $502 million, or 18 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2023, $1.6 billion, or 59 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were current and classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $112 million.

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 30, 32 and 35 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage 

the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 32 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 39. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and loan modifications for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $1.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to growth in commercial real estate, primarily in Global Banking, and U.S. small business commercial. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, commercial credit quality deteriorated as nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure increased primarily driven by the commercial real estate office property type; however, the commercial net charge-off ratio of 0.10 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 remained low. 

With the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial Real Estate section herein, credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since December 31, 2022; however, we are closely monitoring borrower performance in the increased rate environment and emerging trends. Many commercial real estate markets are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. Recent demand for office space has been stagnant, and future demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $325 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $4.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $700.9 billion primarily driven by lower standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees and debt securities and other investments. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent and 56 percent at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Table 26 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Table 29 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $4.4 billion during the nine 

months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the commercial real estate office property type and U.S. commercial, partially offset by non-U.S. commercial. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 88 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2023, 62 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 22 percent in Global Markets , 14 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans decreased $2.2 billion, or one percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by Global Banking. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $2.0 billion, or 19 percent, driven by increases across a broad range of industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2023, 63 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 36 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM . Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $766 million, or one percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $598 million, or 22 percent, due to upgrades and sales of Russian exposure. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $3.4 billion, or five percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 

$73.2 billion with increases across multiple property types. The commercial real estate portfolio is primarily managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent and 19 percent of commercial real estate at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $3.0 billion, or 57 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by office loans. Office loans represented the largest property type concentration at 25 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2023, but only represented approximately two percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and has origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent. Reservable criticized exposure for the office property type was $5.1 billion at September 30, 2023, and approximately $8.7 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. Although we have seen collateral value declines in this property type, the majority of these loans remain adequately secured as of September 30, 2023. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we continued to see low default rates. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and included $415 million and $1.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. PPP loans decreased $593 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to repayment of the loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 55 percent and 53 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and represented 100 percent and 99 percent of the net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 100 percent for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease of $170 million in accruing past due 90 days or more for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by the repayment of PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 31 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $987 million to $2.0 billion. At September 30, 2023, 99 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured, and 63 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 89 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection, or when a modified loan demonstrates a sustained period of payment performance. 

(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Industry Concentrations 

Table 32 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $16.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Capital goods, and Retailing. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $173.5 billion, increased $8.4 billion, primarily driven by exposure to the Capital markets industry group during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $99.8 billion remained relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 38. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $93.3 billion, increased $6.0 billion, or seven percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in Trading companies and distributors and Machinery, partially offset by a decrease in Industrial conglomerates. 

There is uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies due to various macroeconomic challenges including geopolitical, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, and a number of industries may continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure. 

(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.6 billion and $10.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $8.9 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $23 million and $134 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to net losses of $56 million and $66 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 38. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 44. 

Tables 33 and 34 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing 

activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our non-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 35 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2023. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $27.0 billion in 2023 primarily driven by decreases in Germany, Japan and France.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at September 30, 2023 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $54.4 billion, which represents a decrease of $912 million from December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower 

exposure with financial institutions. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $33.4 billion at September 30, 2023, a decrease of $12.4 billion from December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower deposits with the central bank.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses increased $418 million from December 31, 2022 to $14.6 billion at September 30, 2023, which included a $921 million reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio and a $503 million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The increase in the allowance reflected a reserve build in our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by a reserve release in our commercial portfolio primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. The allowance also 

includes the impact of the accounting change to remove the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings, which reduced the allowance for credit losses by $243 million on January 1, 2023. For more information on this change in accounting guidance, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $931 million and $2.6 billion compared to $520 million and $1.5 billion for the same periods in 2022 primarily due to late-stage delinquent credit card loans that were charged off. The provision for credit losses increased $336 million to $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. In addition, provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from commercial net paydowns. For the three-month period in the prior year, the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties. 

The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $496 million to $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $160 million to $16 million and decreased $278 million to $26 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on market risks, see the Market section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 38 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 38 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 38 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 using a 99 percent confidence level as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The amounts disclosed in Table 38 and Table 39 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior quarter remained stable.

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 39 at the same level of detail as in Table 38. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading- 

related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2023 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book 

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 40 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Table 41 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to higher and lower rate scenarios was primarily due to changes in deposit product mix. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 22.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, the increase in net interest income would be impacted by any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding as our benefit in those scenarios would be reduced. Conversely, in lower-rate scenarios, any customer activity that results in the replacement of higher yielding deposits or market-based funding with low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce our exposure in those scenarios. 

For interest rate scenarios larger than 100 bps shifts, it is expected that the interest rate sensitivity will illustrate non-linear behaviors as there are numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated, that could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income, noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months, for example, over 200 bps, customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing will have non-linear impacts to larger short-end rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios, and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts, the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero. In higher short-end rate scenarios, deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate, leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 41. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives 

in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair value of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. These changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk. These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. Physical climate events may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or collateral value, or increased operational risk by impacting the Corporation&#8217;s facilities, employees, customers or vendors. Climate-related transition changes in policy, technology or the market may amplify credit risk through financial impacts to the Corporation or its customers or counterparties or increase market risk, including through sudden price adjustments. In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices, disclosures and commitments. 

47 Bank of America 

As climate risk spans all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for each of our seven key types of risk. 

We publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal). In connection with our Net Zero Goal, we set certain 2030 targets, including reducing emissions associated with our operations and financing activities, related to auto manufacturing, energy and power generation, and for our supply chain, including that a certain proportion of our global suppliers set their own climate targets (2030 Targets). We disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emission and emission intensity metrics for the above referenced sectors in our 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our financed emissions targets. 

We plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in our 2023 TCFD Report, which we anticipate publishing later in 2023, and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024. 

Achieving our climate-related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. 

Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein.

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
