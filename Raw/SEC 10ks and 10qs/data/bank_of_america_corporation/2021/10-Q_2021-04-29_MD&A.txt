Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

On March 19, 2021, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC, and together with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, the U.S. banking regulators) announced that the temporary change to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for BHCs and depository institutions issued in 2020 would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation&#8217;s lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s SLR was 7.0 percent. Excluding the temporary relief, the SLR would have been approximately 6.1 percent, which is 1.1 percent, or $35 billion, in excess of the 5.0 percent required by the Federal Reserve. 

Due to uncertainty resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic), the Federal Reserve required large banks to suspend share repurchase programs during the second half of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit common stock dividends to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that beginning in the first quarter of 2021, large banks would be permitted to 

pay common stock dividends at existing rates and to repurchase shares in an amount that, when combined with dividends paid, did not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. Pursuant to the authorization of the Board of Directors (the Board), during the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the period. This authorization equaled the maximum amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the period. 

On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases currently in place will end for most banks after June 30, 2021, following the completion of 2021 supervisory stress tests. Banks, including the Corporation, with capital levels above those required by the stress tests will no longer be subject to the additional restrictions as of July 1, 2021, and will be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s stress capital buffer (SCB) framework. 

On April 15, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time. The Board also authorized repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. For the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s repurchase plans will be consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s guidance that common stock repurchases and common stock dividends, when combined, should be limited to the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. Following the expiration of the Federal Reserve's restrictions, the Corporation expects to return additional capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends pursuant to the Board's authorizations. 

On April 22, 2021, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on June 25, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2021. 

For more information on our capital resources and regulatory developments, see Capital Management on page 18. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Corporation has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the pandemic. In recent months, COVID-19 vaccination rates have been increasing and restrictive measures have eased in certain areas. However, uncertainty remains about the duration of the pandemic and the timing and strength of the global economy&#8217;s recovery. To address the economic impact of the pandemic in the U.S., multiple stimulus packages have been enacted to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which established the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enacted in March 2021. 

As the pandemic evolves, we continue to evaluate protocols and processes in place to execute our business continuity plans and help promote the health and safety of our employees. We also continue to support the communities we serve by engaging in various initiatives to help those affected by COVID-19. 

Additionally, we continue to support our clients by providing assistance through various measures to those affected by the pandemic, including by originating PPP loans. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 278,000 PPP loans outstanding with a carrying value of $21.1 billion, which were recorded in the Consumer , GWIM and Global Banking segments. Since the PPP&#8217;s inception through April 22, 2021, we have received $12.1 billion in repayment from the SBA. Additionally, we have originated $8.7 billion in PPP loans year to date through April 22, 2021. 

Although the macroeconomic and public health outlooks improved in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2021, the future 

3 Bank of America 

direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens, including as the result of the spread of the more easily communicable variants of COVID-19, this macroeconomic environment could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition. 

For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

Following the 2017 announcement by the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that it would no longer compel participating banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021, regulators, trade associations and financial industry working groups have identified recommended replacement rates for LIBOR, as well as other Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), and have published recommended conventions to allow new and existing products to incorporate fallbacks or that reference these Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs). In March 2021, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced the dates for the cessation of all LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the ICE Benchmark Administration. The FCA confirmed that publication of all Euro and Swiss Franc LIBOR settings and most British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen LIBOR settings will cease or become no longer representative of the underlying market the rates seek to measure (i.e., non-representative) immediately after December 31, 2021, and most U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023. 

The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide IBOR transition program. As part of this transition program, in March 2021, the Corporation ceased offering adjustable-rate mortgages linked to LIBOR and began offering Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-linked adjustable-rate consumer mortgages. On April 1, 2021, the Corporation ceased the initiation of new GBP LIBOR-linked loans, bonds, securitizations and linear derivatives that expire after the end of 2021, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, in April 2021, the Corporation issued a $1 billion six-month floating-rate bank note referencing the one-month Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index to multiple investors. The Corporation continues to update its operational models, systems, processes and internal infrastructure. 

The Corporation also continues to work towards meeting the regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones on cessation of LIBOR; however, the market and client replacement of IBORs and adoption of ARRs continue to evolve and, as a result, could impact the ability of market participants and the Corporation to transition activity across or within categories of contracts, products, services and markets. Accordingly, the Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones, development and adoption of SOFR, credit-sensitive and other rates, access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products, and IBOR continuity beyond December 2021. Furthermore, U.S. and U.K. banking regulators have stated that they expect to increase 

regulatory scrutiny and intensify supervisory focus of financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness. 

For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. 

Net income was $8.1 billion, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 billion, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the same period in 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income. 

Total assets increased $150.4 billion from December 31, 2020 to $3.0 trillion primarily driven by an increase in debt securities due to cash deployed from continued deposit inflows, as well as higher trading account assets driven by an increase in inventory in Global Markets, partially offset by a decrease in loans and leases due to continued paydowns. 

Total liabilities increased $149.3 billion from December 31, 2020 to $2.7 trillion primarily driven by an increase in deposits due to additional government stimulus measures as well as seasonally higher deposits, an increase in trading account liabilities resulting from higher levels of short positions in Global 

Bank of America 4 

Markets and higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase driven by client activity in Global Markets . 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to net income and issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as well as market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income decreased $1.9 billion to $10.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 65 basis points (bps) to 1.68 percent. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by the deployment of excess cash into debt securities. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41. 

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,435 &#160; $ 1,272 Service charges 1,792 &#160; 1,903 Investment and brokerage services 4,063 &#160; 3,758 Investment banking fees 2,246 &#160; 1,388 Total fees and commissions 9,536 &#160; 8,321 Market making and similar activities 3,529 &#160; 2,807 Other income (441) (491) Total noninterest income $ 12,624 &#160; $ 10,637 

Noninterest income increased $2.0 billion to $12.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Card income increased $163 million primarily driven by increased client activity, merchant services and higher income related to the processing of unemployment insurance. 

&#9679; Service charges decreased $111 million primarily due to higher deposit balances driven by additional government stimulus measures. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services income increased $305 million primarily driven by higher market valuations and higher assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees increased $858 million primarily driven by higher equity issuance and advisory fees. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities increased $722 million primarily due to strong trading performance in credit, mortgage and municipal products, and gains in commodities from market volatility driven by a weather-related event, partially offset by reduced activity in other macro products. In addition, the prior-year period included market-related write-downs due to the pandemic. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses improved $6.6 billion to a benefit of $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan balances. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38. 

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Compensation and benefits $ 9,736 &#160; $ 8,341 Occupancy and equipment 1,830 &#160; 1,702 Information processing and communications 1,425 &#160; 1,209 Product delivery and transaction related 977 &#160; 777 Marketing 371 &#160; 438 Professional fees 403 &#160; 375 Other general operating 773 &#160; 633 Total noninterest expense $ 15,515 &#160; $ 13,475 

Noninterest expense increased $2.0 billion to $15.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to elevated net COVID-19 costs, acceleration of expenses due to incentive compensation award changes, an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, higher revenue-related expenses and higher severance costs. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 9,166 &#160; $ 4,531 Income tax expense 1,116 &#160; 521 Effective tax rate 12.2 &#160; % 11.5 % 

The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 were primarily driven by recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. Excluding tax credits related to our ESG investment activity, our effective tax rate would have been 23 percent for the first quarter of 2021.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible 

common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 91. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and/or Table 5 on page 7. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 18. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as 

allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

9 Bank of America 

Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Consumer Banking Results 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $891 million to $2.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an improvement in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $942 million to $5.9 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $118 million to $2.1 billion driven by a decline in service charges primarily due to higher deposit balances and lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results, partially offset by higher card income due to increased client activity. 

The provision for credit losses improved $2.9 billion to a benefit of $617 million primarily due to a reserve release, as the macroeconomic outlook improved and our credit quality remained strong. Noninterest expense increased $635 million to $5.1 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate rationalization, incremental expense to support customers and employees during the pandemic, the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform. 

The return on average allocated capital was 28 percent, up from 19 percent, driven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9. 

Deposits 

Net income for Deposits decreased $1.0 billion to $674 million primarily driven by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income declined $670 million to $3.3 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $186 million to $898 million primarily driven by lower service charges due to higher deposit balances, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $41 million to $74 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $484 million to $3.2 billion driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, continued investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the pandemic. 

Average deposits increased $186.0 billion to $917.3 billion driven by strong organic growth and additional government stimulus measures of $112.1 billion in checking and time deposits and $73.1 billion in traditional savings and money market savings. 

The table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

Consumer investment assets increased $112.3 billion to $324.5 billion driven by market performance and client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two million reflecting continuing changes in our customers&#8217; banking preferences. We had a net increase of 27 financial centers as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network. 

Consumer Lending 

Net income for Consumer Lending was $2.0 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined $272 million to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest income increased $68 million to $1.3 billion primarily driven by higher card income due to increased client activity. 

The provision for credit losses improved $2.8 billion to a benefit of $691 million primarily due to a reserve release, as the macroeconomic outlook improved and our credit quality remained strong. Noninterest expense increased $151 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the pandemic. 

Average loans decreased $25.2 billion to $286.3 billion primarily driven by a decline in credit cards and residential mortgage. In addition, the prior-year period excluded PPP loans, which we began originating in the second quarter of 2020. 

The table below provides key performance indicators for Consumer Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the total risk-adjusted margin increased 135 bps compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by higher net interest margin and fee income. Total credit card purchase volumes increased $212 million to $64.6 billion as spending began to recover, with improvements in retail, warehouse and services, while travel remained suppressed. Debit card purchase volumes increased $19.3 billion to $107.9 billion due to the impacts of government stimulus measures, tax refunds and continued retail growth from the pandemic recovery.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank. For more information about GWIM , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net income for GWIM of $881 million remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, as higher noninterest income and improvement in the provision for credit losses were largely offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income. The operating margin remained relatively unchanged at 23 percent compared to a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $240 million to $1.3 billion due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of strong deposit and loan growth. 

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $275 million to $3.6 billion primarily due to higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. 

The provision for credit losses improved $254 million to a benefit of $65 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $263 million to $3.9 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentives and investments in primary sales professionals. 

The return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, down from 23 percent, due to an increase in allocated capital. 

Average loans increased $9.9 billion to $188.5 billion primarily driven by securities-based lending, custom lending and residential mortgage. Average deposits increased $63.0 billion to $326.4 billion primarily driven by inflows resulting from client responses to market volatility and lower spending. 

MLGWM revenue of $4.2 billion increased three percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. 

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $786 million decreased nine percent primarily driven by the realignment of certain business results to MLGWM and the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and AUM flows.

For more information about Global Banking, s ee Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net income for Global Banking increased $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $33 million to $4.6 billion driven by higher noninterest income, largely offset by lower net interest income. 

Net interest income decreased $632 million to $2.0 billion primarily driven by lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by higher deposit balances and credit spreads. 

Noninterest income increased $665 million to $2.7 billion driven by higher investment banking fees and higher valuation driven adjustments on the fair value loan portfolio, debt securities and leveraged loans, partially offset by weather-related impairment charges on certain renewable energy investments. 

The provision for credit losses improved $3.2 billion to a benefit of $1.1 billion primarily driven by a reserve release due to the improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Noninterest expense increased $463 million reflecting higher revenue-related incentives, as well as an acceleration in expenses from incentive compensation award changes. 

The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from one percent, due to higher net income. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Business Lending revenue decreased $407 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower loan balances and interest rates, as well as weather-related impairment charges on certain renewable energy investments. 

Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $360 million driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher deposit balances. 

Average loans and leases decreased 17 percent driven by client paydowns and decreased new originations due to lower demand. 

Average deposits increased 27 percent primarily driven by elevated balances from prior-year inflows on client responses to market volatility and government stimulus measures.

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6. 

Net income for Global Markets increased $349 million to $2.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Net DVA losses were $2 million compared to gains of $300 million during the same period in 2020. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $579 million to $2.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven by 

higher revenue and improvement in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $1.0 billion to $6.2 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue increased $443 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $745 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities. 

The provision for credit losses improved $112 million to a benefit of $5 million primarily due to the improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Noninterest expense increased $612 million to $3.4 billion driven by volume-related expenses in both card and sales and trading, as well as an acceleration in expenses from incentive compensation award changes. 

Average total assets increased $10.2 billion to $723.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 as reductions in FICC were more than offset by higher client balances in Global Equities. Period-end total assets increased $129.1 billion from December 31, 2020 

Bank of America 16 

to $745.7 billion driven by higher client balances and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Global Equities and higher levels of inventory in FICC. 

The return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, up from 19 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Equities net DVA gains were $7 million and $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. 

FICC revenue increased $580 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 reflecting a strong performance in credit, mortgage and municipal products, and gains in commodities (partially offset by related losses in another segment) from market volatility driven by a weather-related event, partially offset by reduced activity in other macro products. Equities revenue increased $165 million driven by a strong trading performance in cash.

All Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which 

substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results for All Other improved $744 million to net income of $257 million from a net loss of $487 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvement in provision for credit losses and revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

The provision for credit losses improved $161 million to a benefit of $47 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Noninterest expense increased $67 million primarily due to higher technology costs. 

The income tax benefit increased $609 million reflecting a higher level of income tax credits associated with increased ESG investment activities. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties.

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation&#8217;s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line-of-business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. 

For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pandemic-related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. 

For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2020 CCAR supervisory stress tests, we are subject to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period (the sum of our CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In April 2021, we submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has announced that it will disclose CCAR capital plan supervisory stress test results by July 1, 2021. 

Due to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve required large banks to suspend share repurchase programs during the second half of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit common stock dividends to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that beginning in the first quarter of 2021, large banks would be permitted to pay common stock dividends at existing rates and to repurchase shares in an amount that, 

Bank of America 18 

when combined with dividends paid, did not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. On January 19, 2021, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2021. The Board also authorized the repurchase of $2.9 billion in common stock through March 31, 2021, plus repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The Board&#8217;s authorization equaled the maximum amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the period. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the period. 

On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases currently in place will end for most banks after June 30, 2021, following the completion of 2021 supervisory stress tests. Banks, including the Corporation, with capital levels above those required by the stress tests will no longer be subject to the additional restrictions as of July 1, 2021, and will be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s SCB framework. 

On April 15, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time. The Board also authorized repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. For the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s repurchase plans will be consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s guidance that common stock repurchases and common stock dividends, when combined, should be limited to the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. Following the expiration of the Federal Reserve's restrictions, the Corporation expects to return additional capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends pursuant to the Board's authorizations. 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases made pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or 

privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of March 31, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer or SCB, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.

(1) As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard. 

(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

(5) Supplementary leverage exposure reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks for both periods. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021. 

At March 31, 2021, CET1 capital was $177.8 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by earnings, partially offset by common stock repurchases, dividends and lower net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). Total capital under the Standardized approach decreased $1.9 billion primarily driven by a decrease in the adjusted allowance for credit losses 

included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by the same factors driving the increase in CET1 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at March 31, 2021, increased $28.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $1,508 billion primarily due to strong client activity in Global Markets and investments of excess liquidity.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the 

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 11 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Regulatory Developments 

The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio 

On March 19, 2021, the U.S. banking regulators announced that the temporary change to the SLR for BHCs and depository institutions issued in 2020 would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation&#8217;s lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s SLR was 7.0 percent. Excluding the temporary relief, the SLR would have been approximately 6.1 percent, which is 1.1 percent, or $35 billion, in excess of the 5.0 percent required by the Federal Reserve. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a 

certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At March 31, 2021, BofAS had tentative net capital of $15.2 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $12.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.9 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At March 31, 2021, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $5.9 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At March 31, 2021, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $3.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $175 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2021, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.9 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.3 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2021, BofASE's capital resources were $5.8 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $2.2 billion. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

23 Bank of America 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

Table 12 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $294 billion and $306 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and 

transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $577 billion and $584 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 117 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule 

On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule is effective July 1, 2021. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured 

Bank of America 24 

depository institutions. The Corporation expects to be in compliance within the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline provided and does not expect any significant impacts to the Corporation. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.88 trillion and $1.80 trillion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and 

repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Long-term Debt 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we issued $13.1 billion of long-term debt consisting of $8.1 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $1.3 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $3.7 billion of other debt. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $13.9 billion consisting of $9.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $922 million for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.4 billion of other debt. Table 14 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2021.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt decreased $11.7 billion to $251.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to debt maturities and redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we issued $1.1 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be 

required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the economy gained momentum as unemployment continued to decline from double-digit highs during 2020 and parts of the economy continued to open as vaccination rates increased, case levels showed improvements and restrictions generally began to ease. Individuals and businesses in the U.S. continue to receive various forms of support through economic stimulus packages enacted in 2020 and 2021. While there has been improvement, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the economy's recovery, which could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. For more information on how the pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Item 1A.

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

The economic environment improved during the three months ended March 31, 2021, with the U.S. unemployment rate continuing to decline and home prices increasing. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, deferral activity led to an increase in nonperforming loans, while net charge-offs decreased $179 million to $693 million primarily due to lower credit card losses as balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $1.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $8.6 billion due to an improved economic outlook and loan balance declines. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38.

(2) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage includes $527 million and $537 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $201 million and $225 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. 

(3) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $45.4 billion and $46.4 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $42.4 billion and $41.1 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(4) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $275 million and $298 million and home equity loans of $418 million and $437 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(5) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $12 million and $11 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 52 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2021. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 41 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased 

pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association, as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $8.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as paydowns were partially offset by originations. 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the residential mortgage portfolio included $12.0 billion and $11.8 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. 

Table 18 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(3) These vintages of loans accounted for $445 million, or 19 percent, and $503 million, or 25 percent, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $361 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by deferral activity. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2021, $1.3 billion, or 53 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $88 million. 

Net recoveries of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same period in 2020. 

Of the $202.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2021, as shown in Table 19, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $5.6 billion, or 10 percent, at March 31, 2021. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2021, $113 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.1 billion, or less than one percent, for the 

entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2021, $302 million, or five percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $112 million were contractually current, compared to $2.4 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 98 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. 

Table 19 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 16 percent of outstandings at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Home Equity 

At March 31, 2021, the home equity portfolio made up eight percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally 

convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At March 31, 2021, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $2.2 billion 

Bank of America 28 

during the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $13.2 billion, or 41 percent, and $13.8 billion, or 40 percent, were in first-lien positions. At March 31, 2021, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where 

we also held the first-lien loan totaled $5.4 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $41.6 billion and $42.3 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The HELOC utilization rate was 42 percent and 43 percent at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $21 million and $25 million and nonperforming loans include $92 million and $88 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(3) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(4) These vintages of loans accounted for 36 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $20 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily driven by COVID-19 deferral activity . Of the nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2021, $261 million, or 39 percent were current on contractual payments. In addition, $252 million, or 38 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $17 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Net recoveries increased $24 million to $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices. 

Of the $32.1 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2021, as shown in Table 20, 15 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $8.6 billion at March 31, 2021. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2021, $109 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 

days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2021, $484 million, or six percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 

Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, 18 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 

Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Credit Card 

At March 31, 2021, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $5.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $72.8 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes and higher payments. Net charge-offs decreased $136 million to $634 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to net charge-offs of $770 million for the same period in 2020 as balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs 

associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $372 million, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $148 million primarily due to charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020 and the impact of government stimulus measures. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $346.7 billion at March 31, 2021 from $342.4 billion at December 31, 2020.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At March 31, 2021, 50 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 50 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings 

in the direct/indirect portfolio remained relatively flat at March 31, 2021 at $91.7 billion.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 24 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, nonperforming consumer loans increased $366 million to $3.1 billion primarily driven by consumer real estate deferral activity. 

At March 31, 2021, $841 million, or 27 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at March 31, 2021, $1.6 billion, or 51 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current 

loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $22 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $101 million as the Corporation has paused formal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied properties during 2021. 

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 24. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the pandemic, most of which are not TDRs, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, and included $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $339 million and $361 million of loans classified as performing. 

(2) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of loans that were fully-insured. 

(3) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $417 million and $407 million, and include $236 million and $216 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $181 million and $191 million of loans classified as performing. 

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. 

Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $692 million and $701 million, of which $609 

million and $614 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. 

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our 

31 Bank of America 

non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 30, 33 and 36 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 33 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 35. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio as well as interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, commercial asset quality reflected signs of stabilization as the economic recovery gained momentum amid COVID-19 containment and vaccination progress. Accordingly, charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. While total commitments increased, outstanding loans decreased driven by paydowns given continued market liquidity. We had $21.1 billion of PPP loans outstanding with our small business clients at March 31, 2021, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in the tables in this section. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun to stabilize in many sectors as economies have reopened; however, certain sectors, including hospitality and retail, continue to be negatively impacted due to the pandemic. Moreover, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $1.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $7.5 billion due primarily to an improved macroeconomic outlook and loan balance declines. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $12.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $608.1 billion driven by lower loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at March 31, 2021 and 57 percent at December 31, 2020. 

Table 26 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At March 31, 2021, 63 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 20 percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans, including fair value option loans, decreased $4.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 driven by Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $3.2 billion, which was broad-based across industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At March 31, 2021, 77 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 23 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans, including fair value option loans, was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2021. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 37. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans declined by $1.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as paydowns exceeded new originations. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. 

Table 30 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and includes $21.1 billion and $22.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 90 percent were 

credit card-related products for both of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 31 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $156 million to $2.1 

Bank of America 34 

billion. At March 31, 2021, 82 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 56 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 85 percent 

of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. 

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. 

(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Table 32 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days 

past due. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the pandemic, most of which are not TDRs, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Concentrations 

Table 33 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $12.2 billion, or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $1.1 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Telecommunication services, Finance companies, Asset managers and funds, and Software and services industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Government and public education and Capital goods industry sectors. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $106.7 billion, increased $5.1 billion, or five percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $90.6 billion, decreased $1.8 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 34. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $78.4 billion, decreased $2.6 billion, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Given the widespread impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries have been and may 

35 Bank of America 

continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. The impact of the pandemic has also placed significant stress on global demand for oil, resulting in a steep decline in prices for much of 2020. However, oil prices rebounded late in the fourth quarter of 2020 and early in the 

first quarter of 2021. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $558 million, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $32.4 billion, driven by declines in energy equipment and services as well as oil, gas and consumable fuels. For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion. We recorded net losses of $36 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to net gains of $229 million for the same period in 2020 for these same positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the 

related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 39. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 40.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 36 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2021. These exposures accounted for 91 percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $23.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with the central bank of Japan and increased corporate exposure in Canada.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at March 31, 2021 was the U.K. with net exposure of $58.8 billion, which represents a $685 million decrease from December 31, 2020. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $43.5 billion at March 31, 2021, a $1.4 billion decrease from December 31, 2020. 

In light of the global pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will likely continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact to our international business operations as part of our overall 

response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. While vaccines have become more widely available in certain countries, the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. The impact of the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on the pandemic, see Item 1A.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses decreased by $2.7 billion from December 31, 2020 to $18.0 billion at March 31, 2021, which included a $1.2 billion reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio and a $1.4 billion reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio. The decreases were primarily driven

Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $823 million compared to $1.1 billion for the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in credit card and commercial losses. The provision for credit losses decreased $6.6 billion, reflecting a $1.9 billion provision benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The allowance for credit losses included a reserve release of $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook and loan balance declines. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $2.8 billion to a $756 million provision benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same 

period in 2020. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $3.8 billion to a $1.1 billion provision benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. 

The following table presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily 

39 Bank of America 

within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

We have been affected, and may continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 39 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option 

portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 39 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 39 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 39 and Table 40 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in diversification benefit between asset classes.

(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. 

The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 39. 

Bank of America 40 

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 40 at the same level of detail as in Table 39. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 40 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 

percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020. The increase in VaR for the 99 percent confidence level for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to pandemic-related market volatility, which impacted the 99 percent VaR average more severely than the 95 percent VaR average compared to the same period in 2020.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $24 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 74 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $6 million. 

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book 

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 41 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

41 Bank of America 

Table 41 Forward Rates March 31, 2021 &#160; Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 &#160; % 0.19 &#160; % 1.78 &#160; % 12-month forward rates 0.25 &#160; 0.24 &#160; 1.95 &#160; December 31, 2020 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.24 % 0.93 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.19 1.06 

Table 42 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 19.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. 

The sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 42. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $13 million and $163 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of 

Bank of America 42 

gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change. The financial impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk. Physical risk can also lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or collateral values. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. For more information on our governance framework and climate risk 

management process, see the Managing Risk and the Climate Risk Management sections in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
