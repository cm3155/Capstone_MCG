Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

In June 2021, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) notified BHCs of their 2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test results, which included a preliminary stress capital buffer (SCB) that was finalized in August 2021. Based on our results, we are 

subject to a 2.5 percent SCB effective October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, unchanged from the prior level. Our minimum Basel 3 Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio requirement also remained unchanged at 9.5 percent. 

On October 20, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board of Directors (the Board) renewed the Corporation&#8217;s $25 billion common stock repurchase program previously announced in April 2021. The Board&#8217;s authorization replaces the previous program. As with the April authorization, the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. The Board also declared a quarterly cash common stock dividend of $0.21 per share, payable on December 31, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 3, 2021. 

For more information on our capital resources and regulatory developments, see Capital Management on page 22. 

Organizational Changes 

During the third quarter of 2021, we announced certain changes to the Corporation&#8217;s senior management team. For more information, see the Corporation&#8217;s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on August 26, September 10, September 14 and October 20, 2021. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic) has impacted the Corporation and may continue to do so, as uncertainty remains about the duration of the pandemic and the timing and strength of the global economic recovery. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we regularly evaluate protocols and processes in place to execute our business continuity plans. In conjunction with our efforts to support clients affected by the pandemic, we have cumulatively originated $35.4 billion in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with amounts outstanding of $8.4 billion and $15.7 billion at September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021. For more information on PPP loans, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 35. 

The future direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens due to various factors, including through the spread of more easily communicable variants of COVID-19, such conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition. 

For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

Following the 2017 announcement by the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that it would no longer compel participating banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021, regulators, trade associations and financial industry working groups have identified recommended replacement rates for LIBOR, as well as other Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), and have published recommended conventions to allow new and existing products to incorporate fallbacks or reference these alternative reference rates (ARRs). Additionally, as previously disclosed, the FCA announced the dates that all LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the ICE Benchmark Administration will cease or become no longer representative of the underlying market the rates seek to measure (i.e., non-representative), 

3 Bank of America 

subject to the continued publication of certain non-representative LIBOR benchmark settings based on a modified calculation (i.e., on a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; basis). 

The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide IBOR transition program, and is particularly focused on contracts that reference certain IBORs that are expected to cease or become non-representative immediately after December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, a significant majority of the Corporation&#8217;s notional contractual exposure to LIBOR currencies that will cease or become non-representative on December 31, 2021 has been remediated, and the Corporation is continuing to remediate the remaining exposure. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, the Corporation is assessing and planning to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure to ARRs, including the previously disclosed New York legislation adopted in April 2021 for contracts that are governed by New York law and have no fallback provisions or a fallback provision based on LIBOR. Additionally, as part of this transition program, the Corporation continues to decrease initiation of new U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR-linked consumer and commercial loans that mature after June 30, 2023, subject to certain exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of ARRs in its USD consumer and commercial lending products and contracts. As previously disclosed, the Corporation has ceased initiation of GBP LIBOR-linked derivatives, subject to certain exceptions, and is prioritizing interdealer trading in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rather than LIBOR for certain USD interest rate swaps in accordance with recommendations by the Commodity 

Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Corporation continues to update its operational models, systems, processes and internal infrastructure. 

While the Corporation continues to work towards meeting the regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones on cessation of LIBOR, the market and client replacement of IBORs and adoption of ARRs continue to evolve and, as a result, could impact the ability of market participants and the Corporation to transition activity across or within categories of contracts, products, services and markets. Accordingly, the Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones, development and adoption of SOFR, credit-sensitive and other rates, access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products, and IBOR continuity. Furthermore, banking regulators in the U.S. and globally have increased regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus of financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness, including the use of credit-sensitive rates. 

For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net income was $7.7 billion and $25.0 billion, or $0.85 and $2.75 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $4.9 billion and $12.4 billion, or $0.51 and $1.28 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2020. The increase in net income was due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

Total assets increased $265.8 billion from December 31, 2020 to $3.1 trillion primarily due to the deployment of cash from continued deposit inflows into debt securities, as well as higher trading account assets due to an increase in inventory in Global Markets. 

Total liabilities increased $266.3 billion from December 31, 2020 to $2.8 trillion primarily driven by an increase in deposits due to continued government stimulus measures as well as seasonally higher deposits, an increase in trading account liabilities resulting from higher levels of short positions in Global Markets and higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase due to client activity in Global Markets . 

Shareholders&#8217; equity decreased $460 million from December 31, 2020 primarily due to returns of capital to shareholders 

through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as well as market value decreases on debt securities and derivatives, partially offset by net income. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased $965 million to $11.1 billion, and decreased $1.6 billion to $31.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 4 basis points (bps) to 1.68 percent, and 30 bps to 1.66 percent for the same periods. The increase in net interest income for the three-month period was primarily due to deposit growth and related investment of liquidity and the accelerated recognition of capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by lower loan balances. The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily driven by lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by higher balances of debt securities. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 46. 

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,583 &#160; $ 1,568 $ 4,604 &#160; $ 4,089 Service charges 1,928 &#160; 1,817 5,594 &#160; 5,282 Investment and brokerage services 4,236 &#160; 3,623 12,422 &#160; 10,803 Investment banking fees 2,168 &#160; 1,769 6,536 &#160; 5,316 Total fees and commissions 9,915 &#160; 8,777 29,156 &#160; 25,490 Market making and similar activities 2,005 &#160; 1,689 7,360 &#160; 6,983 Other income (248) (259) (987) (151) Total noninterest income $ 11,672 &#160; $ 10,207 $ 35,529 &#160; $ 32,322 

Noninterest income increased $1.5 billion to $11.7 billion and increased $3.2 billion to $35.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Card income increased $515 million for the nine-month period primarily driven by increased client activity and merchant services revenue. 

&#9679; Service charges increased $111 million and $312 million primarily due to increased client activity in the three-month period and higher treasury and credit service charges in the nine-month period. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services increased $613 million and $1.6 billion primarily driven by higher market valuations and assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees increased $399 million and $1.2 billion primarily due to higher advisory and debt issuance fees and increased equity issuance fees in the nine-month period. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities increased $316 million and $377 million primarily driven by strong sales and trading performance in Equities. The increase in the nine-month period was partially offset by a weaker performance in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), which benefited from market-related gains in the prior-year period. 

&#9679; Other income decreased $836 million for the nine-month period primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans in the prior year, as well as higher partnership losses on tax credit investments. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses improved $2.0 billion to a benefit of $624 million and $15.4 billion to a benefit of $4.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The benefit in the three-month period was primarily due to credit quality improvements. The benefit in the nine-month period was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Compensation and benefits $ 8,714 &#160; $ 8,200 $ 27,103 &#160; $ 24,535 Occupancy and equipment 1,764 &#160; 1,798 5,353 &#160; 5,302 Information processing and communications 1,416 &#160; 1,333 4,289 &#160; 3,807 Product delivery and transaction related 987 &#160; 930 2,940 &#160; 2,518 Marketing 347 &#160; 308 1,528 &#160; 1,238 Professional fees 434 &#160; 450 1,263 &#160; 1,206 Other general operating 778 &#160; 1,382 2,524 &#160; 2,680 Total noninterest expense $ 14,440 &#160; $ 14,401 $ 45,000 &#160; $ 41,286 

Noninterest expense increased $39 million to $14.4 billion, and $3.7 billion to $45.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Noninterest expense in the three-month period was relatively flat, as higher revenue-related expenses were largely offset by lower litigation expense and COVID-19 related costs. 

The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, a contribution to the Bank of America Foundation, higher costs associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits and an impairment charge for real estate rationalization. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 8,950 &#160; $ 4,546 $ 26,158 &#160; $ 12,876 Income tax expense 1,259 &#160; (335) 1,193 &#160; 452 Effective tax rate 14.1 &#160; % (7.4) % 4.6 &#160; % 3.5 % 

Changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods a year ago were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits on higher levels of pretax income and the impact of the 2020 U.K. tax law change. Also included in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change further discussed in this section. Our recurring tax preference benefits primarily consist of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing and renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges. Absent these tax credits and the impact of the U.K. tax law changes, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 25 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 27 percent and 26 percent for the same periods a year ago. 

On June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which included an increase in the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded a write-up of U.K. net deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion, with a corresponding positive income tax adjustment. This write-up is a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible 

common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 8. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 102. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 8. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 11.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 22. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as 

allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking Results 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $993 million to $3.0 billion due to higher revenue, lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $603 million to $6.5 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher deposit balances, the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results and the recognition of capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by lower residential mortgage and card balances. Noninterest income increased $196 million to $2.3 billion driven by higher service charges and card income due to increased client activity. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $232 million to $247 million primarily due to credit quality improvements. Noninterest expense decreased $284 million to $4.6 billion primarily driven by lower COVID-19 related costs. 

The return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, up from 21 percent, driven by higher net income. For more 

information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 11. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $4.9 billion to $8.8 billion primarily due to lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $357 million to $18.4 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and loan balances and the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit balances and the recognition of capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness. Noninterest income increased $430 million to $6.7 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The provision for credit losses improved $6.8 billion to a benefit of $1.1 billion primarily driven by reserve releases due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. Noninterest expense increased $474 million to $14.5 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation, cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs. 

The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, up from 14 percent, driven by higher net income.

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Deposits decreased $94 million to $3.2 billion 

primarily due to higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $154 million to $174 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $257 million to $8.8 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, and the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs. 

Average deposits increased $164.7 billion to $961.3 billion primarily due to net inflows of $93.8 billion in checking and time deposits and $70.1 billion in traditional savings and money market savings driven by strong organic growth and continued government stimulus measures.

Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets increased $68 million to $926 million primarily due to higher revenue (net of lower net DVA losses), partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net DVA losses were $20 million compared to $116 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $5 million to $941 million. The decrease was primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, largely offset by higher revenue. 

Revenue increased $236 million to $4.5 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking income. Sales and trading revenue increased $390 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $294 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in Equities, partially offset by lower revenue in FICC. 

Noninterest expense increased $150 million to $3.3 billion driven by higher activity-based expenses for sales and trading. 

Average total assets increased $124.0 billion to $804.9 billion driven by higher client balances in Equities, and higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC. 

The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, up from 9 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 11. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets decreased $573 million to $3.9 billion. Net DVA losses were $56 million compared to $77 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $589 million to $3.9 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by higher noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $578 million to $15.4 billion primarily driven by higher investment banking income and sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $243 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $222 million driven by higher revenue in Equities, partially offset by a decline in FICC revenue. Noninterest expense increased $1.6 billion to $10.2 billion, primarily driven by higher costs associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits, activity-based expenses for sales and trading, and an acceleration in expenses from incentive compensation award changes. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $200 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Average total assets increased $89.9 billion to $775.6 billion, primarily due to higher client balances in Equities and higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC. Period-end total assets increased $160.3 billion since December 31, 2020 to $776.9 billion driven by higher client balances and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Equities, and higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC. 

The return on average allocated capital was 14 percent, down from 17 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital.

Bank of America 20 

Three-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue decreased $101 million driven by a weaker trading environment for mortgage and interest rate products, partially offset by improved client flows in foreign exchange. Equities revenue increased $395 million driven by growth in client financing activities, a stronger trading performance and increased client activity. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue decreased $742 million driven by reduced activity in macro products, partially offset by stronger performance in credit and municipal products, and gains in commodities (partially offset by related losses in another segment) from market volatility driven by a weather-related event. Equities revenue increased $964 million due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income decreased $352 million to a loss of $54 million driven by a decrease in the income tax benefit and lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 

Revenue decreased $109 million primarily due to higher partnership losses for ESG investments. 

Noninterest expense decreased $208 million primarily due to lower litigation expense. 

The income tax benefit decreased $481 million primarily due to the impact of the 2020 U.K. tax law change in the prior year. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income increased $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion primarily due to a higher income tax benefit, partially offset by lower revenue. 

Revenue decreased $1.3 billion primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans in the prior-year period, higher partnership losses for ESG investments and lower market making and similar activities. 

The provision for credit losses improved $223 million to a benefit of $148 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Noninterest expense decreased $146 million primarily due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. 

The income tax benefit increased $3.0 billion primarily due to the impact of the U.K. tax law changes, and higher levels of income tax credits from increased ESG investment activities. For more information on U.K. tax law changes, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt and Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For more information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation&#8217;s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line-of-business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. 

For more information about the Corporation &#8217; s risks related to the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pandemic-related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. 

For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more 

information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. Based on the results of our 2021 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests submitted in the second quarter of 2021, we are subject to a 2.5 percent SCB, unchanged from the prior level, effective October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. Our CET1 capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 

Due to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve imposed various restrictions on share repurchase programs and dividends. In conjunction with its release of 2021 CCAR supervisory stress test results, the Federal Reserve announced those restrictions would end as of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the Corporation, and large banks would be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. Pursuant to the Board&#8217;s authorization on April 15, 2021, during the third quarter of 2021, we repurchased $9.9 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the period. On October 20, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board renewed the Corporation&#8217;s $25 billion common stock repurchase program previously announced in April 2021. The Board&#8217;s authorization replaces the previous program. As with the April authorization, the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases made pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer or SCB, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) 

Bank of America 22 

surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. The Corporation's CET1 capital ratio must be a minimum of 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are 

required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

Table 8 presents Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

(1) As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard. 

(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB or the capital conservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021 and is not reflected in supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2021. 

23 Bank of America 

At September 30, 2021, CET1 capital was $174.4 billion, a decrease of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by common stock repurchases, dividends and lower net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by earnings. Tier 1 capital decreased $2.3 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital. Total capital under the Standardized approach decreased $7.4 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the decrease in CET1 capital, and a decrease in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2021, 

increased $88.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $1,568 billion primarily due to strong client activity in Global Markets and an increase in debt securities resulting from the deployment of cash received from deposit inflows. Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2021 increased $729.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the expiration of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s temporary relief to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and an increase in debt securities resulting from the deployment of cash received from deposit inflows.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule.

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(1) As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, TLAC ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. 

(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. 

(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation&#8217;s Method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. 

(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021 and is not reflected in supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2021. 

Regulatory Developments 

The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio 

On March 19, 2021, U.S. banking regulators announced that the temporary change to the SLR for BHCs and depository institutions issued in 2020 would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation&#8217;s lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At September 30, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s SLR was 5.6 percent, which exceeds the 5.0 percent minimum required by the Federal Reserve. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to CFTC Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2021, BofAS had 

tentative net capital of $19.2 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $16.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.1 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At September 30, 2021, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $5.0 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At September 30, 2021, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $4.8 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $189 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2021, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.7 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.2 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2021, BofASE's capital resources were $7.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.1 billion. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial 

Bank of America 26 

obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

The parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent company assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service our debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had we not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) September 30 2021 December 31 2020 Bank entities $ 960 &#160; $ 773

160 &#160; 170 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources 

$ 1,120 &#160; $ 943 

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $318 billion and $306 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Parent 

company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. 

Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) September 30 2021 December 31 2020 Cash on deposit $ 241 &#160; $ 322 U.S. Treasury securities 265 &#160; 141 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $612 billion and $584 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 117 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule 

On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule was effective July 1, 2021. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. The Corporation is in compliance with 

27 Bank of America 

the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline provided, and there have not been any significant impacts to the Corporation. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.96 trillion and $1.80 trillion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Long-term Debt 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we issued $65.5 billion of long-term debt consisting of $49.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $6.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $9.5 billion of other debt. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $38.5 billion consisting of $21.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $8.0 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $9.2 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2021.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt increased $15.7 billion to $278.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt maturities and redemptions and valuation adjustments. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we issued $4.3 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be 

required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

We use derivative transactions to manage interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 46. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.

For information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 35, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42, and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the economy gained momentum as unemployment continued to decline from double-digit highs during 2020 and the economy continued to open as vaccination rates increased and restrictions began to ease. Individuals and businesses in the U.S. have benefited from various forms of government support through economic stimulus packages enacted in 2020 and 2021. While there has been significant economic improvement in comparison to 2020, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the economy's recovery, which may also be hampered by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures 

that could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. For more information on how the pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

The economic environment improved during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with the U.S. unemployment rate continuing to decline and home prices increasing. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, net charge-offs decreased $235 million and $635 million to $329 million and $1.5 billion primarily due to lower credit card losses, as balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, nonperforming loans increased due to deferral activity. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $2.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $7.2 billion primarily due to improvements in the economic outlook and credit quality. For

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage includes $466 million and $537 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $182 million and $225 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. 

(3) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $47.2 billion and $46.4 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $48.7 billion and $41.1 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(4) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $241 million and $298 million and home equity loans of $375 million and $437 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(5) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $13 million and $11 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2021. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio 

was in Consumer Banking and 42 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association, as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $6.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as paydowns were partially offset by originations. 

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the residential mortgage portfolio included $12.6 billion and $11.8 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements.

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $291 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily driven by deferral activity. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2021, $1.3 billion, or 55 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $402 million driven by continued improvement in credit quality. 

Net recoveries of $7 million and $17 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Of the $204.3 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2021, as shown in Table 20, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $5.1 billion, or nine percent, at September 30, 2021. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2021, $61 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more 

compared to $822 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2021, $287 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $107 million were contractually current, compared to $2.3 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 97 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. 

Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 16 percent of outstandings at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Home Equity 

At September 30, 2021, the home equity portfolio made up seven percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At September 30, 2021, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $5.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new 

originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $12.4 billion, or 43 percent, and $13.8 billion, or 40 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2021, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.8 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $40.8 billion and $42.3 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The HELOC utilization rate was 40 percent and 43 percent at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $26 million and $25 million and nonperforming loans include $86 million and $88 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(3) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $27 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as new additions outpaced returns to performing status and paydowns. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2021, $273 million, or 40 percent were current on contractual payments. In addition, $256 million, or 38 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $21 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Net recoveries increased $14 million to $34 million and $48 million to $93 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase was driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices. 

Of the $29.0 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2021, as shown in Table 21, 14 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $7.4 billion at September 30, 2021. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2021, $103 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 

days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2021, $484 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 

Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, 20 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 

Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Credit Card 

At September 30, 2021, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $76.9 billion as increased payments more than offset higher purchase volumes as spending continued to recover. Net charge-offs decreased $188 million to $321 million and $501 million to $1.4 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to balance declines and the impact of government stimulus 

measures, partially offset by charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $755 million, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $453 million primarily due to charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired in 2020 and the impact of government stimulus measures. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $359.0 billion at September 30, 2021 from $342.4 billion at December 31, 2020.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At September 30, 2021, 48 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 52 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings 

in the direct/indirect portfolio increased by $8.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $99.8 billion driven by client demand for liquidity and high asset values in the securities-based lending portfolio.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, nonperforming consumer loans increased $292 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by consumer real estate deferral activity. 

At September 30, 2021, $857 million, or 28 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs 

to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2021, $1.6 billion, or 52 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $36 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $87 million. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 25.

(3) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $390 million and $407 million, and include $232 million and $216 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $158 million and $191 million of loans classified as performing. 

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. 

Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $654 million and $701 million, of which $590 million and $614 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. 

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 31, 34 and 37 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 39. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio as well as interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, commercial credit quality improved as the economic recovery gained momentum amid COVID-19 containment and vaccination progress. Accordingly, charge-offs, nonperforming commercial 

loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $5.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Markets with most of the increase in investment grade exposures. This increase was largely offset by lower U.S. small 

business commercial loans due to PPP forgiveness. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun to stabilize in many sectors as economies have reopened. However, certain sectors, including hospitality, while showing signs of improvement, continue to be negatively impacted due to the pandemic. Moreover, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. Current and future office demand is uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $2.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $6.0 billion driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $4.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $615.4 billion primarily driven by lower derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at September 30, 2021 and 57 percent at December 31, 2020. 

Table 27 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2021, 62 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 21 percent in Global Markets , 16 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $7.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 driven by Global Markets . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $9.1 billion, which was broad-based across industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2021, 71 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 29 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $12.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily in Global Markets . For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans remained relatively unchanged at $60.7 billion as of September 30, 2021. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 22 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and includes $8.4 billion and $22.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The decline of $14.3 billion in PPP loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to repayment of the loans by the Small Business 

Administration under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 51 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and represented 100 percent and 96 percent of net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 93 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 32 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $530 million to $1.7 billion. At September 30, 2021, 82 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 65 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 87 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

Industry Concentrations 

Table 34 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $53.5 billion, or five percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $1.1 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Finance companies, Capital goods and Individuals and trusts industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Government and public education and Automobiles and components industry sectors. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $132.2 billion, increased $31.9 billion, or 32 percent, during the nine months 

ended September 30, 2021, which was primarily driven by secured investment grade exposures. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $94.5 billion, increased $2.7 billion, or three percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For more information on the commercial real e state and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 37. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $87.0 billion, increased $6.2 billion, or eight percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 with the growth largely occurring in building products, machinery and trading companies and distributors. 

Given the widespread impact of the pandemic on the U.S. 

and global economy, a number of industries have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion. For these same positions, we recorded net losses of $18 million and $86 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to net losses of $104 million and $106 million for the same periods in 2020. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and 

losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 40. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 44.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 37 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2021. These exposures accounted for 91 percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $26.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Japan and Ireland, and increased corporate exposure in Canada, Spain and Sweden.

In light of the global pandemic and considerations related to the ongoing economic recovery, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, we continue to manage our non-U.S. exposure closely in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. While vaccines have become more widely available in certain countries, the 

magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. For more information on the pandemic, see Item 1A.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $6.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to $14.7 billion at September 30, 2021, which included a $3.1 billion reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio and a $2.9 billion reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio. The decreases were primarily driven 

by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. 

Table 38 presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type for September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $463 million and $1.9 billion compared to $972 million and $3.2 billion for the same periods in 2020 driven by decreases across most products. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.0 billion to a $624 million benefit, and $15.4 billion to a $4.1 billion benefit, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The allowance for credit losses had a reserve release of $6.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $214 million to an expense of $81 million and $6.4 billion to a benefit of $1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared 

to the same periods in 2020. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $1.8 billion to a $705 million benefit and $9.0 billion to a $2.7 billion benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or 

otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily 

within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

43 Bank of America 

We have been affected, and may continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 40 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option 

portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 40 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 40 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 using a 99 percent confidence level, as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. The amounts disclosed in Table 40 and Table 41 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in diversification benefit between asset classes.

(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant.

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 41 at the same level of detail as in Table 40. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not 

necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 41 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 

percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 95 percent of the trading days, of which 82 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 

percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains over $25 million. 

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book 

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 42 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 42 Forward Rates September 30, 2021 &#160; Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 &#160; % 0.13 &#160; % 1.51 &#160; % 12-month forward rates 0.25 &#160; 0.30 &#160; 1.67 &#160; December 31, 2020 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.24 % 0.93 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.19 1.06 

Table 43 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily due to ALM activity and an increase in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 22.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 43. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Bank of America 46 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded gains of $13 million and $35 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $85 million and $313 million for the same periods in 2020. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate-related risks consist of two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change. The financial effects of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk. Physical risk can also lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or collateral values. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. For more information on our governance framework and climate risk process, see the Managing Risk and Climate Risk Management sections in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on our climate-related metrics that align with Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics published by the International Business Council of the World Economic Forum, see our Annual Report 2020 on the Bank of America website (the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 

Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy (ESRP) Framework aligns with our Risk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks, inclusive of climate risk. Effective management of 

climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and well-developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control that risk appropriately and in a timely manner, all of which remain key areas of focus, as we continue to build out and enhance our capabilities in this area. 

As outlined in our ESRP Framework, we are focused on supporting and financing areas critical to the transition to a low-carbon society. Accordingly, we have a goal, publicly announced in early 2021, to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050. More broadly, achieving this goal will require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies, including those that improve cost of capital for net-zero transition and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. In 2021, we also announced a goal to deploy and mobilize $1 trillion by 2030 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy by providing lending, capital raising, advisory and investment services, and by developing other client driven financial solutions. This latter commitment anchors a broader $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal to support both environmental transition and social inclusive development, which spans business activities across the globe. These goals are intended to help drive business opportunities and enhance risk management related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Given the extended period of these goals, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the relevant periods presented herein, and are not expected to have a significant effect in the near term. 

The foregoing discussion regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, includes &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more 

information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
