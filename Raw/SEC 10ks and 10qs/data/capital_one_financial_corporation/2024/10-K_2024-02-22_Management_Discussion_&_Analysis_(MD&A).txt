##TABLE_START SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA ##TABLE_END

The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance metrics for the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies.

Financial Highlights 

On February 19, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Discover in an all-stock transaction. Upon closing, each share of Discover common stock will be exchanged for 1.0192 shares of our common stock. The closing of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by our stockholders and the stockholders of Discover. See the &#8220;Agreement to Acquire Discover&#8221; section in &#8220; Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Overview&#8221; for additional information. 

We reported net income of $4.9 billion ($11.95 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $36.8 billion for 2023. In comparison, we reported net income of $7.4 billion ($17.91 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $34.3 billion for 2022 and net income of $12.4 billion ($26.94 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $30.4 billion for 2021. 

Our CET1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III standardized approach was 12.9% and 12.5% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See &#8220;Capital Management&#8221; for additional information. 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we declared and paid common stock dividends of $935 million and repurchased $600 million of shares of our common stock. See &#8220;Capital Management&#8212;Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases&#8221; for additional information . 

Below are additional highlights of our performance in 2023. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of 2023 and 2022, except as otherwise noted. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this &#8220;Executive Summary.&#8221; 

Discussions of our performance for 2022 compared to 2021 can be found in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8221; of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 

Total Company Performance 

&#8226; Earnings: 

Our net income decreased by $2.5 billion to $4.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by: 

&#9702; Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by growth and continued credit normalization in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 

&#9702; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits, the $289 million FDIC special assessment related to certain regional bank failures and the absence of $177 million insurance recoveries net of legal reserve activity received in 2022, partially offset by lower professional services. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#9702; Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher funding costs. 

&#8226; Loans Held for Investment: 

&#9702; Period-end loans held for investment increased by $8.1 billion to $320.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio. 

&#9702; Average loans held for investment increased by $19.3 billion to $311.5 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 

&#9702; Our net charge-off rate increased by 134 bps to 2.70% in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in our credit card loan portfolio. 

##TABLE_START 53 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Table of Contents 

&#9702; Our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 78 bps to 3.99% as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by higher delinquency inventories in our credit card loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses increased by $2.1 billion to $15.3 billion and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 53 bps to 4.77% as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. 

##TABLE_START CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END

The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2023 and 2022. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, &#8220;Business Segment Financial Performance.&#8221; This section should be read together with our &#8220;Executive Summary,&#8221; where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees, net of reversals, on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(1) Average yield is calculated based on interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period. Interest income does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. Average yield is calculated using whole dollar values for average balances and interest income/expense. 

(2) Past due fees, net of reversals, included in interest income totaled approximately $2.2 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in 2021. 

(3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled 

##TABLE_START 55 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

approximately $74 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. 

(4) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. 

** Not meaningful. 

Net interest income increased by $2.1 billion to $29.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher funding costs. 

Net interest margin decreased by 4 bps to 6.63% in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher asset yields and growth in our credit card loan portfolio. 

Our cumulative deposit beta increased to 60% as of December 31, 2023, from 35% as of December 31, 2022 primarily driven by product mix shifts toward higher rate products, deposit pricing lags catching up to earlier increases in market interest rates and competition. We define cumulative deposit beta as the ratio of changes in the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits to the increases in the upper limit of the federal funds rate during the current rising interest rate cycle. 

Table 2 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: 

&#8226; changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or 

&#8226; changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

(1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. 

(2) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. 

(3) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above.

(2) Includes gains of $86 million, losses of $78 million and gains of $69 million on deferred compensation plan investments for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts have corresponding offsets in non-interest expense. 

Non-interest income increased by $410 million to $7.5 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher treasury income due to higher interest rates and higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $10.4 billion in 2023, $5.8 billion in 2022 and $(1.9) billion in 2021 . 

Our provision for credit losses increased by $4.6 billion to $10.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by growth and continued credit normalization in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 

We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within &#8220;Credit Risk Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8.

Non-interest expense increased by $1.2 billion to $20.3 billion in the year ended 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits, the $289 million FDIC special assessment related to certain regional bank failures and the absence of $177 million insurance recoveries net of legal reserve activity received in 2022, partially offset by lower professional services.

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $1.2 billion (19.2% effective income tax rate), $1.9 billion (20.3% effective income tax rate) and $3.4 billion (21.6% effective income tax rate) in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings. 

Our effective income tax rate in 2023 decreased by 1.1% compared to 2022. We recorded discrete tax expense of $6 million in 2023 and discrete tax benefits of $71 million and $66 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

##TABLE_START CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS ##TABLE_END

Total assets increased by $23.2 billion to $478.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in our cash balances as we continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity given the market volatility and growth in our credit card loan portfolio. 

Total liabilities increased by $17.7 billion to $420.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by deposit growth due to our national consumer banking strategy, which includes our national brand and marketing strategy, caf&#233;s, and tech / digital investments, which have enabled us to both deepen and grow our overall customer base. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity increased by $5.5 billion to $58.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net income of $4.9 billion. 

The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2023. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to the timing of normal balance sheet management activities that are intended to support our capital and liquidity positions, our market risk profile and the needs of our customers. 

Investment Securities 

Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (&#8220;Agency&#8221;) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in Agency and U.S. Treasury securities represented 97% of our total investment securities portfolio as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio increased by $2.2 billion to $79.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 from 2022 primarily driven by increases in fair value due to decreases in interest rates and net purchases.

Funding Sources 

Our primary source of funding comes from insured retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. 

Table 6 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held $64.2 billion and $80.7 billion, respectively, of estimated uninsured deposits excluding any intercompany balances. These amounts were primarily comprised of checking and savings deposits. These estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 18% and 24% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our &#8220;Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income&#8221; (FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies. 

##TABLE_START 60 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Securitized debt obligations increased by $1.1 billion to $18.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances in our credit card and auto securitization programs. 

Other debt remained substantially flat at $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. 

We provide additional information on our funding sources in &#8220;Liquidity Risk Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 8&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management&#8217;s judgment that these future deductions are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to make these estimates. 

Deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, were approximately $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $280 million from December 31, 2022. The increase in our net deferred tax assets was primarily driven by an increase in our allowance for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in fair value of our available for sale securities and derivatives in 2023. 

Our recorded valuation allowance balances were $496 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income. 

We provide additional information on income taxes in &#8220;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 15&#8212;Income Taxes.&#8221; 

##TABLE_START OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ##TABLE_END

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in &#8220;Item 8.

##TABLE_START BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ##TABLE_END

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. 

The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. 

We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our &#8220;managed&#8221; presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

We summarize our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and provide a comparative discussion of these results for 2023 and 2022, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in &#8220;Item 8.

Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2023 compared to 2022, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2023 and 2022 include the following: 

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $3.1 billion to $19.7 billion in 2023 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $169 million to $5.9 billion in 2023 due to higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume and gains on our deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by the absence of a $192 million gain on the sale of partnership loan portfolios in 2022. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $4.4 billion to $8.7 billion in 2023 primarily driven by loan growth and continued credit normalization. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $863 million to $12.5 billion in 2023 primarily driven by increased operating expenses, including salaries and associate benefits. 

Loans Held for Investment: 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment increased by $16.8 billion to $154.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 driven by growth across our portfolio. 

&#8226; Average loans held for investment increased by $21.2 billion to $141.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by growth across our portfolio. 

Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate increased by 204 bps to 4.57% in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 

&#8226; The 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 116 bps to 4.62% as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by higher delinquency inventories.

Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by: 

&#8226; Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by loan growth and continued credit normalization. 

##TABLE_START 66 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

&#8226; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased operating expenses, including salaries and associate benefits. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#8226; Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins. 

&#8226; Higher non-interest income primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume and gains on our deferred compensation plan investments. 

Consumer Banking Business 

The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits as well as service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 

Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.3 billion in both 2023 and 2022 and $3.7 billion in 2021.

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $252 million to $8.7 billion in 2023 primarily driven by lower margins in our retail banking and auto businesses and lower average loan balances in our auto business, partially offset by higher deposits in our retail banking business. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $120 million to $589 million in 2023 primarily driven by higher interchange fees from an increase in debit card purchase volume and gains on our deferred compensation plan investments. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses remained substantially flat at $1.2 billion in 2023. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense decreased by $134 million to $5.2 billion in 2023 primarily driven by a lower level of auto originations. 

Loans Held for Investment: &#160; 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $4.5 billion to $75.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing new originations in auto.

Loss from continuing operations increased by $859 million to a loss of $1.5 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by higher funding costs and increased non-interest expense largely driven by the $289 million FDIC special assessment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher treasury income in non-interest income driven by higher market interest rates. 

##TABLE_START CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; 

We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; Loan loss reserves 

&#8226; Goodwill 

&#8226; Fair value 

&#8226; Customer rewards reserve 

We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. 

##TABLE_START 72 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Loan Loss Reserves 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses that represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans held for investment portfolios as of each balance sheet date. We also reserve for the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees related to credit card loan receivables in the allowance for credit losses consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables. We also separately reserve for unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. We build our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses, which is driven by charge-offs, changes in the allowance for credit losses and changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for credit losses was $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. 

Our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments utilize models to derive a quantitative estimate of credit losses that is supplemented with additional qualitative considerations to capture risks and uncertainties not included in the quantitative result. Our estimate of expected credit losses, for all loan and unfunded lending commitments, includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year and then reverts over a one-year period to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. We use externally produced consensus estimates as inputs for our forward-looking macroeconomic forecast and consider other forecasts and sources of uncertainty to develop the quantitative component. This quantitative result is then supplemented qualitatively by management for economic uncertainty, including the consideration of alternative macroeconomic scenarios, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in the quantitative component. These adjustments represent management&#8217;s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

We have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for credit losses. Significant management judgment is required to determine the relevant information and estimation methods used to arrive at our best estimate of lifetime credit losses. Establishing the allowance on a quarterly basis involves evaluating and forecasting both credit and macroeconomic variables. The macroeconomic forecast used to inform both quantitative and qualitative components of our allowance for credit losses estimate is sensitive to certain variables, such as the U.S. Unemployment Rate, and the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;U.S. Real GDP&#8221;) Growth Rate assumptions. Our December 31, 2023 allowance assumes that the quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate gradually increases to approximately 4.4% by the fourth quarter of 2024 and annual U.S. Real GDP increases 1.0% in 2024. 

In addition to macroeconomic factors, many credit factors inform our allowance for credit losses, including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, credit bureau scores, current general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for credit losses. 

We have a governance framework supported by processes and controls intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. Our governance framework provides for oversight of methods, models, qualitative adjustments, process controls and results. At least quarterly, representatives from the Finance and Risk Management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies, key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. Groups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of inputs requiring judgment as well as adjustments to results. 

We have model policies, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which govern the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance. 

In addition to the allowance for credit losses, on a quarterly basis, we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable which are generally in our Commercial Banking business. The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the Commercial Banking business. The reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and changes to it are recorded through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income.

Although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by operating segment, and changes in our allowance in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 4&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.&#8221; 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. 

Goodwill totaled $15.1 billion and $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2023 or 2022. See &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 6&#8212;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional information. 

We perform our goodwill impairment test annually on October 1 at a reporting unit level. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment may have occurred. An impairment of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance, Other Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking. 

For the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit&#8217;s specific regulatory capital requirements, economic capital requirements and underlying risks. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and other intangibles balances. Consolidated stockholder&#8217;s equity in excess of the sum of all reporting units capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs, such as dividends, share buybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is allocated to the reporting units and the Other category and assumed to be distributed to equity holders in future periods. 

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) calculation, a form of the income approach. This DCF calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit&#8217;s internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. Our DCF calculation requires management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. Discount rates used for our reporting units ranged from 8.3% to 12.4%, and we applied a terminal year long-term growth rate of 3.8% to all reporting units. The reasonableness of our DCF calculation is assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. The usefulness of market data is inherently limited due to the size and scope of our operations compared to most peer institutions and recent market transactions. The results of the 2023 annual impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by between 12% and 121%. We also compare the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization. Our assessment considers the level of premium expected to assume control of the Company in a market transaction including anticipated cost savings and other synergies that would be realized in a hypothetical transaction. 

The results of the 2023 annual goodwill impairment test for our Commercial Banking reporting unit concluded that, while the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, the percentage by which the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount had decreased to 12% from 17% in the 2022 annual impairment test. The assumptions leveraged in the valuation of each reporting unit, including the Commercial Banking reporting unit, and the related risk of changes in those assumptions are described further below. 

Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. A change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance as a result of industry or macroeconomic trends or changes in our strategy, adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends, decreases in revenue, increases in expenses, 

##TABLE_START 74

deterioration in a significant loan portfolio, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration of market conditions, declines in long-term growth expectations, an increase in disposition activity, adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period. We perform sensitivity analyses around certain assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. 

We have a governance framework supported by processes and controls intended to ensure that the accounting and disclosure for goodwill is appropriate. Our governance framework provides for oversight of assumptions, forecast inputs, methods, process controls and results. 

Fair Value 

Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, DCF methodologies or similar techniques. 

The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. 

We have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. 

Significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments&#8217; fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 16&#8212;Fair Value Measurement.&#8221; 

We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification, and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. 

##TABLE_START 75 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information. 

Our Fair Value Committee (&#8220;FVC&#8221;), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. 

We have model policies, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which govern the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance. 

The fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (&#8220;VAC&#8221;) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior manageme nt. There were no disputes escalated to the VAC for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Customer Rewards Reserve 

We offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management&#8217;s judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost. 

We use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use the weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including changes related to the mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. We continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. While the rewards liability is sensitive to changes in assumptions for redemption rates and costs and involves management judgment, we believe portfolio characteristics and historical performance are the best indication of future reward redemption behavior and are the primary basis for our estimate. We recognized customer rewards expense of $8.2 billion, $7.6 billion and $6.4 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our customer rewards reserve, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $7.4 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

We have a governance framework supported by processes and controls that are intended to ensure that our rewards liability estimate is appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for oversight of assumptions, inputs, methods, process controls and results. Additional controls are performed to ensure all underlying data used to derive the rewards liability is complete and accurate.

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ##TABLE_END

The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. 

Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action 

The Company and the Bank are subject to the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee, along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions. 

As a BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to PCA capital regulations. 

Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. 

We have elected to exclude certain elements of AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Prudential Regulation of Banking&#8212;Capital and Stress Testing Regulation&#8212;Basel III Finalization Proposal.&#8221; 

G-SIBs that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the &#8220;G-SIB Surcharge.&#8221; We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. 

Stress Capital Buffer Rule 

The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule, the Company&#8217;s &#8220;standardized approach capital conservation buffer&#8221; includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) . Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. 

The Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company&#8217;s supervisory stress test results. In particular, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the Company&#8217;s starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company&#8217;s projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company&#8217;s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. 

Based on the Company&#8217;s 2022 supervisory stress test results, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 was 3.1%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 7.6%, 9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. 

##TABLE_START 78 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Based on the Company&#8217;s 2023 supervisory stress test results, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is 4.8%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%, 10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 

The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC&#8217;s capital regulations, which are only applicable to the Bank, the capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, the Bank&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. 

If the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company and the Bank eac h exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each &#8220; well-capitalized. &#8221; The &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, and the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC&#8217;s PCA capital requirements. 

CECL Transition Rule 

The Federal Banking Agencies adopted the CECL Transition Rule that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital, the CECL Transition Election. We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. 

Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and the cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. 

##TABLE_START Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period

As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of $2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we have phased in 50% of this amount as of December 31, 2023. The remaining $1.2 billion will be phased in on January 1, 2024 and 2025 at $600 million per year. As of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio, reflecting the CECL Transition Rule, was 12.9% and would have been 12.6% excluding the impact of the CECL Transition Rule (or &#8220;on a fully phased-in basis&#8221;). 

Market Risk Rule 

The &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with 

##TABLE_START 79 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See &#8220;Market Risk Profile&#8221; below for additional information. 

For the description of the regulatory capital rules to which we are subject, including recent proposed amendments to these rules under the Basel III Finalization Proposal, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation.&#8221;

Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing 

We repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $600 million of shares of our common stock during the year ended 2023. 

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve announced individual stress capital buffer requirements for all large banking institutions, including the Company. The Company&#8217;s final stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is 4.8%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%, 10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit its ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of December 31, 2023, funds available for dividend payments from the Bank were $5.2 billion. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. 

We repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $600 million of shares of our common stock during the year ended 2023. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. The Board authorized stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases, tender offers, or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set expiration date and may be suspended at any time.

Risk Management Framework 

Our Risk Management Framework (the &#8220;Framework&#8221;) sets consistent expectations for risk management across the Company. It also sets expectations for our &#8220;Three Lines of Defense&#8221; model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the Company. Accountability for overseeing an effective Framework resides with our Board of Directors either directly or through its committees.

##TABLE_START 83 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Our Framework sets consistent expectations for risk management across the Company and consists of the following nine elements: 

##TABLE_START Governance and Accountability Strategy and Risk Alignment Risk Identification Assessment, Measurement and Response Monitoring and Testing Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) Risk Data and Enabling Technology Culture and Talent Management ##TABLE_END

Governance and Accountability 

This element of the Framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking and the interactions within and among our three lines of defense. 

We established a risk governance structure and accountabilities to effectively and consistently oversee the management of risks across the Company. Our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and management establish the tone at the top regarding the culture of the Company, including management of risk. Management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. 

Strategy and Risk Alignment 

Our strategy is informed by and aligned with risk appetite, from development to execution. The Chief Executive Officer develops the strategy with input from the first, second, and third lines of defense, as well as the Board of Directors. The strategic planning process considers relevant changes to the Company&#8217;s overall risk profile. 

Our Board of Directors approves a Risk Appetite Statement for the Company to set forth the high-level principles that govern risk taking at the Company. The Risk Appetite Statement defines the Board of Directors&#8217; tolerance for certain risk outcomes at an enterprise level and enables senior management to manage and report within these boundaries. This Risk Appetite Statement is also supported by risk category specific risk appetite statements as well as metrics and, where appropriate, Board Limits and Board Notification Thresholds. 

Risk Identification 

The first line of defense and certain Support Functions identify new and emerging risks, including concentration of risk, across the relevant risk categories associated with their business activities and objectives, in consultation with IRM. Risk identification also must be informed by major changes in infrastructure or organization, introduction of new products and services, acquisitions of businesses, or substantial changes in the internal or external environment. 

IRM and certain Support Functions, where appropriate, provide effective challenge in the risk identification process. IRM is also responsible for identifying our material aggregate risks on an ongoing basis. 

##TABLE_START 84 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Assessment, Measurement and Response 

Management assesses risks associated with our activities. Risks identified are assessed to understand the severity of each risk and likelihood of occurrence under both normal and stressful conditions. Risk severity is measured through modeling and other quantitative estimation approaches, as well as qualitative approaches, based on management judgment. As part of the risk assessment process, the first and second lines of defense also evaluate the effectiveness of the existing control environment and mitigation strategies. 

Management determines the appropriate risk response. Risks may be mitigated or accepted. Actions taken to respond to the risk include implementing new controls, enhancing existing controls, developing additional mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of the risk, and/or monitoring the risk. 

Monitoring and Testing 

Management periodically monitors risks to evaluate and measure how the risk is affecting our strategy and business objectives, in alignment with risk appetite, including established concentration risk limits. The scope and frequency of monitoring activities depends on the results of relevant risk assessments, as well as specific business risk operations and activities. 

The first line of defense is required to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management practices and controls through testing and other activities. IRM and Support Functions, as appropriate, assess the first line of defense&#8217;s evaluation of risk management, which may include conducting effective challenge, performing independent monitoring, or conducting risk or control validations. The third line of defense provides independent assurance for first and second line risk management practices and controls. 

Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation 

Risk aggregation supports strategic decision making and risk management practices through collectively reporting risks across different levels of the Company and providing a comprehensive view of performance against risk appetite. Our risk aggregation processes are designed to aggregate risk information from lower levels of the business hierarchy to high levels and to aggregate risk information to determine material risk themes. 

Material risks, new or emerging risks, aggregate risks, risk appetite metrics and other measures across all risk categories are reported to the appropriate governance forum no less than quarterly. Material risks are reported to the Board of Directors and senior management committees no less than quarterly. 

Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) 

Our capital management processes are linked to its risk management practices, including the enterprise-wide identification, assessment and measurement of risks to ensure that all relevant risks are incorporated in the assessment of the Company's capital adequacy. We use identified risks to inform key aspects of the Company&#8217;s capital planning, including the development of stress scenarios, the assessment of the adequacy of post-stress capital levels, and the appropriateness of potential capital actions considering the Company&#8217;s capital objectives. We quantify capital needs through stress testing, regulatory capital, economic capital and assessments of market considerations. In assessing its capital adequacy, we identify how and where our material risks are accounted for within the capital planning process. Monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy. 

We manage liquidity risk by applying our Liquidity Adequacy Framework (the &#8220;Liquidity Framework&#8221;). The Liquidity Framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. 

Risk Data and Enabling Technology 

Risk data and technology provides the basis for risk reporting and is used in decision making and to monitor and review changes to our risk profile. There are core Governance, Risk Management and Compliance systems which are used as the system of record for risks, controls, issues and events for our risk categories and supports the analysis, aggregation and reporting capabilities across the categories. 

##TABLE_START 85 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Culture and Talent Management 

The Framework must be supported with the right culture, talent and skills to enable effective risk management across the Company. 

Every associate at the Company is responsible for risk management; however, associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first, second and third lines of defense are critical to execute appropriate risk management across the enterprise. 

Risk Categories 

We apply our Framework to protect the Company from the major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. We have seven major categories of risk as noted below. 

##TABLE_START Major Categories of Risk Compliance The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations. Compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules or regulations Credit The risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor&#8217;s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the Company or otherwise perform as agreed Liquidity The risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time Market The risk that an institution&#8217;s earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors Operational The risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events Reputation The risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities Strategic The risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from the Company&#8217;s competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; lack of responsiveness to these conditions; strategic decisions to change the Company&#8217;s scale, market position or operating model; or, failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the Company&#8217;s strategy ##TABLE_END

We provide an overview of how we manage our seven major categories of risk below. 

Compliance Risk Management 

We recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. In response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations. 

Our Compliance Management Program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. The program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. 

##TABLE_START 86 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Compliance Management Program. Business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and our Compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls. 

Credit Risk Management 

We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans. 

The Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions. Our Chief Credit Officers are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. They also have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. Division Presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio. 

Our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. The standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. These standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. Starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

We recognize that liquidity risk is embedded within our day-to-day and strategic decisions. Liquidity is essential for banks to meet customer withdrawals, account for balance sheet changes, and provide funding for growth. We have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. We manage our liquidity risk, which is driven by both internal and external factors, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to continually assess our liquidity adequacy. 

The Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Head of Liquidity, Market and Capital Risk Oversight, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation. Results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee no less than quarterly. We also continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan (&#8220;CFP&#8221;) and our Recovery Plan. 

We use internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics within our Liquidity Framework to confirm we maintain a fortified balance sheet. We rely on a combination of stable and diversified funding sources, along with a stockpile of liquidity reserves, to effectively manage our liquidity risk. We maintain a sizable liquidity reserve of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality unencumbered securities and investment securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. We also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. 

Market Risk Management 

We recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk are present in our business due to the nature of our assets and liabilities. Market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. We manage market risk exposure, which is 

##TABLE_START 87 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure. 

The Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Head of Liquidity, Market, and Capital Risk Oversight, is responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. The market risk position is calculated and analyzed against pre-established limits. We use industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk and we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. Results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee no less than quarterly. 

Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate risk. In addition, we also use derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risk. 

Operational Risk Management 

We recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. We have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner. 

The Chief Operational Risk Officer, in collaboration with the CTRO, is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program. The program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. These risks include topics such as internal and external fraud, cyber and technology risk, data management, model risk, third-party management, and business continuity. Operational Risk Management and Technology Risk Management enforce these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. For additional information on how we manage cybersecurity and technology risk, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1C. Cybersecurity&#8221; of this Report. 

Reputation Risk Management 

We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. Areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our Company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. The Executive Vice President of External Affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies. 

Strategic Risk Management 

We recognize that strategic risk is present within our business and the Company&#8217;s strategy. We monitor risks for the impact on current or future earnings, capital growth or enterprise value arising from changes to the Company&#8217;s competitive and market positions, including as a result of evolving forces in the industry. Additionally, we monitor timely and effective responsiveness to these conditions, strategic decisions that impact the Company&#8217;s scale, market position or operating model and failure to appropriately consider implementation risks in the Company&#8217;s strategy. Potential areas of opportunity or risk inform the Company&#8217;s strategy, which is led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The Chief Enterprise Risk Officer, in consultation with the Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, oversees the identification and assessment of risks associated with the Company&#8217;s strategy and the monitoring of these risks throughout the year. 

Our Strategic Risk Management Policy, processes and controls encompass an ongoing assessment of risks associated with corporate or line of business specific strategies. These risks are managed through periodic reviews, along with regular updates to senior management and the Board.

Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policies and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. 

We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to ongoing credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, extending short-term advances on syndication activity including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten, depositing certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, executing certain foreign exchange transactions and extending customer overdrafts. We provide additional information related to our investment securities portfolio under &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Investment Securities&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#8221; 

Primary Loan Products 

We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary loan products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. 

&#8226; Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as Fair Isaac Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans. 

&#8226; Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, and are subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant&#8217;s income, estimated net disposable income, and credit bureau information including FICO scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratio. We maintain an auto securitization program. 

&#8226; Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and current market conditions. Although we generally retain the commercial loans we underwrite, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes, including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten. In addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises where we retain certain levels of residual risk after the loans are sold.

Credit Risk Measurement 

We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. 

We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. 

Table 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(1) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic Card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. 

(2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. 

In our commercial loan portfolio, we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower&#8217;s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. 

We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 3&#8212;Loans&#8221; for additional credit quality information and see &#8220;Item 8.

Delinquency Rates 

We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer&#8217;s due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day

Net Charge-Offs 

Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

Financial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers 

We adopted ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) and establishes disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which results in a more than insignificant impact to the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a modification was deemed a TDR when the contractual terms of a loan agreement were modified by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 eliminated the concession requirement for modifications. After the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a financial difficulty modification (&#8220;FDM&#8221;) occurs when a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of these modifications is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 

The types of modifications we offer to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty have not changed as a result of the adoption of ASU 2022-02. As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. 

We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including FDMs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. 

In our Credit Card business, the majority of our FDMs receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. 

In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. 

In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension. A portion of FDMs receive an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of modifications. 

For additional information on accounting standards adopted during the year ended December 31, 2023, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; For more information on FDMs in 2023 and TDRs in 2022, see Item 8.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

Our allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in &#8220;Item 8.

##TABLE_START LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE ##TABLE_END

We manage our funding and liquidity risk in an integrated manner in support of the current and future cash flow needs of our business. We maintained liquidity reserves of $120.7 billion and $106.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as shown in Table 28 below . Included in liquidity reserves are cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had available issuance capacity of $42.0 billion under shelf registrations associated with our credit card and auto loan securitization programs. We also maintain a shelf registration that enables us to issue an indeterminate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. Our ability to issue under each shelf registration is subject to market conditions. 

Finally, as of December 31, 2023, we had access to available contingent liquidity sources totaling $99.1 billion through pledged collateral, including a portion of the investment securities included in the liquidity reserve amount above, at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&#8212;Government Securities Division (&#8220;FICC&#8212;GSD&#8221;), FHLB and the Bank Term Funding Program (&#8220;BTFP&#8221;). 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our funding sources totaled $398.3 billion and $381.7 billion, respectively, primarily comprised of consumer deposits, as shown in &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition . &#8221; 

Our liquidity reserves, borrowing capacity, contingent liquidity sources and total funding sources are all discussed in more detail in the following sections.

Our liquidity reserves increased by $14.1 billion to $120.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the &#8220;Borrowing Capacity&#8221; and &#8220;Funding&#8221; sections below. See &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

We are subject to the LCR Rule as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the fourth quarter of 2023 was 167%, which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; for additional information. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

We are subject to the NSFR Rule as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The NSFR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to maintain an NSFR of 100% on an ongoing basis. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a semi-annual basis each second and fourth quarter, its NSFR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics and qualitative discussion of its NSFR. Our average NSFR for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2023 was 135%, which exceeded the NSFR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of the relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; for additional information. 

Borrowing Capacity 

We maintain a shelf registration with the SEC so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $30 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. As of December 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion and $19.4 billion of available issuance capacity in our credit card and auto loan securitization programs, respectively. 

In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have pledged collateral to support our access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, BTFP and FICC&#8212;GSD general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. For each of these programs, the ability to borrow utilizing these sources is dependent on meeting the respective membership requirements. Our borrowing capacity in each program is a function of the collateral the Bank has posted with each counterparty, including any respective haircuts applied to that collateral. 

As of December 31, 2023, we pledged both loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $32.1 billion, of which $50 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $18 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

As a member of FICC&#8212;GSD, we have $16.1 billion of readily available borrowing capacity secured by securities from our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023. Our FICC&#8212;GSD membership is supported by our investment in Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (&#8220;DTCC&#8221;) common stock of $375 thousand as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

As of December 31, 2023, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $41.4 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Additionally, we pledged securities to secure a borrowing capacity of $9.5 billion under the BTFP. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 8&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

Funding 

Our primary source of funding comes from insured retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition&#8221; for additional information on our primary sources of funding. 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances. 

##TABLE_START 102 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held approximately $64.2 billion and $80.7 billion, respectively, of estimated uninsured deposits excluding any intercompany balances. These amounts are primarily comprised of checking and savings deposits. These estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 18% and 24% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our &#8220;Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income&#8221; (FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies. 

Table 30 presents, by contractual maturity, the estimated uninsured portion of total time deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our funding and liquidity management activities factor in the expected maturities of these deposits.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 

We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. 

Our short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, typically consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings decreased by $345 million to $538 million as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 driven by a decrease in repurchase agreements. 

Our long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, increased by $1.5 billion to $49.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances of senior unsecured debt and securitized debt obligations, partially offset by maturities of subordinated debt. We provide more information on our securitization activity in &#8220;Item 8.

Other Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into other contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our other contractual obligations include lending commitments, leases, purchase obligations and other contractual arrangements. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our total unfunded lending commitments were $441.3 billion and $409.3 billion, respectively, primarily consisting of credit card lines and loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others&#8221; in this Report. 

Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf&#233;s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in aggregate operating lease obligations, of which $241 million will be due in the following 12 months. We provide more information on our lease activity in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Premises, Equipment and Leases.&#8221; 

We have purchase obligations that represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify significant terms. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $789 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligation liabilities. 

We also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations,&#8221; &#8220;Item 8.

##TABLE_START MARKET RISK PROFILE ##TABLE_END

Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: 

&#8226; Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; 

&#8226; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; 

&#8226; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and 

&#8226; Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. 

We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts. 

##TABLE_START 105 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates relative to our baseline interest rate forecast on our projected 12-month net interest income. Net interest income sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: 

&#8226; In addition to our existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions. These assumptions include loan and deposit growth, pricing, plans for projected changes in our funding mix and our securities and cash position from our internal corporate outlook that is used in our financial planning process. 

&#8226; The analysis assumes this forecast of expected future business growth remains unchanged between the baseline rate forecast and rate shock scenarios, including no changes to our interest rate risk management activities like securities and hedging actions. 

&#8226; We incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit re-pricing, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change, and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. 

&#8226; In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0.00%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0.00%. 

At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. Our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks is largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2022, as our asset mix shift toward credit card and interest-bearing cash balances, which reprice rapidly, was offset by an increase in deposit beta, which was driven by higher interest rates and mix shift toward higher rate deposit products. In the contexts used in this section, &#8220;beta&#8221; refers to the change in deposit rate paid relative to the federal funds rate. 

As part of our ongoing evaluation of our interest rate risk modeling capabilities, we enhanced our mortgage prepayment model in the fourth quarter of 2023 to improve how we estimate the expected prepayment behavior across various interest rate scenarios. This enhancement had the effect of slowing down the forecasted prepayment speed when the underlying mortgage coupons on our existing mortgage securities are well below prevailing (market) mortgage rates, which resulted in slightly lower net interest income sensitivity as of December 31, 2023.

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Economic value of equity sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: 

&#8226; The analysis includes only existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. 

&#8226; Similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure, we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. 

&#8226; Balance attrition assumptions for loans, including credit card, auto and commercial loans, remain unchanged between the baseline interest rate forecast and interest rate shock scenarios as those loans are mainly floating rate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and hence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the level of interest rates. 

&#8226; For assets and liabilities with embedded optionality, such as mortgage securities and deposit balances, we utilize monte carlo simulations to assess economic value with industry-standard term structure modeling of interest rates. 

&#8226; Our calculations of net present value apply appropriate spreads over the benchmark yield curve for select assets and liabilities to capture the inherent risks (including credit risk) to discount expected interest and principal cash flows. 

&#8226; In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0.00%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0.00%. 

Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios. The decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities. The pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity became more negative in higher interest rate scenarios and more positive in lower interest rate scenarios as compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in deposit beta driven by higher interest rates and mix shift towards higher rate deposit products, and a modeling change for our mortgage security prepayments forecast. As described above for net interest income sensitivity, the mortgage prepayment modeling change slowed down the prepayment speed forecast and increased the duration of the mortgage securities on our balance sheet, which resulted in a modestly more negative economic value of equity sensitivity in higher rate scenarios as of December 31, 2023.

In addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as larger rate shocks, higher than +/- 200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. We also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions, such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing. 

Limitations of Market Risk Measures 

The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. 

There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.

##TABLE_START 108

Foreign Exchange Risk 

Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling (&#8220;GBP&#8221;) and the Canadian dollar (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro (&#8220;EUR&#8221;)-denominated borrowings. 

Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 973 million GBP and 785 million GBP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 1.6 billion CAD and 1.7 billion CAD as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 1.3 billion EUR as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet and capital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We manage our translation risk by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion GBP and 1.9 billion GBP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 2.4 billion CAD and 2.2 billion CAD as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. For more information, see &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 10&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity.&#8221; 

Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives 

We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#8221;
