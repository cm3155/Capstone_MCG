MANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

The management of Capital One Financial Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Capital One&#8221;) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company&#8217;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Capital One&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company&#8217;s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company&#8217;s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company&#8217;s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework in &#8220;2013 Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework&#8221; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;), commonly referred to as the &#8220;2013 Framework.&#8221; 

Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established by COSO in the 2013 Framework. Additionally, based upon management&#8217;s assessment, the Company determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. 

The effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited Capital One Financial Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria . 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

Allowance for credit losses &#8211; Credit Card 

Description of the Matter On December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses for the credit card portfolio was $11.7 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses (ACL or allowance) represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of the Company&#8217;s held for investment (HFI) loan portfolios as of the balance sheet date and is comprised of two elements. The first is &#8216;quantitative&#8217; and involves the use of loss forecasting models based upon various statistical analyses with adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions, which includes expected economic conditions. The second is &#8216;qualitative&#8217; and involves factors that represent management&#8217;s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Auditing the allowance for the credit card portfolio was especially challenging and highly judgmental due to the significant judgment required in establishing certain components of the qualitative element. The qualitative element requires management to make significant judgments regarding current and forward-looking conditions, internal and external factors, and uncertainty as it relates to economic, model, or forecast risks, where not already captured in the modeled results. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the ACL process, including, among others, controls over the development, operation, and monitoring of loss forecasting models and management review controls over key assumptions and qualitative judgments used in reviewing the final credit card allowance results. Our tests of controls included observation of certain of management&#8217;s quarterly ACL governance meetings, at which key management judgments, qualitative adjustments, and final ACL results are subjected to critical challenge by management groups independent of the group responsible for producing the ACL estimate. 

Our audit response included involving EY specialists to evaluate the conceptual soundness of the comprehensive framework of the ACL, including certain qualitative elements, in addition to evaluating model methodology, model performance, model governance, and testing key modeling assumptions. We also performed testing on data inputs utilized in the qualitative element calculation, as well as recalculated the qualitative element based on the framework. We evaluated the overall credit card ACL, inclusive of qualitative elements, and whether the recorded ACL appropriately reflects expected credit losses on the portfolio. Additionally, we performed searches for contrary evidence, which included reviewing historical loss statistics, peer bank metrics, and subsequent events and considered whether such information indicated that management&#8217;s judgements were not reasonable or consistently applied. 

Goodwill Impairment Assessment ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 125 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

Description of the Matter 

At December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s goodwill was $15.1 billion recorded across four reporting units, of which $5.1 billion related to the commercial banking reporting unit. As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Management uses a discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. Auditing the annual goodwill impairment test for the commercial banking reporting unit was especially challenging, and highly judgmental due to the estimation uncertainty involved in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value estimate and resulting goodwill impairment determination are impacted by various significant assumptions, including prospective financial information (PFI). These PFI assumptions require management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue and expenses, and credit losses. Management utilizes a financial forecasting process to estimate the PFI and an estimation process to determine the appropriate discount rates. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the Company&#8217;s PFI forecasting process and management&#8217;s goodwill impairment assessment process, including controls over the determination of significant assumptions. 

To test management&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment assessment for the commercial banking reporting unit, we evaluated certain of management&#8217;s PFI assumptions with historical performance (e.g., trend analysis), current industry and economic trends, changes in the Company&#8217;s strategies, and the customer base or product mix. We also evaluated the consistency of the PFI by comparing the projections to other analyses used within the organization and inquiries performed of senior management regarding strategic plans for the reporting unit. We compared prior year forecasts to current year actual performance, as well as fourth quarter 2023 forecasts to actual fourth quarter 2023 results. We performed sensitivity analyses related to the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from changes in the assumptions. 

Our audit response also included involving EY valuation specialists who assisted in assessing the Company&#8217;s DCF methodology, testing of the significant assumptions, developing an independent estimate of the fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit and comparing the result to the Company&#8217;s fair value estimate, and evaluating the total fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting units through comparison to the Company&#8217;s market capitalization and analysis of the resulting control premium to applicable market transactions.

##TABLE_START NOTE 1&#8212;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ##TABLE_END

The Company 

Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Capital One&#8221;) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf&#233;s and other distribution channels. 

As of December 31, 2023, Capital One Financial Corporation&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association (&#8220;CONA&#8221;). On October 1, 2022, the Company complet ed the merger of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (&#8220;COBNA&#8221;), with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity (the &#8220;Bank Merger&#8221;). 

The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our.&#8221; References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from and after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and COBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger. 

We also offer products outside of the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (&#8220;COEP&#8221;), an indirect subsidiary of CONA organized and located in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), and through a branch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our Canadian branch of CONA have the authority to provide credit card loans. 

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of any recent material acquisitions into our business segments, and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in &#8220;Note 17&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#8221; 

Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (&#8220;VOE&#8221;) or a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Voting Interest Entities 

VOEs are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity&#8217;s operations. Since a controlling financial interest in an entity is typically obtained through ownership of a majority voting interest, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights. 

Investments in which we do not hold a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over the entity&#8217;s financial and operating decisions are accounted for under the equity method. If we do not have significant influence, we measure equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income, except those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a measurement alternative is applied). We report equity investments in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and include our share of income or loss and dividends from those investments in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of other investments included in other assets, excluding tax advantage investments, totaled $ 1.0 billion and $ 901 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which primarily included equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method and equity method investments. The 

##TABLE_START 133 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

carrying value of equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method totaled $ 669 million and $ 583 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Variable Interest Entities 

VIEs are entities that, by design, either (i) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (ii) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity&#8217;s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The entity that is deemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. An entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if that entity has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the VIE, such as our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities; our economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE; the design of the VIE, including the capitalization structure, subordination of interests, payment priority, relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE&#8217;s capital structure and the reasons why the interests are held by us. 

We perform on-going reassessments to evaluate whether changes in an entity&#8217;s capital structure or changes in the nature of our involvement with the entity result in a change to the VIE designation or a change to our consolidation conclusion. See &#8220;Note 5&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations&#8221; for further details. 

Balance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

Derivative contracts that we execute bilaterally in the over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) market or are centrally cleared are generally governed by enforceable master netting agreements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under master netting agreements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting agreements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting agreements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. See &#8220;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; for more details. 

We also elect to present securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements on a net basis when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and other applicable criteria are met. Security collateral received from or pledged to the counterparties are not eligible for netting and are presented gross in our consolidated balance sheet. See &#8220;Note 8&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings&#8221; and &#8220;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; for more details. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, all of which, if applicable, have stated maturities of three months or less when acquired. 

Securities Resale and Repurchase Agreements 

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, principally U.S. government and agency obligations, are not accounted for as sales but as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. We continually monitor the market value of these securities and deliver additional collateral to or obtain additional collateral from counterparties, as appropriate. See &#8220;Note 8&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

##TABLE_START 134

Investment Securities 

Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (&#8220;Agency&#8221;) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;); and other securities. The accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities differs depending on the security classification. 

We classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management&#8217;s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. We did not have any securities that were classified as held to maturity as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

We report securities available for sale on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The amortized cost of investment securities reflects the amount for which the security was acquired, adjusted for accrued interest, amortization of premiums, discounts, and net deferred fees and costs, any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, collection of cash, and charge-offs. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;). Unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments for available for sale securities are generally recognized in interest income over the contractual lives of the securities using the interest method. However, premiums on certain callable investment securities are amortized to the earliest call date. We record purchases and sales of investment securities available for sale on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses from the sale of debt securities are computed using the first-in first-out method of identification, and are included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. We elect to present accrued interest for securities available for sale within interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. 

An individual debt security is impaired when the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost. If we intend to sell an available for sale security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses is reversed through our provision for credit losses and the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of income. 

For impaired debt securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. The allowance for credit losses on our investment securities is recognized through our provision for credit losses and limited by the unrealized losses of a security measured as the difference between the security&#8217;s amortized cost and fair value. See further discussion below under the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses - Available for Sale Investment Securities&#8221; section of this Note. 

We charge off any portion of an investment security that we determine is uncollectible. The amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, is charged off through the allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest is charged off as a reduction to interest income. Recoveries of previously charged off principal amounts are recognized in our provision for credit losses when received. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Available for Sale Investment Securities 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses that represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our investment securities classified as available for sale. When an investment security available for sale is impaired due to credit factors, we recognize that impairment through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and correspondingly establish an allowance for credit losses on our consolidated balance sheets. Credit losses recognized in the allowance for credit losses are limited to the amount by which the investment security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. Investment securities in unrealized gain positions do not have any allowance for credit losses as the investment security could be sold at its fair value to prevent realization of any credit losses. We exclude accrued interest from the fair value and amortized cost basis of an investment security for purposes of measuring impairment. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts of investment securities are deducted from the allowance for credit losses. 

For certain of our securities available for sale, we have determined that there is no risk of impairment due to credit factors. These investment securities include high quality debt instruments that are issued and guaranteed by the United States government and its agencies, certain government-sponsored enterprises, and certain foreign sovereign governments or 

##TABLE_START 135 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

supranational organizations. Management performs periodic assessments to reevaluate this conclusion by considering any changes in historical losses, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

We evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at the individual security level and determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value is due to a credit loss. We make this determination through the use of quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our qualitative analysis includes factors such as the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes in the security&#8217;s credit rating, past defaults or delayed payments, and adverse conditions impacting the security or issuer. A credit loss exists to the extent that management does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis. 

For investment securities which require further assessment, we perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow methodology and compare the present value of expected future cash flows to the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis. Projected future cash flows reflect management&#8217;s best estimate and are based on our understanding of past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and are discounted by the security&#8217;s effective interest rate adjusted for prepayments. The allowance for credit losses for investment securities reflects the difference by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of future cash flows and is limited to the amount by which the security&#8217;s amortized cost exceeds its fair value. See &#8220;Note 2&#8212;Investment Securities&#8221; for additional information. 

Loans 

Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated securitization trusts, and loans held for sale and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate loans as well as commercial and industrial loans. 

Loan Classification 

We classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management&#8217;s intent and ability with regard to the loans, which may change over time. The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification, whether we elect the fair value option, whether the loans are originated or purchased and whether purchased loans are considered to have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows is based on management&#8217;s intent at acquisition or origination. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to hold for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to sell are included in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Loans Held for Investment 

Loans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with consolidated securitization transactions are classified as held for investment. Loans classified as held for investment, except for credit card loans, are reported at their amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest. For these loans, we elect to present accrued interest within interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans classified as held for investment, earned finance charges and fees are included in either loans held for investment (if they have been billed to the customer) or interest receivable (if they have not yet been billed to the customer). 

Interest income is recognized on performing loans on an accrual basis. We defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans, premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees. We recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and/or commitment period using the interest method. For credit card loans, loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12 -month period. The amortized cost of loans held for investment is subject to our allowance for credit losses methodology described below under the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment&#8221; section of this Note. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Multifamily commercial real estate loans originated with the intent to sell to government-sponsored enterprises 

##TABLE_START 136 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

are accounted for under the fair value option. We elect the fair value option on these loans as part of our management of interest rate risk along with the corresponding forward sale commitments. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred and are reported in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is calculated based on the loan's stated rate of interest and is reported in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. 

All other loans classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs and any discounts and premiums are deferred until the loan is sold and are then recognized as part of the total gain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans held for sale is generally determined on an aggregate portfolio basis for each loan type, however, fair value may be determined on an individual basis when circumstances warrant. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. 

If a loan is transferred from held for investment to held for sale, then on the transfer date, any decline in fair value related to credit is recorded as a charge-off and any remaining allowance for credit losses is reversed through our provision for credit losses. The loan is then reclassified to held for sale at its amortized cost at the date of the transfer. A valuation allowance is established, if needed, such that the loan held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we report write-downs or recoveries in fair value up to the carrying value at the date of transfer and realized gains or losses on loans held for sale in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest income. We calculate the gain or loss on loan sales as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold, net of the fair value of any interests retained. 

Loans Acquired 

All purchased loans, including loans transferred in a business combination, are initially recorded at fair value, which includes consideration of expected future losses, as of the date of the acquisition. To determine the fair value of loans at acquisition, we estimate discounted contractual cash flows due using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. In determining fair value, contractual cash flows are adjusted to include prepayment estimates based upon historical payment trends, forecasted default rates and loss severities and other relevant factors. The difference between the fair value and the contractual cash flows is recorded as a loan premium or discount, which may relate to either credit or non-credit factors, at acquisition. 

We account for purchased loans under the accounting guidance for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration when, at the time of purchase, the loans have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. These loans are herein referred to as purchased credit-deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans and require the recognition of an allowance for credit losses at the time of acquisition. 

We recognize an allowance for credit losses on purchased loans that have not experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination at the time of purchase through earnings in a manner that is consistent with originated loans. The policies relating to the allowance for credit losses on loans is described below in the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment&#8221; section of this Note. 

Loan Modifications and Restructurings 

Capital One adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023, and elected the modified retrospective adoption method. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings, and establishes disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. We provide information on modified loans, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in &#8220;Note 3&#8212;Loans.&#8221; 

As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral, if any. Loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, a delay in payment, including payment deferrals or a term extension are reported as a Financial Difficulty Modification (&#8220;FDM&#8221;). As restructurings offered to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically not at market terms, FDMs are generally accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan. See &#8220;Note 3&#8212;Loans&#8221; for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings.

Loan Modifications and Restructurings Prior to Adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 

In periods prior to 2023, a loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty was accounted for and reported as a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). These loan modifications typically include short-term payment deferrals, an extension of the loan term, a reduction in the interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance, or a combination of these modifications. See &#8220;Note 3&#8212;Loans&#8221; for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings. 

Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans 

The entire balance of a loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer&#8217;s billing statement. Delinquency is reported on loans that are 30 or more days past due. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan modifications, delinquency and nonaccrual status are reported in accordance with the revised terms of the loans. We generally place consumer and commercial loans on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured. 

Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans classified as held for sale are excluded from nonperforming classification consideration. 

Our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming, by loan category, are as follows: 

&#8226; C redit card loans: As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;), our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming, as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged off, though any amounts deemed uncollectible are reserved for in our allowance for credit losses. 

&#8226; Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer banking loans as nonperforming when we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured, which is generally when the loan becomes 90 days past due. 

&#8226; Commercial banking loans : We classify commercial banking loans as nonperforming as of the date we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured. 

&#8226; Modified loans and troubled debt restructurings: Modified loans, including TDRs for periods ending on or before December 31, 2022 and FDMs for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, that are current at the time of the restructuring remain in accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the modified loan is classified as nonperforming. 

Interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings. In addition, the amortization of deferred loan fees, costs, premiums and discounts is suspended. Interest and fee income are subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payments. However, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, cash received is generally applied against the principal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful.

Charge-Offs 

We charge off loans when we determine that the loan is uncollectible. The amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, is charged off as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses based on the time frames presented below. Accrued interest on loans other than credit card loans determined to be uncollectible is reversed as a reduction of interest income when the loan is classified as nonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued interest is charged off simultaneously with the charge-off of other components of amortized cost and as a reduction of interest income. When received, recoveries of previously charged off amounts are recorded as an increase to the allowance for credit losses (see the &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment&#8221; section of this Note for information on how we account for expected recoveries). Costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off time frames by loan type are presented below. 

&#8226; Credit card loans : We generally charge off credit card loans in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. We charge off delinquent credit card loans for which revolving privileges have been revoked as part of loan workout when the account becomes 120 days past due. Credit card loans in bankruptcy are generally charged off by the end of the month following 30 days after the receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans of deceased account holders are generally charged off 5 days after receipt of notification. 

&#8226; Consumer banking loans: We generally charge off consumer banking loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral. Our charge-off period for auto loans is 120 days past due. Small business banking loans generally charge off at 120 days past due or based on the date the amortized cost basis is deemed uncollectible. Auto loans that have not been previously charged off where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy and the loan has not been reaffirmed charge off in the period that is 60 days from the bankruptcy notification date, regardless of delinquency status. Auto loans that have not been previously charged off and have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are charged off at the end of the month in which the bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining consumer loans generally are charged off within 40 days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost. Consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off by the end of the month following 60 days of receipt of notification. 

&#8226; Commercial banking loans: We charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the amortized cost basis is uncollectible. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses (&#8220;allowance&#8221;) that represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment. We measure the allowance on a quarterly basis through consideration of past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

We measure current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) over the contractual terms of our loans. The contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for renewals or extensions, except when an extension or renewal arises from a borrower option that is not unconditionally cancellable. 

We aggregate loans sharing similar risk characteristics into pools for purposes of measuring expected credit losses. Pools are reassessed periodically to confirm that all loans within each pool continue to share similar risk characteristics. Expected credit losses for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets are measured individually. 

Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance, with a corresponding reduction to our provision for credit losses. At times expected recoveries may result in a negative allowance. We limit the allowance recovery expectations to amounts previously charged off and expected to be charged off. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts result in a reduction to the allowance and recoveries of previously charged off amounts result in an increase to the allowance. 

##TABLE_START 139

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

When developing an estimate of expected credit losses, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods in considering all available information relevant to assessing collectability. This may include internal information, external information, or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Judgment is applied to the development and duration of reasonable and supportable forecasts used in our estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate expected credit losses over the duration of those forecasts and then revert, on a rational and systematic basis, to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. Expected losses for contractual terms extending beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods are based on those historical losses. 

Management will consider and may qualitatively adjust for conditions, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in modeled results. These adjustments are referred to as qualitative factors and represent management&#8217;s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Management&#8217;s judgment may involve an assessment of current and forward-looking conditions including but not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures, nature and volume of the portfolio, external factors, and uncertainty as it relates to economic, model or forecast risks, where not already captured in the modeled results. 

Expected credit losses for collateral-dependent loans are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. When we intend to liquidate the collateral, the fair value of the collateral is adjusted for expected costs to sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-dependent loan when (i) we determine foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or repossession is not probable, but the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The allowance for a collateral-dependent loan reflects the difference between the loan&#8217;s amortized cost basis and the fair value (less selling costs, where applicable) of the loan&#8217;s underlying collateral. 

Our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan portfolio is divided into two primary portfolio segments: auto loans and retail banking loans. We assess our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios based on common risk characteristics, such as origination year, contract type, interest rate, borrower credit score and geography. The commercial banking loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans. These loans are subject to reviews that result in internal risk ratings. In assessing the risk rating of a particular commercial banking loan, among the factors we consider are the financial condition of the borrower, geography, collateral performance, historical loss experience and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant in determining and measuring expected credit losses. Subjective assessment and interpretation are involved. Emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned to that commercial banking loan. 

For consumer banking and commercial banking loans, the contractual period typically does not include renewals or extensions because the renewals and extensions are generally not at the borrower&#8217;s exclusive option to exercise. The undrawn credit exposure associated with our credit card loans is unconditionally cancellable. For this reason, expected credit losses are measured based only on the drawn balance at each quarterly measurement date and not on the undrawn exposure. Because credit card loans do not have a defined contractual life, management estimates both the volume and application of payments to determine a contractual life of the drawn balance at the measurement date over which expected credit losses are developed for credit card loans. 

For consumer banking and commercial banking loans, we have made a policy election to not measure an allowance on accrued interest for loans held for investment because we reverse uncollectible accrued interest in a timely manner. See the &#8220;Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans&#8221; and &#8220;Charge-Offs - Loans&#8221; sections of this Note for information on what we consider timely. For credit card loans, we do not make this election, and we reserve for uncollectible accrued interest relating to credit card loans in the allowance.

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The allowance related to credit card and consumer banking loans assessed on a pooled basis is based on a modeled calculation, which is supplemented by management judgment as described above. Because of the homogeneous nature of our consumer loan portfolios, the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluations. The allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of historical losses in each pool based upon various statistical analyses, with adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions, which includes expected economic conditions. Loss forecast models are utilized to estimate expected credit losses and consider several portfolio indicators including, but not limited to, expected economic conditions, historical loss experience, account seasoning, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, estimated foreclosures or defaults based on observable trends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, unemployment, borrower credit scores and general business trends. Management also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements, general economic conditions and business trends, and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance. 

The allowance related to commercial banking loans assessed on a pooled basis is based on our historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio, which is supplemented by management judgment as described above. These are adjusted for current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels. We apply internal risk ratings to commercial banking loans, which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default (&#8220;default rate&#8221;) and loss given default (&#8220;loss severity&#8221;). Management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including general economic conditions, industry-specific and geographic trends, portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators, and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates. 

The allowance related to smaller-balance homogeneous credit card and consumer banking loans whose terms have been modified is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels for the respective class of assets. The allowance related to consumer banking loans that are assessed at a loan-level is determined based on key considerations that include the borrower&#8217;s overall financial condition, resources and payment history, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, and when applicable, the estimated realizable value of any collateral. The allowance related to commercial banking loans that are assessed at a loan-level is generally determined in accordance with our policy for estimating expected credit losses for collateral-dependent loans as described above. 

Off-balance sheet credit exposures 

In addition to the allowance, we also measure expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable in our Commercial Banking business. This reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment and is recorded within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. These commitments are segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale, which we use to assess credit quality and derive an expected credit loss estimate. We assess these risk classifications, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels, and utilization assumptions to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Expected credit losses are not measured on unfunded lending commitments that are unconditionally cancellable, including all of our unfunded credit card and consumer banking lending commitments and certain of our unfunded commercial banking lending commitments. 

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods. See &#8220;Note 4&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments&#8221; for additional information.

Securitization of Loans 

Our loan securitization activities primarily involve the securitization of credit card and auto loans, which provides a source of funding for us. Loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to a trust. The trust then sells undivided interests in the pool of loan receivables to third-party investors through the issuance of debt securities and transfers the proceeds from the debt issuance to us as consideration for the loan receivables transferred. The debt securities are collateralized by the loan receivables transferred from our portfolio. We remove loans from our consolidated balance sheets if securitizations qualify as sales to unconsolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained and liabilities assumed at fair value and record a gain or loss on the transferred loans. Alternatively, if the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing, the assets will remain on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received. See &#8220;Note 5&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations&#8221; for additional details. 

Premises, Equipment and Leases 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is carried at cost. We capitalize direct costs incurred during the application development stage of internally developed software projects. Depreciation and amortization expenses are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for premises and equipment are generally estimated as follows: 

##TABLE_START Premises and Equipment Useful Lives Buildings and improvements 5 - 39 years 

Furniture and equipment 3 - 10 years 

Computer software 3 years 

Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term ##TABLE_END

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and gains or losses upon disposition are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as realized. See &#8220;Note 7&#8212;Premises, Equipment and Leases&#8221; for additional information. 

Leases 

Lease classification is determined at inception for all lease transactions with an initial term greater than one year. Operating leases are included as right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets within other assets, and operating lease liabilities are classified as other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment, and other borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Lease expense for minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See &#8220;Note 7&#8212;Premises, Equipment and Leases&#8221; for additional information. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and is assigned to one or more reporting units at acquisition. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business unit that is one level below an operating segment. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance, Other Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if adverse circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These indicators could include a sustained, significant decline in the Company&#8217;s stock price, a decline in expected future cash flows, significant disposition activity, a significant adverse change in the economic or business environment, and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group, among others. 

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See &#8220;Note 6&#8212;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional information. 

##TABLE_START 142 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

Mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. Commercial MSRs are subsequently accounted for under the amortization method. We evaluate for impairment as of each reporting date and recognize any impairment in other non-interest income. See &#8220;Note 6&#8212;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional information. 

Foreclosed Property and Repossessed Assets 

Foreclosed property and repossessed assets obtained through our lending activities typically include commercial real estate or personal property, such as automobiles, and are recorded at net realizable value. For foreclosed property and repossessed assets, we generally reclassify the loan to repossessed assets upon repossession of the property in satisfaction of the loan. Net realizable value is the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs and is based on appraisals, when available. Subsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed property and repossessed assets are recorded at the lower of our initial cost basis or net realizable value, which is routinely monitored and updated. Any changes in net realizable value and gains or losses realized from disposition of the property are recorded in other non-interest expense. See &#8220;Note 16&#8212;Fair Value Measurement&#8221; for details. 

Restricted Equity Investments 

We have investments in Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) stock and in Federal Reserve Bank stock. These investments, which are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are not marketable, are carried at cost, and are reviewed for impairment if there is any indicator of impairment. 

Litigation 

We establish reserves for litigation-related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Professional service costs, including fees for attorneys and experts, expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as services are provided. See &#8220;Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others&#8221; for additional information. 

Customer Rewards Reserve 

We offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of reward that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. When rewards are earned by a customer, rewards expense is generally recorded as an offset to interchange income, with a corresponding increase to the customer rewards reserve. The customer rewards reserve is computed based on the estimated future cost of earned rewards that are expected to be redeemed and is reduced as rewards are redeemed. In estimating the customer rewards reserve, we consider historical redemption and spending behavior, as well as the terms and conditions of the current rewards programs, among other factors. Our customer rewards reserve assumes the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. 

Revenue Recognition 

Interest Income and Fees 

Interest income and fees on loans and investment securities are recognized based on the contractual provisions of the underlying arrangements. 

Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, premiums and discounts on loans held for investment are deferred and generally amortized into interest income as yield adjustments over the contractual life and/or commitment period using the interest method. Costs deferred include, among other things, incentives paid to our network of auto dealers for loan referrals. In certain circumstances, we elect to factor prepayment estimates into the calculation of the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method. Prepayment estimates are based on historical prepayment data, existing and forecasted interest rates, 

##TABLE_START 143 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

and economic data. For credit card loans, loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12 -month period. 

The unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments on investment securities are included as components of the investment securities&#8217; carrying value and are generally recognized in interest income as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of the securities using the interest method. However, premiums for certain callable investment securities are amortized to the earliest call date. 

Finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned and presented on our consolidated balance sheets within either loan receivables (if they have been billed to the customer) or interest receivable (if they have not yet been billed to the customer). Annual membership fees are classified as service charges and other customer-related fees in our consolidated statements of income and are deferred and amortized into income over 12 months on a straight-line basis. 

Interchange Income 

Interchange income generally represents fees for standing ready to authorize and providing settlement on credit and debit card transactions processed through the MasterCard&#174; (&#8220;MasterCard&#8221;) and Visa&#174; (&#8220;Visa&#8221;) interchange networks. The levels and structure of interchange rates set by MasterCard and Visa can vary based on cardholder purchase volumes, among other factors. We recognize interchange income upon settlement. See &#8220;Note 17&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; for additional details. 

Card Partnership Agreements 

We have contractual agreements with certain retailers and other partners to provide lending and other services to a mutual customer base. We primarily issue private-label and cobrand credit card loans to these customers over the terms of the partnership agreements. 

Certain partners assist in or perform marketing activities on our behalf and promote our products and services to their customers. As compensation for providing these services, we often pay royalties, bounties or other special bonuses to these partners. Our payments to partners are generally recorded as reductions of revenue or as marketing expenses, depending on their nature. Our credit card partnership agreements may also provide for profit or revenue sharing payments which are presented as a reduction of the related revenue line item(s) when owed to the partner. 

When a partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership, we evaluate the contractual provisions for the loss share payments as well as applicable accounting guidance to determine whether to present the sharing of losses on a gross or net basis in our consolidated financial statements. When loss sharing amounts due from partners are presented on a net basis, they are recorded as a reduction to our provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and reduce the charge-off amounts that we report. The allowance for credit losses attributable to these portfolios is also reduced by the expected reimbursements from these partners for loss sharing amounts. See &#8220;Note 4&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments&#8221; for additional information related to our loss sharing arrangements. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We are authorized to issue stock&#8211;based compensation to employees and directors in various forms, primarily as restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and performance share units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;). In addition, we also issue cash-settled RSUs which are not counted against the common shares reserved for issuance or available for issuance because they are settled in cash. 

For awards settled in shares, we generally recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the award&#8217;s requisite service period based on the fair value of the award at the grant date. If an award settled in shares contains a performance condition with graded vesting, we recognize compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method. Restricted stock units that are cash-settled are accounted for as liability awards which results in quarterly expense fluctuations based on changes in our stock price through the date that the awards are settled. Awards to participants that are eligible for retirement or become eligible during the vesting period are expensed immediately or over the time period between the grant date and when the participant becomes retirement eligible, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in salaries and associate benefits in the consolidated statements of income. 

##TABLE_START 144 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For RSUs and PSUs, the fair value of stock-based compensation used in determining compensation expense will generally equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Certain share-settled awards have discretionary vesting conditions which result in the remeasurement of these awards at fair value each reporting period and the potential for compensation expense to fluctuate with changes in our stock price. See &#8220;Note 13&#8212;Stock-Based Compensation Plans&#8221; for additional details. 

Marketing Expenses 

Marketing expense includes the cost of our various promotional efforts to attract and retain customers such as advertising, promotional materials, and certain customer incentives, including spend-based bonuses. We expense marketing costs as incurred. 

Income Taxes 

We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions, as well as tax-related interest and penalties. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We record the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates or laws as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the change is enacted. We release income tax effects stranded in AOCI when an entire portfolio of the type of item is sold, terminated or extinguished. Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. See &#8220;Note 15&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; for additional details . 

Earnings Per Share 

Earnings per share is calculated and reported under the &#8220;two-class&#8221; method. The &#8220;two-class&#8221; method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. We have unvested share-based payment awards which have a right to receive non-forfeitable dividends and are therefore deemed to be participating securities. 

We calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income, after deducting dividends on preferred stock and participating securities as well as undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period, net of any treasury shares. We calculate diluted earnings per share in a similar manner after consideration of the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents include stock options, RSUs and PSUs. Common stock equivalents are calculated based upon the treasury stock method using an average market price of common shares during the period. Dilution is not considered when a net loss is reported. Common stock equivalents that have an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. See &#8220;Note 12&#8212;Earnings Per Common Share&#8221; for additional details. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

All derivative financial instruments, whether designated in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship or not, are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. See &#8220;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; for additional details.

Fair Value 

Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. See &#8220;Note 16&#8212;Fair Value Measurement&#8221; for additional information. 

Accounting for Acquisitions 

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Likewise, if the fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the acquisition price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized and recorded in other non-interest income. 

If the acquired set of activities and assets do not meet the accounting definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, the assets acquired are recorded at the purchase price plus any transaction costs incurred and no goodwill is recognized.

Accounting Standards Adopted During the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 

##TABLE_START Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statement Impacts Modified Borrowings Experiencing Financial Difficulty and Vintage Disclosures 

ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

Issued March 2022 

Eliminates accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) by creditors, and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. 

Requires an entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. 

We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2023 using a modified retrospective adoption method, which results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption and prospective application of the enhanced disclosure requirements. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See &#8220;Note 3&#8212;Loans&#8221; and &#8220;Note 4&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments&#8221; for additional disclosures. ##TABLE_END

Credit Quality Indicators 

We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. We discuss these risks and our credit quality indicator for each portfolio segment below. 

Credit Card 

Our credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) growth rate, as well as consumers&#8217; financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time. 

The table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Consumer Banking 

Our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends as well as consumers&#8217; financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we consider when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio. 

The table below presents our consumer banking portfolio of loans held for investment by credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We present our auto loan portfolio by Fair Isaac Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) scores at origination and our retail banking loan portfolio by delinquency status, which includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.

Commercial Banking 

The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower&#8217;s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows: 

&#8226; Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as &#8220;pass&#8221; loans. 

&#8226; Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date. 

&#8226; Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status. 

We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for credit losses. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due. 

The following table presents our commercial banking portfolio of loans held for investment by internal risk ratings as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The internal risk rating status includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.

Financial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers 

As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. 

We consider the impact of all loan modifications when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. 

On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures using the modified retrospective adoption method. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The types of modifications we offer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty did not change as a result of ASU 2022-02. Under this new accounting guidance, FDMs are accumulated and the performance of each loan that received a FDM is reported on a rolling twelve month basis. For the reporting period ended December 31, 2023, FDMs and the related borrower performance information pertain to FDMs which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2023. For additional information on FDMs, see &#8220;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; 

For the reporting periods prior to adoption of ASU 2022-02, our previous TDR disclosures are included below in the &#8220;Troubled Debt Restructurings&#8221; section. For additional information on loan modifications classified as a TDR prior to January 1, 2023, see &#8220;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; FDM disclosures are not directly comparable to the prior period TDR disclosures due to differences in the respective accounting guidance and disclosure requirements.

Subsequent Defaults of Financial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers 

FDMs may subsequently enter default. A default occurs if a FDM is either 90 days or more delinquent, has been charged off, or has been reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status. Loans that entered a modification program in any stage of delinquency are included in the aging table above. Loans that entered a modification program while in default are not considered to have subsequently defaulted for purposes of this disclosure. The allowance for any FDMs that have subsequently defaulted is measured using the same methodology as the allowance for loans held for investment. See &#8220;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for additional information. 

The following table presents FDMs that entered subsequent default for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

We adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023, and elected the modified retrospective adoption method. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs, and establishes disclosure requirements, to be applied prospectively, for loans with FDMs. 

The following tables present the major modification types, amortized cost amounts and financial effects of loans modified in a TDR during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

##TABLE_START NOTE 4&#8212;ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS ##TABLE_END

Our allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. Significant judgment is applied in our estimation of lifetime credit losses. When developing an estimate of expected credit losses, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods in considering all available information relevant to assessing collectability. This may include internal information, external information or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our estimate of expected credit losses includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year and then reverts over a one-year period to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. Management will consider and may qualitatively adjust for conditions, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in modeled results. These adjustments are referred to as qualitative factors and represent management&#8217;s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

For credit card loans, finance charges and fees are charged off simultaneously with the charge-off of other components of amortized cost as a reduction of revenue. Total net revenue was reduced by $ 1.9 billion, $ 946 million and $ 629 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for finance charges and fees charged-off as uncollectible. 

We have unfunded lending commitments in our Commercial Banking business that are not unconditionally cancellable by us and for which we estimate expected credit losses in establishing a reserve. This reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment. We build or release the reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income, and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 

See &#8220;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for further discussion of the methodology and policies for determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

The table below summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

The ASU requires public entities to disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables, with an exception for credit cards as they are revolving in nature. 

We charge off loans when we determine that the loan is uncollectible. The amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, is charged off as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses in accordance with our accounting policies.

Credit Card Partnership Loss Sharing Arrangements 

We have certain credit card partnership agreements that are presented within our consolidated financial statements on a net basis, in which our partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses on the underlying loan portfolio. The expected reimbursements from these partners are netted against our allowance for credit losses. Our methodology for estimating reimbursements is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on our credit card loan receivables. These expected reimbursements result in reductions in net charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. See &#8220;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for further discussion of our credit card partnership agreements.

##TABLE_START NOTE 5&#8212;VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND SECURITIZATIONS ##TABLE_END

In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;). Our primary involvement with VIEs is related to our securitization transactions in which we transfer assets to securitization trusts. We primarily securitize credit card and auto loans, which provide a source of funding for us and enable us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties. 

The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements. 

Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs 

The assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for credit losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for credit losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet the maximum amount of any remaining funding obligations. 

The tables below present a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a significant variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.

(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from previously exited businesses. 

(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of the VIE, which includes the seller&#8217;s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. 

(3) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $ 2.6 billion of assets and $ 989 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 616 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2022. 

(4) Primarily consists of variable interests in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. 

Securitization-Related VIEs 

In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests. 

In our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to government-sponsored enterprises (&#8220;GSEs&#8221;) who may, in turn, securitize them. We retain the related MSR and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either solely invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as our contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements. See &#8220;Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others&#8221; for information about the loss sharing agreements, &#8220;Note 6&#8212;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and &#8220;Note 2&#8212;Investment Securities&#8221; for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See &#8220;Note 3&#8212;Loans&#8221; for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business.

Credit Card Securitizations 

We securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. 

Auto Securitizations 

Similar to our credit card securitizations, we securitize a portion of our auto loans which provides a source of funding for us. Auto securitizations involve the transfer of auto loans to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred loans to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests and continue to service the loans in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. 

Other VIEs 

Affordable Housing Entities 

As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method, where costs of the investment are amortized over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized amortization of $ 682 million and $ 637 million, respectively, and tax credits of $ 721 million and $ 664 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $ 5.5 billion and $ 4.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was $ 2.3 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, and is largely expected to be paid from 2024 to 2027.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $ 5.7 billion and $ 4.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $ 18.6 billion and $ 12.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities 

We hold variable interests in entities (&#8220;Investor Entities&#8221;) that invest in community development entities (&#8220;CDEs&#8221;) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 

Other 

We hold variable interests in other VIEs, including companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We are not required to consolidate these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these VIEs is limited to the investments on our consolidated balance sheets of $ 449 million and $ 337 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.

(1) Primarily represents foreign currency translation adjustments and measurement period adjustments. 

The goodwill impairment test is performed as of October 1 of each year. An impairment of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

The fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology, a form of the income approach. The calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit&#8217;s internal forecast and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using appropriate discount rates, which are largely based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and other intangibles balances. Capital is allocated based on each reporting unit&#8217;s specific regulatory capital requirements, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. Consolidated stockholder&#8217;s equity in excess of the sum of all reporting unit&#8217;s capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs, such as dividends, share buybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is allocated to the reporting units and the Other category and assumed distributed to equity holders in future periods. Our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. The reasonableness of our fair value calculation is assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available.

Intangible Assets 

In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded intangible assets that include PCCR, sponsorship, customer and merchant relationships, partnership, trade names, and other customer contract intangibles. At acquisition, the PCCR intangibles reflect the estimated value of existing credit card holder relationships. There were no impairments of intangible assets in 2023 and 2021. There was a $ 10 million impairment of intangible assets in 2022. 

Intangible assets are typically amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on either an accelerated or straight-line basis.

Leases 

Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf&#233;s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options, and we assess the likelihood of exercising such options. If it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, then we include the impact in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. 

Our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As most of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Total operating lease expense consists of operating lease cost, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease cost, which is recognized based on actual amounts incurred. We also sublease certain premises, and sublease income is included in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.

##TABLE_START NOTE 9&#8212;DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES ##TABLE_END

Use of Derivatives and Accounting for Derivatives 

We regularly enter into derivative transactions to support our overall risk management activities. Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging exposures denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use interest rate and foreign currency swaps to perform these hedging activities, but we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. 

We also offer interest rate, commodity, foreign currency derivatives and other contracts as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We offset the substantial majority of the market risk exposure of our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties. 

See below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them: 

&#8226; Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed rate debt and deposits due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-float interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate investment securities. 

&#8226; Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI. Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps and interest rate floors to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated credit card and commercial loans from floating to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in forecasted future cash flows due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. 

&#8226; Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method. 

&#8226; Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.

Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk 

Counterparty Types 

Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that stems from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract, including making payments due upon maturity of certain derivative instruments. We execute our derivative contracts primarily in OTC markets. We also execute interest rate and commodity futures in the exchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both trades cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses (&#8220;CCPs&#8221;) and uncleared bilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;), the Intercontinental Exchange (&#8220;ICE&#8221;) and the LCH Group (&#8220;LCH&#8221;) are our CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties. 

Counterparty Credit Risk Management 

We manage the counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements, where applicable, and exchanging collateral with our counterparties, typically in the form of cash or high-quality liquid securities. We exchange collateral in two primary forms: variation margin, which mitigates the risk of changes in value due to daily market movements and is exchanged daily, and initial margin, which mitigates the risk of potential future exposure of a derivative and is exchanged at the outset of a transaction and adjusted daily. We exchange variation margin and initial margin on our cleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral derivatives executed after September 1, 2021 and in scope for initial margin, we exchange variation margin and initial margin. 

The amount of collateral exchanged for variation margin is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral and will vary over time as market variables change. The amount of the initial margin exchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation of initial margin exposure, as prescribed by 1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators&#8217; margin rules for uncleared derivatives (&#8220;PR Rules&#8221;) or 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and 2) the fair value of the pledged collateral; it will vary over time as market variables change. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a &#8220;haircut&#8221; to discount the value of the collateral pledged. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The fair value of our derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated collateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3 for our net exposure associated with derivatives. 

The terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures. 

&#8226; CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives with CCPs as part of our regulatory requirements. We also clear exchange-traded instruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures commission merchants (&#8220;FCMs&#8221;) serve as the intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial and variation margin through our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default. Initial margin is required by CCPs as collateral against potential losses on our exchange-traded and cleared derivative contracts and variation margin is exchanged on a daily basis to account for mark-to-market changes in those derivative contracts. For CME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, variation margin cash payments are required to be characterized as settlements. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. 

&#8226; Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with bilateral derivative counterparties, where applicable, to mitigate the risk of default. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty and require the party in a net liability position to post collateral. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of uncleared derivatives exceed established exposure thresholds. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate their derivative contract and close out existing positions.

Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments 

We record counterparty credit valuation adjustments (&#8220;CVAs&#8221;) on our derivative assets to reflect the credit quality of our counterparties. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CVAs, which may be adjusted due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral, and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVAs&#8221;) to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. 

Balance Sheet Presentation 

The following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, and their related gains or losses are included in operating activities as changes in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Balance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are generally governed by enforceable master netting agreements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under master netting agreements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting agreements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting agreements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. 

The following table presents the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, resale and repurchase agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged in accordance with such arrangements. The amount of collateral presented, however, is limited to the amount of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances; therefore, instances of over-collateralization are excluded.

(2) Changes in fair values of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;). The initial value of the excluded component is recognized in earnings over the life of the swap under the amortization approach.

(4) We recognized a loss of $ 66 million and $ 17 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and gain of $ 163 million for year ended December 31, 2021, on foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI. These amounts were largely offset by the foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on our foreign currency denominated intercompany funding included in other non-interest income on our consolidated statements of income . 

In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify into earnings an after-tax loss of $ 712 million recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2023 associated with cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. This amount will largely offset the cash flows associated with the forecasted transactions hedged by these derivatives. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately 9.2 years as of December 31, 2023. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy.

##TABLE_START NOTE 11&#8212;REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY ##TABLE_END

Regulation and Capital Adequacy 

The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), respectively (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and other capital provisions. 

As a bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) capital regulations. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. 

We have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Basel III Finalization Proposal.&#8221; 

The Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) (collectively, &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies&#8221;) adopted a final rule (&#8220;CECL Transition Rule&#8221;) that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital (the &#8220;CECL Transition Election&#8221;). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. 

Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and the cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. 

##TABLE_START Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 

2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 &#8220;Day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25% Phased In 50% Phased In 75% Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of $ 2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we have phased in 50% of this amount as of December 31, 2023. The remaining $ 1.2 billion will be phased in on January 1, 2024 and 2025 at $ 600 million per year. As of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s

Stock Plans 

We have one active stock-based compensation plan available for the issuance of shares to employees and directors. As of December 31, 2023, under the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive plan (&#8220;2004 Plan&#8221;), we are authorized to issue 81 million common shares in various forms, primarily share-settled RSUs, PSUs and non-qualified stock options. Of this amount, approximately 23 million shares remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2023. The 2004 Plan permits the use of newly issued shares or treasury shares upon the settlement of options and stock-based incentive awards, and we generally settle by issuing new shares. 

We also issue cash-settled restricted stock units. These cash-settled units are not counted against the common shares authorized for issuance or available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. Cash-settled units vesting during 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in cash payments to associates of $ 4 million, $ 8 million and $ 7 million, respectively. There was no unrecognized compensation cost for unvested cash-settled units as of December 31, 2023. 

Total stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 513 million, $ 314 million and $ 331 million, respectively. The total income tax benefit for stock-based compensation recognized during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 99 million, $ 75 million and $ 62 million, respectively. 

In addition, we maintain an Associate Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;Purchase Plan&#8221;), which is a compensatory plan under the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation. Related to the Purchase Plan, we recognized compensation expense of $ 39 million, $ 36 million and $ 33 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also maintain a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, which allows participating stockholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock through automatic reinvestment of dividends or optional cash investments. 

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units 

RSUs represent share-settled awards that do not contain performance conditions and are granted to certain employees at no cost to the recipient. RSUs generally vest over three years from the date of grant; however, some RSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the first or third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed, including continued employment for a specified period of time. 

PSUs represent share-settled awards that contain performance conditions and are granted to certain employees at no cost to the recipient. PSUs generally vest over three years from the date of grant; however, some PSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of PSUs that vest over three years can be reduced by 50 % or 100 % depending on whether specific performance goals are met during the vesting period. The number of three-year cliff vesting PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent upon meeting specific performance goals over a three-year period. These PSUs also include an opportunity to receive from 0 % to 150 % of the target number of common shares. 

A recipient of an RSU or PSU is entitled to receive a share of common stock after the applicable restrictions lapse and is generally entitled to receive cash payments or additional shares of common stock equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSU or PSU is outstanding, but is not entitled to voting rights. Generally, the value of RSUs and PSUs will equal the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the expense is recognized over the vesting period. Certain PSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and are remeasured at fair value each reporting period.

Defined Contribution Plan 

We sponsor a contributory Associate Savings Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) in which all full-time and part-time associates over the age of 18 are eligible to participate. We make non-elective contributions to each eligible associate&#8217;s account and match a portion of associate contributions. We also sponsor a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan in which select groups of employees are eligible to participate. We make contributions to this plan based on participants&#8217; deferral of salary, bonuses and other eligible pay. In addition, we match participants&#8217; excess compensation (compensation over the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) compensation limit) less deferrals. We contributed a total of $ 492 million, $ 444 million and $ 378 million to these plans during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 

We sponsor several frozen plans, including a qualified defined benefit pension plan, several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, and a plan that provides other postretirement benefits, including medical and life insurance coverage. Our pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plan are valued using December 31 as the measurement date each year. Our policy is to amortize prior service amounts on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service to full eligibility for benefits of active plan participants. 

The following table sets forth, on an aggregated basis, changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets, the funded status and how the funded status is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.

Net periodic benefit gain for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan totaled $ 6 million, $ 8 million and $ 12 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recognized pre-tax gains of $ 9 million in 2023, pre-tax losses of $ 24 million in 2022 and pre-tax gains of $ 4 million in AOCI for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan in 2021. 

Pre-tax amounts recognized in AOCI that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost consist of net actuarial losses of $ 47 million and $ 57 million for our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and net actuarial gains of $ 2 million and $ 3 million for our other postretirement benefit plan as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was no meaningful prior service cost recognized in AOCI. 

Plan Assets and Fair Value Measurement 

Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities and debt securities are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and enhance our ability to achieve our benchmark for long-term investment return. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on careful consideration of plan liabilities, the plan&#8217;s funded status and our financial condition. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on a daily basis. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our plan assets totaled $ 241 million and $ 227 million, respectively. We invested substantially all our plan assets in common collective trusts, which primarily consist of domestic and international equity securities, government securities and corporate and municipal bonds. Our plan assets were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. For information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, see &#8220;Note 16&#8212;Fair Value Measurement.&#8221;

We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions, as well as tax-related interest and penalties. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We record the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates or laws as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the change is enacted. We release income tax effects stranded in AOCI when an entire portfolio of the type of item is sold, terminated or extinguished. Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. 

The following table presents significant components of the provision for income taxes attributable to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

We are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in certain countries and states in which we operate. The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. During 2023, we continued to participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (&#8220;CAP&#8221;) for our open federal income tax return years and have been accepted into CAP for 2024. During 2023, the IRS continued examining our 2021 federal income tax return for only two issues listed for review post-filing that we expect to be completed by June 30, 2024. We also expect that the IRS review of our 2022 federal income tax return will be completed in 2024. We also expect that the IRS review of our 2023 federal income tax return will be substantially completed in 2024 prior to its filing. 

It is reasonably possible that further adjustments to the Company&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits may be made within 12 months of the reporting date as a result of future judicial or regulatory interpretations of existing tax laws. At this time, an estimate of the potential changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.

##TABLE_START NOTE 16&#8212;FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ##TABLE_END

Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

##TABLE_START Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) methodologies or similar techniques. ##TABLE_END

The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the observable or unobservable inputs to the instruments&#8217; fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The determination of the leveling of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. 

Investment Securities 

We measure the fair value of our U.S. Treasury securities using quoted prices in active markets. For the majority of securities in other investment categories, we utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value measurements. We use a waterfall of pricing vendors determined using our annual assessment of pricing service performance. A pricing service may be considered as the preferred or primary pricing provider depending on how closely aligned its prices are to other vendor prices, and how consistent the prices are with other available market information. The price of each security is confirmed by comparing such price to other vendor prices before it is finalized. 

RMBS and CMBS are generally classified as Level 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are not consistently observable, fair values are derived using the best available data. Such data may include quotes provided by dealers, valuation from external pricing services, independent pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques, for example, calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings and losses. Generally, the external pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available. Pricing models may be used, which can vary by asset class, and may also incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Across asset classes, information such as trader/dealer inputs, credit spreads, forward curves and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing models may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves, grouping securities based on their characteristics and using matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment assumptions. 

##TABLE_START 202 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

We validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including other pricing services, dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed. Additionally, on an on-going basis, we request more detailed information from the valuation vendors to understand the pricing methodology and assumptions used to value the securities. 

Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

We use both exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to manage our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risk exposures. When quoted market prices are available and used to value our exchange-traded derivatives, we classify them as Level 1. However, the majority of our derivatives do not have readily available quoted market prices. Therefore, we value most of our derivatives using vendor-based models. We primarily rely on market observable inputs for these models, including, for example, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates. These inputs can vary depending on the type of derivatives and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is based. We typically classify derivatives as Level 2 when significant inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model itself does not require significant judgment. When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves, such derivatives are classified as Level 3. We consider the impact of credit risk valuation adjustments when measuring the fair value of derivative contracts in order to reflect the credit quality of the counterparty and our own credit quality. Our internal pricing is compared against additional pricing sources such as external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated. These derivatives are included in other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Loans Held for Sale 

In our commercial business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to GSEs. We elect the fair value option for such loans as part of our management of interest rate risk in our multifamily agency business. These held for sale loans are valued based on market observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. 

Retained Interests in Securitizations 

We have retained interests in various mortgage securitizations from previous acquisitions. Our retained interests primarily include interest-only bonds and negative amortization bonds. We record these retained interests at fair value using market indications and valuation models to calculate the present value of future cash flows. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs such as prepayment and discount rate assumptions, retained interests in securitizations are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. 

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets 

We offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan to eligible associates. In addition to participant deferrals, we make contributions to the plan. Participants invest these contributions in a variety of publicly traded mutual funds. The plan assets, which consist of those publicly traded mutual funds, are classified as Level 1.

Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward 

The table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Generally, transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions in the pricing of these financial instruments as evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors and transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information as evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple pricing sources.

Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs 

Generally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity or credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads, and would lead to a decrease in the fair value measurement. 

Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measureme nts 

The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.

(1) Weighted averages are calculated by using the product of the input multiplied by the relative fair value of the instruments. 

(2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

We are required to measure and recognize certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

Net Loans Held for Investment 

Loans held for investment that are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets on a nonrecurring basis largely consist of impaired loans for which impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value is determined using appraisal values that are obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information, adjusted for the estimated cost to sell. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, these 

##TABLE_START 207 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

loans are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for individually impaired collateralized loans held for investment are recorded in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale for which we have not elected the fair value option are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred fees and deferred origination costs, or fair value. These loans held for sale are valued based on market observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2. Fair value adjustments to these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. 

Other Assets 

Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, other repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale. The assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value, listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated costs to sell. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for these assets are recorded in other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. 

The following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the year then ended.

In the above table, loans held for investment are generally valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0 % to 100 %, with a weighted average of 18 %, a nd fro m 0 % to 43 %, with a weighted average of 20 %, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The weighted average non-recoverable rate is calculated based on the estimated market value of the underlying collateral. The significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information related to fair value of the other assets are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.

##TABLE_START NOTE 17&#8212;BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ##TABLE_END

Our principal operations are organized into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. 

&#8226; Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in the United Kingdom and Canada. 

&#8226; Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. 

&#8226; Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $ 20 million and $ 2 billion. 

&#8226; Other category: Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and oversight of our funds transfer pricing process, to our business segments. Accordingly, net gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities are included in the Other category. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges, as well as residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments. 

Basis of Presentation 

We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. 

Business Segment Reporting Methodology 

The results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate market rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. 

The following is additional information on the principles and methodologies used in preparing our business segment results. 

&#8226; Net interest income: Interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense from deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities are reflected within each applicable business segment. Because funding and asset/liability management are managed centrally by our Corporate Treasury group, net interest income for our business segments also 

##TABLE_START 211 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that is intended to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities, respectively, using a matched funding concept. The taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products is also allocated to each business unit with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. 

&#8226; Non-interest income: Non-interest fees and other revenue associated with loans or customers managed by each business segment and other direct revenues are accounted for within each business segment. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses: The provision for credit losses is directly attributable to the business segment in accordance with the loans each business segment manages. 

&#8226; Non-interest expense: Non-interest expenses directly managed and incurred by a business segment are accounted for within each business segment. We allocate certain non-interest expenses indirectly incurred by business segments, such as corporate support functions, to each business segment based on various factors, including the actual cost of the services from the service providers, the utilization of the services, the number of employees or other relevant factors. 

&#8226; Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to one or more segments at acquisition. Intangible amortization is included in the results of the applicable segment. 

&#8226; Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for each business segment based on a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in the Other category. 

&#8226; Loans held for investment: Loans are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type served by that business segment. 

&#8226; Deposits: Deposits are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type served by that business segment. 

Segment Results and Reconciliation 

We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. The following table presents our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. 

(2) Total net revenue was reduced by $ 1.9 billion, $ 946 million and $ 629 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for credit card finance charges and fees charged off as uncollectible. 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

The majority of our revenue from contracts with customers consists of interchange fees, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other contract revenue. Interchange fees are primarily from our Credit Card business and are recognized upon settlement with the interchange networks, net of rewards earned by customers. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as automated teller machine (&#8220;ATM&#8221;) usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue in our Credit Card business consists primarily of revenue from our partnership arrangements. Other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking business consists primarily of revenue earned on certain marketing and promotional events from our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. 

The following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

##TABLE_START NOTE 18&#8212;COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERS ##TABLE_END

Commitments to Lend 

Our unfunded lending commitments primarily consist of credit card lines, loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. These commitments, other than credit card lines and certain other unconditionally cancellable lines of credit, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. 

For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management&#8217;s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. 

We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the customer. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management&#8217;s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments. 

The following table presents the contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments.

Loss Sharing Agreements 

Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of these originated loans. Beginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on new loss sharing agreements entered into. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. For those loss sharing agreements entered into as of and prior to December 31, 2019, we amortize the liability recorded at inception into non-interest income as we are released from risk of having to make a payment and record our estimate of expected credit losses each period through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for these loss sharing agreements was $ 137 million and $ 82 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See &#8220;Note 4&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments&#8221; for information related to our credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements.

Litigation 

In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. 

For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves, and for other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of December 31, 2023 are approximately $ 200 million. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 

Interchange Litigation 

In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One, seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. The networks and issuing banks entered into settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. 

The lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was bifurcated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement. 

The monetary relief class action settled for $5.5 billion. The settlement received final approval from the district court in December 2019. The Second Circuit affirmed the settlement in March 2023, and it is now final. Some of the merchants that opted out of the monetary relief class have brought cases, and some of those cases have settled and some remain pending. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds the portion of these settlements attributable to Visa-allocated transactions. Any settlement amounts based on MasterCard-allocated transactions that have not already been paid are reflected in our reserves. The claims by the injunctive relief class have not been resolved. 

Cybersecurity Incident 

On July 29, 2019, we announced that on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained unauthorized access to our systems. This individual obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers (the &#8220;2019 Cybersecurity Incident&#8221;). As a result of the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident, we have been subject to numerous legal proceedings and other inquiries and could be the subject of additional proceedings and inquiries in the future. 

Consumer class actions . We are named as a defendant in 5 putative consumer class action cases in Canadian courts alleging harm from the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various remedies, including monetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach of contract, negligence, violations of various privacy laws and a variety of other legal causes of action. In August 2021, a trial court in Ontario dismissed with prejudice one of these putative class actions, and on January 31, 2024, the Court of Appeals of Ontario affirmed the trial court&#8217;s decision. The Plaintiffs have sixty days to seek leave to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada should they seek an appeal. In the second quarter of 2022, a trial court in British Columbia preliminarily certified a class of all impacted Canadian consumers except those in Quebec, which would allow the case to proceed with discovery on a classwide basis. The preliminary certification decision in British Columbia has been appealed. In the third quarter of 2023, a trial court in Quebec preliminarily authorized a class of all impacted consumers in

Quebec. This decision also has been appealed. The final two putative class actions, both of which are pending in Alberta, are continuing in parallel, but remain at a preliminary stage. 

Governmental inquiries. In August 2020, we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC resulting from regulatory reviews of the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and relating to ongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and operational risk management processes. We paid an $ 80 million penalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the OCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement did not contain a monetary penalty. The OCC lifted its consent order on August 31, 2022 and the Federal Reserve lifted its consent order on July 5, 2023. Canada&#8217;s Office of Privacy Commissioner&#8217;s (&#8220;OPC&#8221;) investigation into the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident is still open. 

Walmart Litigation 

On April 7, 2023, Walmart filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the contractual right to early termination of the credit card partnership agreement under which we are the exclusive issuer of Walmart&#8217;s private label and co-branded credit card program in the U.S. and share in certain related economics. On May 2, 2023, Walmart filed an amended complaint in which it also alleges breach of contract and seeks damages caused by any delay in termination. On May 4, 2023, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to Walmart&#8217;s amended complaint, denying that Walmart has any right to terminate the partnership and alleging that Walmart has breached its contractual obligations to Capital One. 

U.K. PPI Litigation 

In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (&#8220;PPI&#8221;). For several years leading up to the claims submission deadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;)), we received customer complaints and regulatory claims relating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved the PPI complaints and regulatory claims received prior to the deadline. Some of the claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process have subsequently initiated legal proceedings, seeking additional redress. We are responding to these proceedings as we receive them. 

Savings Account Litigation 

In July 2023, Capital One was sued in a putative class action in the Eastern District of Virginia by savings account holders alleging breach of contract and a variety of other causes of action relating to Capital One&#8217;s introduction of a new savings account product with a higher interest rate than existing savings account products. On November 9, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In February 2024, Capital One was sued in similar putative class actions in the Central District of California and the Southern District of Ohio alleging breach of contract and other causes of action. Capital One intends to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuits. 

Other Pending and Threatened Litigation 

In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 

Other Contingencies 

Deposit Insurance Assessments 

On November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC will collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;) over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning with the first quarter of 2024 with the first payment due on June 28, 2024. The FDIC may shorten or extend the assessment period based on adjustments to its loss estimates for the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The special assessment base is equal to an insured depository institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits reported on its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income as of December 31, 2022 (&#8220;2022 Call Report&#8221;), adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. We recognized $ 289 million in operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the special assessment based on our 2022 Call Report, which was revised and refiled during 2023.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In the preamble to the final rule, the FDIC announced that it will conduct a review of the reporting methodology for estimated uninsured deposits and related items. It is reasonably possible amendments will be needed to our 2022 Call Report due to legal and regulatory developments, which could result in additional expenses associated with the special assessment that we estimate could be as much as $ 150 million. The ultimate amount of expenses associated with the special assessment will also be impacted by the finalization of the losses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

In the ordinary course of business, we may have loans issued to our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Pursuant to our policy, such loans are issued on the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. 

##TABLE_START NOTE 21&#8212;SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ##TABLE_END

On February 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), by and among Capital One, Discover Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Discover&#8221;) and Vega Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into Discover, with Discover as the surviving entity in the merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;); (b) immediately following the Merger, Discover, as the surviving entity, will merge with and into Capital One, with Capital One as the surviving entity in the second-step merger (the &#8220;Second Step Merger&#8221;); and (c) immediately following the Second Step Merger, Discover Bank, a Delaware-chartered and wholly owned subsidiary of Discover, will merge with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity in the merger (the &#8220;CONA Bank Merger,&#8221; and collectively with the Merger and the Second Step Merger, the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each of Capital One and Discover. 

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Discover outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than certain shares held by Discover or Capital One, will be converted into the right to receive 1.0192 shares of common stock of Capital One. Holders of Discover common stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. At the effective time of the Second Step Merger, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, of Discover, and each share of 6.125 % Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, of Discover, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Step Merger, will be converted into the right to receive a share of newly created series of preferred stock of Capital One having terms that are not materially less favorable than the applicable series of Discover preferred stock. The closing of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the stockholders of each of Capital One and Discover.
