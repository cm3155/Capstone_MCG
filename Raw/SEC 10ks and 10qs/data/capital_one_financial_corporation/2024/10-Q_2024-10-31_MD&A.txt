INTRODUCTION 

Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Capital One&#8221;) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf&#233;s and other distribution channels. 

As of September 30, 2024, Capital One Financial Corporation&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association (&#8220;CONA&#8221;). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our.&#8221; CONA is referred to as the &#8220;Bank.&#8221; 

Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with our deposits, long-term debt and other borrowings. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income, net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. 

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover. 

&#8226; Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) and Canada. 

&#8226; Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. 

&#8226; Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion.

Business Developments 

We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial products and services as well as financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. 

Agreement to Acquire Discover 

On February 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), by and among Capital One, Discover Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Discover&#8221;) and Vega Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into Discover, with Discover as the surviving entity in the merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;); (b) immediately following the Merger, Discover, as the surviving entity, will merge with and into Capital One, with Capital One as the surviving entity in the second-step merger (the &#8220;Second Step Merger&#8221;); and (c) immediately following the Second Step Merger, Discover Bank, a Delaware-chartered and wholly owned subsidiary of Discover, will merge with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity in the merger (the &#8220;CONA Bank Merger,&#8221; and collectively with the Merger and the Second Step Merger, the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each of Capital One and Discover. 

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Discover outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than certain shares held by Discover or Capital One, will be converted into the right to receive 1.0192 shares of common stock of Capital One. Holders of Discover common stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. At the effective time of the Second Step Merger, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, of Discover, and each share of 6.125% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, of Discover, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Step Merger, will be converted into the right to receive a share of newly created series of preferred stock of Capital One having terms that are not materially less favorable than the applicable series of Discover preferred stock. The closing of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the stockholders of each of Capital One and Discover. 

Walmart Program Agreement Termination 

On May 21, 2024, our credit card program agreement with Walmart terminated (&#8220;Walmart Program Termination&#8221;). Pursuant to terms of the termination, Capital One retained ownership and servicing of the existing credit card portfolio of approximately $8.5 billion of loans. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company began converting eligible customers and integrating the accounts into Capital One branded card products, which may result in elevated operational and performance uncertainties as this portfolio converts to branded products. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Final Rule 

On March 5, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) issued a final rule amending Regulation Z that, if it goes into effect as currently issued, would significantly lower the safe harbor amount for past due fees that a large credit card issuer, including the Bank, can charge on consumer credit card accounts. The final rule is currently stayed as a result of ongoing litigation. 

The final rule, if it goes into effect as currently issued, would have a significant impact on our revenue, as well as potentially significant marketplace effects, including effects on competition, pricing, consumer behaviors, volumes, and credit. In response to the final rule, we have developed a number of mitigating actions and some of these mitigating actions have been implemented. Other actions may be implemented as a result of the final rule. 

For more information on risks related to this rule, see the risk factors set forth under &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Financial Highlights 

We reported net income of $1.8 billion ($4.41 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $10.0 billion and net income of $3.7 billion ($8.92 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $28.9 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. In comparison, we reported net income of $1.8 billion ($4.45 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $9.4 billion and net income of $4.2 billion ($10.28 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $27.3 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 

Our common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III standardized approach was 13.6% and 12.9% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See &#8220;Capital Management&#8221; for additional information. 

In the third quarter of 2024, we declared and paid common stock dividends of $233 million and repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock. During the first nine months of 2024, we declared and paid common stock dividends of $705 million and repurchased $403 million of shares of our common stock. See &#8220;Capital Management&#8212;Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases&#8221; for additional information. 

Below are additional highlights of our performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this &#8220;Executive Summary.&#8221; 

Total Company Performance 

&#8226; Earnings: 

Our net income decreased by $13 million to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by: 

&#9702; Higher provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by allowance releases compared to a net allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. 

&#9702; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#9702; Higher net-interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. 

Our net income decreased by $527 million to $3.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by: 

&#9702; Higher provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in Domestic Card, partially offset by a lower net allowance build. 

&#9702; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#9702; Higher net-interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 

&#8226; Loans Held for Investment: 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

&#9702; Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $229 million to $320.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our credit card and auto loan portfolios. 

&#9702; Average loans held for investment increased by $5.5 billion to $318.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by $5.9 billion to $315.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by customer payments outpacing originations in our commercial loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 

&#9702; Our net charge-off rate increased by 71 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;) to 3.27% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 79 bps to 3.32% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in our credit card loan portfolio. 

&#9702; Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 10 bps to 3.89% as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower delinquency inventories in our auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses increased by $1.2 billion to $16.5 billion and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 39 bps to 5.16% as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an allowance build due to the Walmart Program Termination in the second quarter of 2024. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, &#8220;Business Segment Financial Performance.&#8221; This section should be read together with our &#8220;Executive Summary,&#8221; where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees, net of reversals, on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table 2 below presents the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.

Net interest margin (6) 

6.83 &#160; % 6.59% __________ 

(1) Average yield is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period. Annualized interest income does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. Average yield is calculated using whole dollar values for average balances and interest income/expense. 

(2) Past due fees, net of reversals, included in interest income totaled approximately $626 million and $1.7 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $593 million and $1.6 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 , respectively. 

(3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately $20 million and $59 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $18 million and $55 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. 

(4) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

(5) Includes amounts related to entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities of $2.0 billion and $2.0 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Related interest expense was $7 million and $23 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $8 million and $24 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 

(6) The Walmart Program Termination increased net interest margin by 22 bps and 11 bps in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. 

** Not meaningful. 

Net interest income increased by $653 million to $8.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. Net interest income increased by $1.4 billion to $23.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins in our credit card loan portfolio, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 

Net interest margin increased by 42 bps to 7.11% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 24 bps to 6.83% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher asset yields and growth in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 

Our total company cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 62% as of June 30, 2024, prior to the Federal Reserve reducing the target federal funds rate during the third quarter of 2024, which marked the beginning of a new rate cycle.

(1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. 

(2) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. 

(3) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above.

(2) Includes gains of $36 million and $89 million on deferred compensation plan investments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and losses of $13 million and gains of $36 million on deferred compensation plan investments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. These amounts have corresponding offsets in non-interest expense. 

Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest income increased by $253 million to $5.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and higher capital markets activity in our Commercial Banking business. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our provision for credit losses increased by $198 million to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. Our provision for credit losses increased by $1.5 billion to $9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in Domestic Card, partially offset by a lower net allowance build. 

We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within &#8220;Credit Risk Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1.

These amounts have corresponding offsets from investments in other non-interest income. 

Non-interest expense increased by $454 million to $5.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by $798 million to $15.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have incurred $63 million and $94 million of integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover, which are included in Operating Expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $441 million (19.9% effective income tax rate) and $797 million (17.9% effective income tax rate) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to an income tax provision of $432 million (19.4% effective income tax rate) and $932 million (18.2% effective income tax rate) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings. 

We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 15&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased by $8.0 billion to $486.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by increases in our cash and securities available for sale balances, partially offset by an allowance build due to the Walmart Program Termination in the second quarter of 2024. 

Total liabilities increased by $3.1 billion to $423.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by deposit growth due to our national consumer banking strategy, partially offset by net maturities of our securitized debt obligations. Our national consumer banking strategy includes our national brand and marketing strategy, caf&#233;s, and tech / digital investments, which have enabled us to both deepen and grow our overall customer base. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity increased by $4.8 billion to $62.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by net income of $3.7 billion. 

The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first nine months of 2024. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to the timing of normal balance sheet management activities that are intended to support our capital and liquidity positions, our market risk profile and the needs of our customers. 

Investment Securities 

Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (&#8220;GSE&#8221; or &#8220;Agency&#8221;) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in Agency and U.S. Treasury securities represented 96% and 97% of our total investment securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio increased by $4.4 billion to $83.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by net purchases and decreases in relevant benchmark interest rates. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3&#8212;Investment Securities&#8221; for more information.

Loans held for investment decreased by $229 million to $320.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our credit card and auto loan portfolios. 

We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality in &#8220;Credit Risk Profile,&#8221; &#8220;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4&#8212;Loans.&#8221; 

Funding Sources 

Our primary source of funding comes from insured retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. 

Table 7 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Total deposits increased by $5.2 billion to $353.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by our national consumer banking strategy, partially offset by maturities in brokered deposits. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held $62.1 billion and $64.2 billion, respectively, of estimated uninsured deposits. These amounts were primarily comprised of checking and savings depos its. These estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 18% of our total deposits as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our &#8220;Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income&#8221; (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;) 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies, adjusted to exclude certain items not presented within deposits on our consolidated balance sheet, including intercompany balances and cash collateral received on certain derivative contracts . 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Securitized debt obligations decreased by $2.2 billion to $15.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by net maturities and paydowns in our securitization programs. 

Other debt increased by $1.6 billion to $33.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by net issuances of unsecured senior debt.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 6&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1.

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover. 

The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 17&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our &#8220;managed&#8221; presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

We summarize our business segment results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 13&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#8221;

Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include the following: 

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $629 million to $5.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by $1.8 billion to $16.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest income increased by $116 million to $4.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 due to growth in our Credit Card business. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $131 million to $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses increased by $1.6 billion to $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a lower allowance build. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $352 million to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by $657 million to $9.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 

Loans Held for Investment: 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.1 billion to $156.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by growth across our portfolio.

Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate increased by 118 bps to 5.60% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 153 bps to 5.83% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher principal charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 

&#8226; The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 8 bps to 4.54% as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by higher ending loan balances. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)

(1) We recognize finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and charge off any uncollectible amounts. Finance charges and fees charged off as uncollectible are reflected as a reduction in total net revenue. 

(2) Average yield is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period and does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. 

(3) Total net revenue margin is calculated based on annualized total net revenue for the period divided by average loans during the period. 

(4) The Walmart Program Termination increased revenue margin by 51 bps and 21 bps in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

(5) The Walmart Program Termination increased the Domestic Card net charge-off rate by 38 bps and 19 bps in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

(6) The Walmart Program Termination resulted in an allowance for credit losses build in Domestic Card of $826 million in the second quarter of 2024. 

Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by: 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

&#8226; Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#8226; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 

&#8226; Higher provision for credit losses driven by higher net charge-offs, including the impacts of the elimination of loss sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination, partially offset by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. 

Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by: 

&#8226; Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a lower allowance build. 

&#8226; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by growth in our Credit Card business and increased marketing spend. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#8226; Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances and margins, including the impacts of the elimination of revenue sharing provisions due to the Walmart Program Termination. 

Consumer Banking Business 

The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits as well as service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 

Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $403 million and $1.3 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $611 million and $2.0 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively.

Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include the following: 

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $105 million to $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by $698 million to $6.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower margins in our retail banking business, partially offset by higher deposits in our retail banking business. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $40 million to $182 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by $87 million to $513 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher interchange revenue from an increase in debit card purchase volume and revenue earned from auto industry services. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $138 million to $351 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased by $360 million to $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs and a smaller allowance release in our auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and $3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Loans Held for Investment: &#160; 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment increased by $1.3 billion to $76.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Average loans held for investment decreased by $972 million to $76.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased by $2.4 billion to $75.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by the impact of lower auto originations in the second half of 2022 and throughout 2023. 

Deposits: 

&#8226; Period-end deposits increased by $13.4 billion to $309.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by continued growth from our national consumer banking strategy. 

Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: &#160; 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate increased by 30 bps to 2.11% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased by 40 bps to 2.00% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 77 bps to 6.31% as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower auto delinquency inventories. 

Commercial Banking Business 

The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income earned from products and services provided to our clients such as advisory services, capital markets and treasury management. Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses and operating costs. 

Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $263 million and $821 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $214 million and $468 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively.

Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include the following: 

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $25 million to $596 million in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by $97 million to $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower average loan balances. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $292 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest income increased by $87 million to $844 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by our capital markets business. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased by $68 million to $48 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by an allowance release compared to an allowance build in the third quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses decreased by $441 million to $80 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in our office real estate portfolio. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at $495 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and at $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 

Loans Held for Investment: 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $3.7 billion to $86.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations. 

&#8226; Average loans held for investment decreased by $3.5 billion to $88.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by $3.9 billion to $89.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations. 

Deposits: 

&#8226; Period-end deposits decreased by $2.1 billion to $30.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an intentional reduction in lower margin deposit balances. 

Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate remained substantially flat at 0.22% in the third quarter of 2024. The net charge-off rate decreased by 49 bps to 0.17% in the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in our office real estate portfolio. 

&#8226; The nonperforming loan rate increased by 71 bps to 1.55% as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by credit downgrades. 

Other Category 

Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment securities portfolio, asset/liability management and oversight of our funds transfer pricing process. Other also includes: 

&#8226; unallocated corporate revenue and expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover; 

&#8226; offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; 

&#8226; residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments; and 

&#8226; foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; Loan loss reserves 

&#8226; Goodwill 

&#8226; Fair value 

&#8226; Customer rewards reserve 

We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Form 10-K under &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.&#8221;

Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 

Issued December 2023 

Requires entities to annually provide additional information in the income tax rate reconciliation and make additional disclosures about income taxes paid. Effective beginning with our annual period ending on December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. Prospective application is required and retrospective application is also permitted. We plan to adopt this standard for the above annual period and to apply the new requirements prospectively. We expect such adoption to result in additional information being included in our income tax footnote and consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Segment Reporting Disclosures 

ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 

Issued November 2023 

Requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. Effective beginning with our annual period ending on December 31, 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective application is required. We plan to adopt this standard for the above annual period and to apply the new requirements retrospectively. We are still assessing the extent of the impacts of adoption to the disclosures in our business segment footnote.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. 

Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action 

The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), respectively (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and other capital provisions. 

As a bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) capital regulations. 

Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. 

We have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Prudential Regulation of Banking&#8212;Capital and Stress Testing Regulation&#8212;Basel III Finalization Proposal&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Global systemically important banks (&#8220;G-SIBs&#8221;) that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the &#8220;G-SIB Surcharge.&#8221; We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. 

Stress Capital Buffer Rule 

The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement (&#8220;Stress Capital Buffer Rule&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s &#8220;standardized approach capital conservation buffer&#8221; includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%). Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), hereafter collectively referred to as the &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies,&#8221; set an earlier effective date. 

The Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company&#8217;s supervisory stress test results. In particular, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the Company&#8217;s starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company&#8217;s projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company&#8217;s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Based on the Company&#8217;s 2023 supervisory stress test results, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 was 4.8%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 9.3%, 10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 

Based on the Company&#8217;s 2024 supervisory stress test results, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is 5.5%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC&#8217;s capital regulations, which are only applicable to the Bank, the capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, the Bank&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. 

If the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each &#8220; well-capitalized. &#8221; The &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, and the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC&#8217;s PCA capital requirements. 

CECL Transition Rule 

The Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the &#8220;CECL Transition Rule&#8221;) that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) standard on their regulatory capital (&#8220;CECL Transition Election&#8221;). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. 

Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and the cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. 

Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 

2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 &#8220;Day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25% Phased In 50% Phased In 75% Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL 

As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of $2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we have phased in 75% of this amount as of January 1, 2024. The remaining $600 million will be phased in on January 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio, reflecting the 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

CECL Transition Rule, was 13.6% and would have been 13.4% excluding the impact of the CECL Transition Rule (or &#8220;on a fully phased-in basis&#8221;). 

Market Risk Rule 

The &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See &#8220;Market Risk Profile&#8221; below for additional information. 

For the description of the regulatory capital rules to which we are subject, including recent proposed amendments to these rules under the Basel III Finalization Proposal, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing 

We repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024 and $403 million of shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2024. 

On August 28, 2024, the Federal Reserve confirmed and announced individual stress capital buffer requirements for all large banking institutions, including the Company. The Company&#8217;s final stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is 5.5%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules and stress testing requirements to which we are subject, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital plan rule provides that if a BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since it last submitted the capital plan, it must update and resubmit its capital plan within 30 calendar days, subject to a potential 60-day extension . We determined that our proposed acquisition of Discover constitutes a material change and submitted an updated capital plan as required by the capital plan rule. The capital plan rule further provides that upon the occurrence of an event requiring resubmission, a BHC may not make any capital distribution unless it has received approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, all our capital distributions are now subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve pending the Federal Reserve&#8217;s consideration of our resubmitted capital plan. We have received prior approval of the Federal Reserve to make certain capital distributions.

Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases 

In the first nine months of 2024, we declared and paid common stock dividends of $705 million , or $1.80 per share, and preferred stock dividends of $171 million . Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.60 per share per quarter until the Transaction is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated. 

The following table summarizes the dividends paid per share on our various preferred stock series in the first nine months of 2024.

The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. For additional information related to capital distributions as a result of the capital plan resubmission, see &#8220;Capital Management &#8212; Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing&#8221; in this Report. 

As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit its ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of September 30, 2024, funds available for dividend payments from the Bank were $9.2 billion. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. We repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024 and $403 million of shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2024. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. The Board authorized stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases, tender offers, or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set expiration date and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see &#8220;Capital Management&#8212;Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing,&#8221; and &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 2.

Credit Risk Measurement 

We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. 

We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. 

Table 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(1) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic Card credit scores generally represent Fair Isaac Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. 

(2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. 

In our commercial loan portfolio, we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower&#8217;s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. 

We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4&#8212;Loans&#8221; for additional credit quality information and see &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8.

Delinquency Rates 

We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer&#8217;s due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, repossessed assets and other foreclosed assets. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. 

Table 25 presents our nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Net Charge-Offs 

Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

Financial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers 

A financial difficulty modification (&#8220;FDM&#8221;) occurs when a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of these modifications is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 

As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. 

We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including FDMs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. 

In our Credit Card business, the majority of our FDMs receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. 

In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. 

In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension. A portion of FDMs receive an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of modifications. 

For more information on FDMs, see &#8220;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4&#8212;Loans.&#8221; 

Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

Our allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE 

We manage our funding and liquidity risk in an integrated manner in support of the current and future cash flow needs of our business. We maintained liquidity reserves of $131.6 billion and $120.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as shown in Table 28 below. Included in liquidity reserves are cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had available issuance capacity of $41.0 billion under shelf registrations associated with our credit card and auto loan securitization programs. We also maintain a shelf registration that enables us to issue an indeterminate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. Our ability to issue under each shelf registration is subject to market conditions. 

Finally, as of September 30, 2024, we had access to available contingent liquidity sources totaling $105.8 billion through the prepositioning of collateral, including a portion of the investment securities included in the liquidity reserve amount, at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Standing Repo Facility, FHLB and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&#8212;Government Securities Division (&#8220;FICC&#8212;GSD&#8221;). 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our funding sources totaled $403.0 billion and $398.3 billion, respectively, primarily composed of consumer deposits , as shown in &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition.&#8221; 

Our liquidity reserves, borrowing capacity, contingent liquidity sources and total funding sources are all discussed in more detail in the following sections. 

Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Our liquidity reserves increased by $11.0 billion to $131.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the &#8220;Borrowing Capacity&#8221; and &#8220;Funding&#8221; sections below. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

We are subject to the final rules published by the Basel Committee and as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC for the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) in the United States (the &#8220;LCR Rule&#8221;). The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the third quarter of 2024 was 163% , which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information.

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

We are subject to the final rules published by the Basel Committee and as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC for the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) in the United States (the &#8220;NSFR Rule&#8221;). The NSFR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to maintain an NSFR of 100% on an ongoing basis. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a semi-annual basis each second and fourth quarter, its NSFR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics and qualitative discussion of its NSFR. Our average NSFR for the third quarter of 2024 exceeded the NSFR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of the relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Borrowing Capacity 

We maintain a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $30.0 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25.0 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. As of September 30, 2024, we had $21.6 billion and $19.4 billion of available issuance capacity in our credit card and auto loan securitization programs, respectively. 

In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have collateral pledged to support our access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Standing Repo Facility and FICC&#8212;GSD general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. For each of these programs, the ability to borrow utilizing these sources is dependent on meeting the respective membership requirements. Our borrowing capacity in each program is a function of the collateral the Bank has posted with each counterparty, including any respective haircuts applied to that collateral. 

As of September 30, 2024, we pledged loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $37.0 billion , of which $48 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $18 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

As a member of FICC&#8212;GSD, we had $21.9 billion of readily available borrowing capacity secured by securities from our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024. Our FICC&#8212;GSD membership is supported by our investment in Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (&#8220;DTCC&#8221;) common stock of $412 thousand and $375 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $46.9 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately-capitalized institutions. The Bank was well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits in &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition&#8221; and in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 8&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

Funding 

Our primary source of funding comes from insured retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition&#8221; for additional information on our primary sources of funding. 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 

We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. 

Our short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, typically consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings decreased by $18 million to $520 million as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 driven by a decrease in repurchase agreements. 

Our long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, decreased by $502 million to $48.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 primarily driven by net maturities and paydowns of securitized debt obligations, partially offset by net issuances of unsecured senior debt. We provide more information on our securitization activity in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 6&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations&#8221; and on our borrowings in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 8&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

The following table summarizes issuances of securitized debt obligations, and senior and subordinated notes, and their respective maturities or redemptions for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023.

Credit Ratings 

Our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. For more information, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the heading in our 2023 Form 10-K &#8220;A downgrade in our credit ratings could significantly impact our liquidity, funding costs and access to the capital markets.&#8221; 

Table 31 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation and CONA as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

As of October 25, 2024 Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) and Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;) have our credit ratings on a stable outlook. Following the Company&#8217;s February 19, 2024 announcement to acquire Discover, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) placed our credit ratings on review for a downgrade. Moody&#8217;s said its review for downgrade may continue until the transaction has been completed. 

Other Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into other contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our other contractual obligations include lending commitments, leases, purchase obligations and other contractual arrangements. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our total unfunded lending commitments were $458.9 billion and $441.3 billion, respectively, primarily consisting of credit card lines and loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 14&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others&#8221; in this Report. 

Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf&#233;s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $1.5 billion, in aggregate operating lease obligations. We provide more information on our lease activity in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Premises, Equipment and Leases&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We have purchase obligations that represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify significant terms. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $3.8 billion and $789 million, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligations. This increase is mainly due to recently renewed commitments for certain long term purchase obligations for goods and services. 

We also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 6&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations,&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1.

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

MARKET RISK PROFILE 

Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: 

&#8226; Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; 

&#8226; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; 

&#8226; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and 

&#8226; Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. 

We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts. 

We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates relative to our baseline interest rate forecast on our projected 12-month net interest income. Net interest income sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: 

&#8226; As of September 30, 2024, our metrics assume a market implied baseline interest rate projection for the upper limit of the Federal Funds Target Rate of 4.25% and 3.00% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025, respectively. 

&#8226; In addition to our existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions. These assumptions include loan and deposit growth, pricing, plans for projected changes in our funding mix and our securities and cash position from our internal corporate outlook that is used in our financial planning process. 

&#8226; The analysis assumes this forecast of expected future business growth remains unchanged between the baseline rate forecast and rate shock scenarios, including no changes to our interest rate risk management activities like securities and hedging actions. 

&#8226; We incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit re-pricing, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change, and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. In the contexts used in this section, &#8220;beta&#8221; refers to the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in the federal funds rate. 

&#8226; In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

At the current level of interest rates, our projected 12-month net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. The decrease in lower rate scenarios is driven by lower interest income from our assets, including floating rate credit card and commercial loans, being partially offset by lower interest expense from our deposits and other liabilities, net of our interest rate hedges. Our 12-month net interest income sensitivity increased modestly for the +/- 200 bps scenarios, while the remaining scenarios were largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2023. Increased net interest income sensitivity to large rate shocks is mainly driven by lower interest rates. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Economic value of equity sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: 

&#8226; As of September 30, 2024, our metrics assume a market implied baseline interest rate projection for the upper limit of the Federal Funds Target Rate of 4.25% and 3.00% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025, respectively. 

&#8226; The analysis includes only existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. 

&#8226; Similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure, we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. 

&#8226; Balance attrition assumptions for loans, including credit card, auto and commercial loans, remain unchanged between the baseline interest rate forecast and interest rate shock scenarios as those loans are mainly floating rate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and hence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the level of interest rates. 

&#8226; For assets and liabilities with embedded optionality, such as mortgage securities and deposit balances, we utilize monte carlo simulations to assess economic value with industry-standard term structure modeling of interest rates. 

&#8226; Our calculations of net present value apply appropriate spreads over the benchmark yield curve for select assets and liabilities to capture the inherent risks (including credit risk) to discount expected interest and principal cash flows. 

&#8226; In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. 

Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios. The decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities. The pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity decreased modestly in both higher and lower rate scenarios as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in economic value of equity sensitivity is driven by lower interest rates. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Table 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 1.2 &#160; % 0.7 % +100 basis points 0.9 &#160; 0.8 +50 basis points 0.5 &#160; 0.4 &#8211;50 basis points (0.5) (0.5) &#8211;100 basis points (1.0) (0.9) &#8211;200 basis points (2.6) (2.0) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (7.0) (8.4) +100 basis points (3.0) (3.7) +50 basis points (1.5) (1.8) &#8211;50 basis points 1.2 &#160; 1.6 &#8211;100 basis points 2.2 &#160; 2.9 &#8211;200 basis points 2.4 &#160; 4.0 

In addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as larger rate shocks, higher than +/- 200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. We also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions, such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing. 

Limitations of Market Risk Measures 

The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. 

There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 

For further information on our interest rate exposures, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#8221; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling (&#8220;GBP&#8221;) and the Canadian dollar (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro (&#8220;EUR&#8221;)-denominated borrowings. 

Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 1.2 billion GBP and 973 million GBP as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 1.4 billion CAD and 1.6 billion CAD as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 502 million EUR and 1.3 billion EUR as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet and capital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We manage our translation risk by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion GBP as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and 2.5 billion CAD and 2.4 billion CAD as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. For m ore information, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 10&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity.&#8221; 

Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives 

We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99% confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements&#8212;Note 9&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#8221;

SUPPLEMENTAL TABLE 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

The following non-GAAP measure consists of our adjusted results that we believe helps investors and users of our financial information understand the effect of adjusting items on our selected reported results; however, it may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. This adjusted result provides alternate measurements of our operating performance, both for the current period and trends across multiple periods. The following table presents reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measure below should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The following non-GAAP measures consist of TCE, tangible assets and metrics computed using these amounts, which include tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible assets, return on average TCE and TCE ratio. We consider these metrics to be key financial performance measures that management uses in assessing capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. While these non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The following table presents reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
