Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $15.4 billion, reflecting strong results across our business segments. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROE of 13.1% and ROTCE of 17.5% for the third quarter, and ROE of 13.5% and ROTCE of 18.2% for the year-to-date (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio was 72% for both the third quarter and year-to-date, benefiting from our scale and disciplined expense management while maintaining strong infrastructure to support ongoing growth. 

&#8226; The Firm accreted $2.1 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. At September 30, 2024, the Firm&#8217;s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.1%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $6.8 billion reflect strong performance in Equity and Fixed Income on higher client activity and in Investment Banking on higher underwriting revenues. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax margin of 28.3%. Net revenues of $7.3 billion reflect higher Asset management and Transactional revenues. The business added net new assets of $64 billion in the third quarter and total client assets reached $6 trillion as of September 30, 2024. Fee- based asset flows were $36 billion for the current quarter and total fee-based assets reached $2.3 trillion as of September 30, 2024. 

&#8226; Investment Management results reflect net revenues of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by increased asset management revenues on higher average AUM. The quarter included positive long-term net flows of $7 billion and end-of-period AUM of $1.6 trillion .

Earnings per Diluted Common Share 

We reported net revenues of $15.4 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (&#8220;current quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;3Q 2024&#8221;), which increased by 16% compared with $13.3 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (&#8220;prior year quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;3Q 2023&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest Expenses 

($ in millions) 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,733 million in the current quarter increased 13% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance (&#8220;DCP&#8221;) and an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues. 

Compensation and benefits expenses of $19,889 million in the current year period increased 7% from the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher discretionary incentive compensation on higher revenues, partially offset by lower severance costs. 

During the prior year period, Compensation and benefits expenses included severance costs of $308 million, associated with a reduction in workforce during the second quarter of 2023. This specific reduction in workforce occurred across the Firm&#8217;s business segments and geographic regions, impacted approximately 4% of the Firm&#8217;s global workforce, and resulted from the Firm&#8217;s review of its global workforce, operating expenses and the business environment following the acquisitions of E*TRADE Financial Corporation (&#8220;E*TRADE&#8221;) and Eaton Vance Corp. (&#8220;Eaton Vance&#8221;), rather than a change in strategy or exit of businesses. We recorded severance costs 

of $207 million in the Institutional Securities business segment, $78 million in the Wealth Management business segment, and $23 million in the Investment Management business segment for the prior year period. These costs were primarily incurred in the Americas and EMEA, with the majority in the Americas. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,350 million in the current year quarter increased 7% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend. 

Non-compensation expenses of $12,810 million in the current year period increased 3% from the prior year period, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend, partially offset by lower legal expenses and the absence of integration-related expenses incurred in the prior year period. 

In the prior year period, integration expenses were $244 million, of which $171 million related to the integration of E*TRADE within the Wealth Management business segment and $73 million related to the integration of Eaton Vance within the Investment Management business segment. Integration-related expenses primarily included non-compensation expenses such as information technology expense related to the consolidation of platforms, and professional fees related to changes in legal entity structures and the integration of clients, within both Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. All integration-related activities were substantially completed as of December 31, 2023. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $79 million in the current quarter was primarily related to provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and growth across loan portfolios. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $134 million, primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $149 million in the current year period was primarily related to provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and growth across certain loan portfolios. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $529 million in the prior year period was primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Economic and Market Conditions 

The economic environment, client and investor confidence and overall market sentiment continued to improve in the third quarter of 2024. While inflationary pressures have moderated and interest rates declined, geopolitical risks including ongoing tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. political cycle and the timing and pace of further interest rate reductions present ongoing risks to the economic environment. These factors have impacted, and could continue to impact capital markets and our businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein. 

For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, net of financing costs on DCP investments from net revenues. We also exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP from compensation expenses. The impact of DCP investments and DCP are primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. 

Compensation expense for DCP awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

We invest directly, as principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these DCP awards. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. 

For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Other Matters&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity. The calculation of tangible common equity represents common shareholders&#8217; equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. In addition, we believe that certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity, such as return on average tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) and tangible book value per common share, also non-GAAP financial measures, are useful for evaluating the operating performance and capital adequacy of the business period-to-period, respectively. The calculation of ROTCE represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity. 

2. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. 

ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions.

Investment Banking Revenues 

Revenues of $1,463 million in the current quarter increased 56% from the prior year quarter, reflecting increases across businesses, particularly in Fixed Income underwriting. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues increased primarily due to higher completed M&#38;A activity, particularly in EMEA. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues increased primarily on higher initial public offerings, follow-on offerings and secondary block share trades. 

&#8226; Fixed Income underwriting revenues increased primarily in non-investment and investment grade issuances. 

Revenues of $4,529 million in the current year period increased 39% compared with the prior year period, reflecting increases across businesses, particularly in Fixed Income underwriting. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues increased primarily due to higher completed M&#38;A activity, partially offset by lower fee realizations. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues increased primarily on higher initial public offerings, follow-on offerings and secondary block share trades. 

&#8226; Fixed Income underwriting revenues increased primarily in non-investment and investment grade issuances. 

While Investment Banking results improved from recent quarters, we continue to operate in a market environment with lower completed M&#38;A activity relative to longer-term averages.

1. Includes Commissions and fees and Asset management revenues. 

2. Includes funding costs, which are allocated to the businesses based on funding usage. 

3. Includes Investments and Other revenues. 

Equity 

Net revenues of $3,045 million in the current quarter and $8,905 million in the current year period increased 21% and 14%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, reflecting an increase in both Execution services and Financing, particularly in the Americas and Asia. 

&#8226; Financing revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity and lower funding and liquidity costs. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues increased primarily due to higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity, higher client activity in derivatives and cash equities and mark-to-market gains on business-related investments. 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $2,003 million in the current quarter increased 3% from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in Global macro products, partially offset by a decrease in Commodities. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues increased primarily due to improved results in rates products in a changing rate 

environment driven by central bank activities and gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in foreign exchange products. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased primarily due to lower gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity and decreased client activity compared to elevated results in the prior year quarter, which benefited from higher volatility in energy markets. 

Net revenues of $6,487 million in the current year period increased 4% compared with the prior year period, reflecting an increase in Global macro and Credit products, partially offset by a decrease in Commodities. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues increased primarily due to gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in foreign exchange and rates products. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues increased primarily due to higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity and increased client activity in securitized products. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased primarily due to decreased client activity compared to elevated results in the prior year quarter, which benefited from higher volatility in energy markets. 

Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues were $304 million in the current quarter, compared with $277 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains compared with losses in the prior year quarter on DCP investments and higher contributions from our Japanese securities joint venture, partially offset by higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, inclusive of hedges. 

Other net revenues were $892 million in the current year period compared with $837 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans, higher mark-to-market gains on DCP investments and higher contributions from our Japanese securities joint venture, partially offset by higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, inclusive of hedges. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $68 million in the current quarter was primarily related to growth across loan portfolios and provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $93 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $124 million in the current year period was 

September 2024 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

primarily related to growth across loan portfolios and provisions for certain specific commercial real estate loans. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $379 million in the prior year period, primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,836 million in the current quarter increased 10% compared with the prior year quarter as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation on higher revenues and higher expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily reflecting higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend. 

Non-interest expenses of $14,381 million in the current year period increased 5% compared with the prior year period as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation on higher revenues, partially offset by lower severance costs and lower expenses related to outstanding deferred equity compensation. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend, partially offset by lower legal expenses.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $4,266 million in the current quarter and $12,084 million in the current year period increased 18% and 15%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily reflecting higher fee-based asset levels due to higher market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $1,076 million in the current quarter and $2,891 million in the current year period increased 59% and 17%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily driven by gains on DCP investments and higher client activity. 

For further information on the impact of DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $1,774 million in the current quarter and $5,428 million in the current year period decreased 9% and 13%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to lower average sweep deposits, partially offset by higher yields on our investment portfolio and lending growth. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors have impacted client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and client demand for loans. These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income and to the extent they persist, or others arise, such as further interest rate reductions, net interest income may be further impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $11 million in the current quarter was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate loans, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $41 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $25 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate and securities-based loans, and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. In the prior year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $150 million was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $5,199 million in the current quarter increased 12%, compared with the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expense increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting increased technology spend, higher marketing and business development costs, and higher legal expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expenses. 

September 2024 Form 10-Q 15 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest expenses of $15,230 million in the current year period increased 6%, compared with the prior year period, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased from the prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher expenses related to DCP, partially offset by lower severance costs. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expense decreased from the prior year period, primarily due to the absence of integration-related expenses in the current year period and lower other professional services expenses, partially offset by increased technology spend.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,384 million in the current quarter and $4,072 million in the current year period increased 5% and 6%, respectively, from the prior year periods, primarily driven by higher average AUM on higher market levels from the prior periods. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. While higher market levels drove increases in average AUM in the current quarter, we have continued to see net outflows in the Equity asset class, which may be influenced by the performance of our products relative to their benchmarks, offset by higher net 

inflows in the Alternatives and Solutions and Fixed Income asset classes reflecting client preferences. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $71 million in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher revenues from DCP investments and higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure and real estate funds, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds. 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $146 million in the current year period increased from the prior year period, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure and real estate funds and higher revenues from DCP investments, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,195 million in the current quarter increased 9% from the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP and compensation associated with carried interest. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM and increased technology and infrastructure spend. 

Non-interest expenses of $3,495 million in the current year period increased 5% from the prior year period, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher compensation associated with carried interest and higher discretionary incentive compensation. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM and increased technology and infrastructure spend.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates; however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Income Tax Disclosures. This accounting update requires disclosure of additional information in relation to income taxes, including additional disaggregation of the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. For the income tax rate reconciliation, this update requires (1) disclosure of specific categories of reconciling items; and (2) additional information for reconciling items that are greater than or equal to 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). For income taxes paid, this update requires disclosure of information, including (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Additionally, the update requires disclosure of (1) income (or loss) before income taxes, disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (2) income taxes disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Segment Reporting. This accounting update requires additional reportable segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, primarily about significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss. This update does not change how operating segments are identified or aggregated, or how quantitative thresholds are applied to determine the reportable segments. The accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
