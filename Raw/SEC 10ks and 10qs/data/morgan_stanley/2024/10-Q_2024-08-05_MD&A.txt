Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $15.0 billion, balanced across Wealth Management and Institutional Securities. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROE of 13.0% and ROTCE of 17.5% (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio was 72% for both the second quarter and first half of the year, benefiting from our scale and intentional expense management. 

&#8226; The Firm accreted $1.5 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital while supporting our clients and executing capital actions. At June 30, 2024, the Firm&#8217;s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.2%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $7.0 billion reflect strong performance across the franchise, with notable strength in Equity, driven by higher client activity, and in Investment Banking, on robust debt underwriting results. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax margin of 26.8%. Net revenues were $6.8 billion on higher asset management revenues driven by cumulative fee-based asset flows and a positive market environment. Fee-based asset flows were $26 billion for the second quarter and $52 billion for the first half of the year. The business added net new assets of $36 billion in the quarter and $131 billion in the first half of the year. 

&#8226; Investment Management results reflect net revenues of $1.4 billion, primarily driven by increased asset management revenues on higher long-term average AUM.

Earnings per Diluted Common Share 

We reported net revenues of $15.0 billion in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (&#8220;current quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;2Q 2024&#8221;), which increased by 12% compared with $13.5 billion in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 (&#8220;prior year quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;2Q 2023&#8221;). Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $3.1 billion in the current quarter, which increased by 41% compared with $2.2 billion in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.82, which increased by 47% compared with $1.24 in the prior year quarter. 

We reported net revenues of $30.2 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2024 (&#8220;current year period,&#8221; or &#8220;YTD 2024&#8221;), which increased by 8% compared with $28.0 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 (&#8220;prior year period,&#8221; or &#8220;YTD 2023&#8221;). Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $6.5 billion in the current year period, which increased by 26%, compared with $5.2 billion in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per common share was $3.85, which increased by 31% compared with $2.95 in the prior year period.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest Expenses 

($ in millions) 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,460 million in the current quarter and $13,156 million in the current year period increased 3% and 4%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to higher formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher discretionary compensation on higher revenues. This was partially offset by lower severance costs and lower expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance (&#8220;DCP&#8221;). 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,409 million in the current quarter and $8,460 million in the current year period increased 4% and 1%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend, partially offset by lower legal expenses and professional services expenses. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $76 million in the current quarter was primarily related to provisions for certain specific commercial real estate loans, mainly in the office sector and modest growth in the corporate loan portfolio. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $161 million, primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sector, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $70 million in the current year period was primarily related to provisions for certain specific commercial real estate loans, mainly in the office sector, modest growth in certain corporate and other loan portfolios and provisions for certain specific securities-based loans. The impact was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $395 million in the prior year period was primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sector, modest growth in certain loan portfolios, as well as deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein.

Economic and Market Conditions 

The economic environment, client and investor confidence and overall market sentiment improved in the first half of 2024. However, geopolitical risks, inflation and uncertainty regarding the U.S. political cycle and the future path of interest rates, which have remained high relative to recent years, present ongoing risks to the economic environment. These factors have impacted, and could continue to impact capital markets and our businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein. 

For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, net of financing costs on DCP investments from net revenues. We also exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP from compensation expenses. The impact of DCP investments and DCP are primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying 

June 2024 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

operating performance and revenue trends. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. 

Compensation expense for DCP awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

We invest directly, as principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these DCP awards. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. 

For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Other Matters&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity. The calculation of tangible common equity represents common shareholders&#8217; equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. In addition, we believe that certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity, such as return on average tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) and tangible book value per common share, also non-GAAP financial measures, are useful for evaluating the operating performance and capital adequacy of the business period-to-period, respectively. The calculation of ROTCE represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Other Matters&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 

2. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity. 

3. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. 

ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $3,989 million in the current quarter and $7,818 million in the current year period increased 16% and 14%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily reflecting higher fee-based asset levels in the current quarter due to higher market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $782 million in the current quarter decreased 10% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily driven by losses on DCP investments compared with gains in the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher equity related transactions. 

In the current year period, transactional revenues of $1,815 million increased 1% compared with the prior year period, primarily driven by higher equity related transactions, partially offset by lower gains on DCP investments. 

For further information on the impact of DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $1,798 million in the current quarter and $3,654 million in the current year period decreased 17% and 15%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to changes in deposit mix, partially offset by the net effect of higher interest rates. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors continued to impact client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and client demand for loans. Certain of these factors have impacted our net interest income and to the extent they persist, or others arise, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, net interest income may be further impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $22 million in the current quarter was primarily related to certain specific securities-based loans. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $64 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sector. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $14 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific securities-based and commercial real estate loans, mainly in the office sector. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. In the prior year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $109 million was primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sector, and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,949 million in the current quarter and $10,031 million in the current year period increased 1% and 3%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by lower Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased from the prior year periods, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues, partially offset by lower severance costs and lower expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expense decreased from the prior year periods reflecting lower professional services and legal expenses, partially offset by higher spend on technology.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,342 million in the current quarter and $2,688 million in the current year period increased 6% and 7%, respectively, from the prior year periods, primarily driven by higher average AUM on higher market levels from the prior year periods. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. While higher market levels drove increases in average AUM in the current quarter, we have continued to see net outflows in the Equity asset class, which may be influenced by the performance of our products relative to their benchmarks, partially offset by 

net inflows in the Alternatives and Solutions asset class reflecting client preferences. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $44 million in the current quarter and $75 million in the current year period increased, from the prior year periods, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest in certain private funds, partially offset by lower revenues from DCP investments. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,164 million in the current quarter increased 5% from the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by lower expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to increased technology and infrastructure spend. 

Non-interest expenses of $2,300 million in the current year period increased 3% from the prior year period, as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher expenses related to compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by lower expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM and increased technology and infrastructure spend.

1. Inflows represent investments or commitments from new and existing clients in new or existing investment products, including reinvestments of client dividends and increases in invested capital. Inflows exclude the impact of exchanges, whereby a client changes positions within the same asset class. 

2. Outflows represent redemptions from clients&#8217; funds, transition of funds from the committed capital period to the invested capital period and decreases in invested capital. Outflows exclude the impact of exchanges, whereby a client changes positions within the same asset class. 

3. Market impact includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on portfolio investments. This excludes any funds where market impact does not impact management fees. 

4. Other contains both distributions and foreign currency impact for all periods. Distributions represent decreases in invested capital due to returns of capital after the investment period of a fund. It also includes fund dividends that the client has not reinvested. Foreign currency impact reflects foreign currency changes for non-U.S. dollar dominated funds. 

5. In 2023, our Retail Municipal and Corporate Fixed Income business (&#8220;FIMS&#8221;) was combined with our Parametric retail customized solutions business. The impact of the change was a $6 billion movement in AUM from Fixed Income to the Alternatives and Solutions asset class included in Other.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates; however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Income Tax Disclosures. This accounting update requires disclosure of additional information in relation to income taxes, including additional disaggregation of the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. For the income tax rate reconciliation, this update requires (1) disclosure of specific categories of reconciling items; and (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). For income taxes paid, this update requires disclosure of information, including (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Additionally, the update requires disclosure of (1) income (or loss) before income taxes, disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (2) income taxes disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Segment Reporting. This accounting update requires additional reportable segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, primarily about significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss. This update does not change how operating segments are identified or aggregated, or how quantitative thresholds are applied to determine the reportable segments. The accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
