Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest Expenses 

($ in millions) 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $5,935 million in the current quarter increased 6% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation and higher formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, driven by higher compensable revenues. 

Compensation and benefits expenses of $18,607 million in the current year period increased 7% from the prior year period, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance (&#8220;DCP&#8221;) and higher salary expenses, partially offset by lower discretionary incentive compensation. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,059 million in the current quarter increased 3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by increased spend on technology and higher occupancy expenses. 

Non-compensation expenses of $12,394 million in the current year period increased 3% from the prior year period, primarily driven by increased spend on technology, higher occupancy expenses and higher marketing and business development costs, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $134 million in the current quarter primarily reflects deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $35 million, primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook . 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $529 million in the current year period was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year period was $193 million, primarily due to portfolio growth and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein.

Economic and Market Conditions 

The market environment in aggregate remained mixed, characterized by inflationary pressures and uncertainty regarding the future path of interest rates, which have remained persistently high. This environment has impacted our businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein, and, to the extent that it continues to remain uncertain, could adversely impact client confidence and related activity. 

We are monitoring the war and increased tensions in the Middle East and its impact on the regional economy, as well as on other world economies and the financial markets. Our direct exposure to Israel is limited. Morgan Stanley has a small number of employees in Israel and we continue to support them. 

For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

2. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity. 

3. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of over 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $3,629 million in the current quarter increased 7% when compared with the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher average fee-based asset levels in the current quarter due to higher market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

Asset management revenues of $10,463 million in the current year period decreased 1% when compared with the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower average fee-based asset levels due to declines in the markets, partially offset by the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $678 million in the current quarter increased by $62 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to increased client activity in alternative products . 

In the current year period, transactional revenues of $2,468 million increased by $926 million from the prior year period, primarily driven by gains on DCP investments compared with losses in the prior year period, partially offset by lower client activity. 

For further information on the impact of DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $1,952 million in the current quarter decreased 3% when compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to the net effect of lower brokerage sweep deposits as client preferences continue to evolve, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. 

Net interest revenues of $6,266 million in the current year period increased 18% when compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the net effect of higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of lower brokerage sweep deposits. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors continued to impact client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and the pace of reallocation of client balances, resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense, as well as client demand for loans. If these trends persist, net interest income may continue to be impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $41 million in the current quarter primarily reflects deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $11 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the commercial real estate portfolio. 

In the current year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $150 million was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $43 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and portfolio growth in Residential real estate loans. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,654 million in the current quarter increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher expenses in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues, higher salaries and higher expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged compared with the prior year quarter. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

In the current year period, Non-interest expenses increased 11% to $14,371 million compared with the prior year period, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP, higher salaries and severance costs associated with the employee action in the second quarter. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period primarily driven by increased spend on technology, professional services and occupancy. 

For further information on the impact of expenses related to DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,312 million in the current quarter increased 3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average AUM due to the increase in asset values from the prior year quarter. 

Asset management and related fees of $3,828 million in the current year period decreased 3% from the prior year period primarily due to lower average AUM driven by the decline in asset values and the cumulative effect of net outflows in Long-Term AUM. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. The market environment in recent quarters has led to a decline in asset prices, which in turn, negatively impacted our average Long-Term AUM level across asset classes. To the extent the market condition deteriorates further, or we continue to see net outflows of Long-Term AUM, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be negatively impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues were $24 million in the current quarter, compared with losses of $101 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest and investment gains in certain private equity funds. 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $78 million in the current year period increased, primarily due to DCP investments and public investments, partially offset by reduced carried interest in infrastructure funds. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,095 million in the current quarter increased 4% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher expenses related to compensation associated with carried interest. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily as a result of higher fee sharing paid to intermediaries on higher average AUM. 

Non-interest expenses of $3,329 million in the current year period, remained relatively unchanged from the prior year period. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively unchanged for the current year period as a result of lower expenses related to compensation associated with carried interest, offset by higher expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged for the current year period.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting update, however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Investments&#8212;Tax Credit Structures . This accounting update permits an election to account for tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The update requires a separate accounting policy election to be made for each tax credit program. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. The amortization of the investment and the income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recognized net in the income statement as a component of provision for income taxes. The update also requires disclosures of certain information that enable investors and other users of our financial statements to understand the nature of (i) the tax equity investments in projects that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a program for which the proportional amortization method has been elected and (ii) the impact of the tax equity investments and related income tax credits on the financial condition and results of operations. The accounting update will be effective January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters
