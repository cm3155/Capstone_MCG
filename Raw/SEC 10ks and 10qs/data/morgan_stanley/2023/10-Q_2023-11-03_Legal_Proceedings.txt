Block Trading Matter 

The Firm has been responding to requests for information from the Enforcement Division of the SEC and the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with their investigations into various aspects of the Firm's blocks business, certain related sales and trading practices, and applicable controls (the &#8220;Investigations&#8221;). The Investigations are focused on whether the Firm and/or its employees shared and/or used information regarding impending block transactions in violation of federal securities laws and regulations. The Firm continues to cooperate with, and has continued to engage in ongoing discussions regarding potential resolution of, the Investigations. There can be no assurance that these discussions and continuing engagement will lead to resolution of either matter. The Firm also faces potential civil liability arising from claims that have been or may be asserted by, among others, block transaction participants who contend they were harmed or disadvantaged including, among other things, as a result of a share price decline allegedly caused by the activities of the Firm and/or its employees, or as a result of the Firm&#8217;s and/or its employees&#8217; failure to adhere to applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the Firm has responded to demands from shareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records concerning the Investigations.

On September 1, 2023, the court in Iowa Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System et al. v. Bank of America Corporation et al. granted preliminary approval of the settlement. 

The Firm is a defendant in three antitrust class action complaints which have been consolidated into one proceeding in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption City of Philadelphia, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm, along with a number of other financial institution defendants, violated U.S. antitrust laws and relevant state laws in connection with alleged efforts to artificially inflate interest rates for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (&#8220;VRDO&#8221;). Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, treble damages. The class action complaint was filed on behalf of a class of municipal issuers of VRDO for which defendants served as remarketing agent. On November 2, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, dismissing state law claims, but denying dismissal of the U.S. antitrust claims. On September 21, 2023, the court granted plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification. On October 5, 2023, defendants sought leave to appeal this ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
