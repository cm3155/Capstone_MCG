Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk &#160; 

Risk Management 

Overview 

Risk is an inherent part of our businesses and activities. We believe effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. Accordingly, we have an Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the Firm. 

We have policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, monitor, advise, challenge and control the principal risks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The principal risks involved in our business activities include market (including non-trading risks), credit, operational, model, compliance, cybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, reputational and conduct risk. Strategic risk is integrated into our business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by the Board. 

The cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is implemented through the ERM framework. Five key principles underlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and transparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires 

&#160;

thorough and frequent communication and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires us to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement. 

Our risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is willing to accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives and business plan, taking into account the interests of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk limits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board (&#8220;BRC&#8221;) and the Board on at least an annual basis. 

Risk Governance Structure 

Risk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-level oversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective communication of risk matters across the Firm, to senior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk governance structure is set forth in the following chart and also includes risk managers, committees, and groups within and across business segments and operating legal entities. The ERM framework, composed of independent but complementary entities, facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes.

Morgan Stanley Board of Directors 

The Board has oversight of the ERM framework and is responsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in a sound manner. The Board has authorized the committees within the ERM framework to help facilitate our risk oversight responsibilities. As set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, the Board also oversees, and receives reports on, our financial performance, strategy and business plans, as well as our practices and procedures relating to reputational and franchise risk, and culture, values and conduct. 

Risk Committee of the Board 

The BRC assists the Board in its oversight of the ERM framework; oversees major risk exposures of the Firm, including market, credit, model and liquidity risk, against established risk measurement methodologies and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; oversees our risk appetite statement, including risk limits and tolerances; reviews capital, liquidity and funding strategy and related guidelines and policies; reviews the contingency funding plan and capital planning process; oversees our significant risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies; oversees the performance of the Chief Risk Officer; reviews reports from our Strategic Transactions Committee, CCAR Committee and RRP Committee; reviews new product risk, emerging risks and regulatory matters; and reviews the Internal Audit Department reports on the assessment of the risk management, liquidity and capital functions. The BRC reports to the Board on a regular basis and coordinates with other Board committees with respect to oversight of risk management and risk assessment guidelines. 

Audit Committee of the Board 

The Audit Committee of the Board (&#8220;BAC&#8221;) oversees the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and system of internal controls; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the Board, the BRC, and the Operations and Technology Committee of the Board (&#8220;BOTC&#8221;); reviews the major legal and compliance risk exposures of the Firm and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; selects, determines the fees, evaluates and, when appropriate, replaces the independent auditor; oversees the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditor and pre-approves audit and permitted non-audit services; oversees the performance of our Global Audit Director; and, after review, recommends to the Board the acceptance and inclusion of the annual audited financial statements in the Firm&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K. The BAC reports to the Board on a regular basis. 

Operations and Technology Committee of the Board 

The BOTC oversees our operations and technology strategy and significant investments in support of such strategy; operations, 

&#160;

technology and operational risk, including information security, fraud, vendor, data protection, business continuity and cybersecurity risks, and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; and risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the Board, BRC and BAC, and policies regarding operations, technology and operational risk. The BOTC reports to the Board on a regular basis. 

Firm Risk Committee 

The Board has also authorized the Firm Risk Committee (&#8220;FRC&#8221;), a management committee appointed and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer, to help oversee the ERM framework. The FRC&#8217;s responsibilities include: oversight of our risk management principles, procedures and limits; the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, operational, model, liquidity, legal, compliance and reputational risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate; and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC also establishes and communicates risk tolerance, including aggregate Firm limits and tolerances, as appropriate. The Governance Process Review Subcommittee of the FRC oversees governance and process issues on behalf of the FRC. The FRC reports to the Board, the BAC, the BOTC and the BRC through the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer. 

Functional Risk and Control Committees 

Functional risk and control committees and other committees within the ERM framework facilitate efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes. 

Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies, procedures, controls and systems that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, our aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of our risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls. 

Chief Risk Officer 

The Chief Risk Officer, who is independent of business units, reports to the BRC and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Risk Officer oversees compliance with our risk limits; approves exceptions to our risk limits; independently reviews material market, credit, liquidity, model and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the BRC and the BAC, as appropriate. The Chief Risk Officer also coordinates with the Chief Financial Officer regarding

##TABLE_END

capital and liquidity management and works with the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board to help ensure that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. 

Independent Risk Management Functions 

The risk management functions (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk Management departments) are independent of our business units and report to the Chief Risk Officer. These functions assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controlling our risk through a number of control processes. Each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. Further discussion about the responsibilities of the risk management functions may be found under &#8220;Market Risk,&#8221; &#8220;Credit Risk,&#8221; &#8220;Operational Risk,&#8221; &#8220;Model Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; herein. 

Support and Control Groups 

Our support and control groups include the Legal and Compliance Division, the Finance Division, Technology Division, Operations Division, the Human Resources Department, Corporate Services and Firm Resilience. Our support and control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; each business segment&#8217;s market, credit and operational risk profile; liquidity risks; model risks; sales practices; reputational, legal enforceability, compliance, conduct and regulatory risk; and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review. 

Internal Audit Department 

The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment. The Internal Audit Department provides an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of our control environment and risk management processes using a risk-based audit coverage model and audit execution methodology developed from professional auditing standards. The Internal Audit Department also reviews and tests our compliance with internal guidelines set for risk management and risk monitoring, as well as external rules and regulations governing the industry. It effects these responsibilities through periodic reviews (with specified minimum frequency) of our processes, activities, products or information systems; targeted reviews of specific controls and activities; pre-implementation or initiative reviews of new or significantly changed processes, activities, products or information systems; and special investigations and retrospective reviews required as a result of 

&#160;

internal factors or regulatory requests. In addition to regular reports to the BAC, the Global Audit Director, who reports functionally to the BAC and administratively to the Chief Executive Officer, periodically reports to the BRC and BOTC on risk-related control issues. 

Culture, Values and Conduct of Employees 

Employees of the Firm are accountable for conducting themselves in accordance with our core values: Putting Clients First, Doing the Right Thing, Leading with Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back . We are committed to reinforcing and confirming adherence to our core values through our governance framework, tone from the top, management oversight, risk management and controls, and three lines of defense structure (business, control functions such as Risk Management and Compliance, and Internal Audit). 

The Board is responsible for overseeing the Firm&#8217;s practices and procedures relating to culture, values and conduct, as set forth in the Firm&#8217;s Corporate Governance Policies. Our Culture, Values and Conduct Committee is the senior management committee that oversees the Firmwide culture, values and conduct program. A fundamental building block of this program is the Firm&#8217;s Code of Conduct, which establishes standards for employee conduct that further reinforce the Firm&#8217;s commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. Every new hire and every employee annually must certify to their understanding of and adherence to the Code of Conduct. The Firm&#8217;s Global Conduct Risk Management Policy also sets out a consistent global framework for managing Conduct Risk ( i.e ., the risk arising from misconduct by employees or contingent workers) and Conduct Risk incidents at the Firm. 

The employee annual performance review process includes evaluation of employee conduct related to risk management practices and the Firm&#8217;s expectations. We also have several mutually reinforcing processes to identify employee conduct that may have an impact on employment status, current year compensation and/or prior year compensation. For example, the Global Incentive Compensation Discretion Policy sets forth standards for managers when making annual compensation decisions and specifically provides that managers must consider whether their employees effectively managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the performance year. Management committees from control functions periodically meet to discuss employees whose conduct is not in line with our expectations. These results are incorporated into identified employees&#8217; performance reviews and compensation and promotion decisions. 

The Firm&#8217;s clawback and cancellation provisions apply to deferred incentive compensation and cover a broad scope of employee conduct, including any act or omission (including with respect to direct supervisory responsibilities) that constitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm or causes a restatement of the Firm&#8217;s financial results, constitutes a violation

of the Firm&#8217;s global risk management principles, policies and standards, or causes a loss of revenue associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of internal control policies. 

Risk Limits Framework 

Risk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for monitoring risk taking activity and avoiding outsized risk taking. Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm&#8217;s capital planning process where losses are estimated under the Firm&#8217;s BHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We also maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quantitative metrics to support and implement our risk appetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between the overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and more granular risk-taking decisions and activities. 

Risk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis, with more frequent updates as necessary. Board-level risk limits address the most important Firmwide aggregations of risk, including, but not limited to, stressed market, credit and liquidity risks. Additional risk limits approved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and are bound by the higher-level Board risk limits. 

Risk Management Process 

In subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management policies and procedures for our primary risks. This discussion primarily focuses on our Institutional Securities business segment's trading activities and corporate lending and related activities. We believe that these activities generate a substantial portion of our primary risks. These sections and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses are forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other factors described in the following paragraphs. 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading 

&#160;

market risk from capital investments in alternative and other funds. 

Market risk includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-trading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts classified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the banking book. 

Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. 

To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis systems. Market risk is also monitored through various measures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors and scenarios designed by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board. 

Trading Risks 

Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management 

During 2019, we had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices&#8212;and the associated implied volatilities and spreads&#8212;related to the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. 

We are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of our market-making activities and other trading in interest rate-sensitive financial instruments ( e.g ., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which we are active include, but are not limited to, the following: derivatives, and corporate and government debt across both developed and emerging markets and asset-backed debt, including mortgage-related securities. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

December 2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Risk Disclosures 

##TABLE_END

We are exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions, including positions in non-public entities. Positions in non-public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities. 

We are exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non-U.S. dollar-denominated financial instruments. 

We are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities in commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production and transportation; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities. 

We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products ( e.g ., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. 

We manage the market risk associated with our trading activities on a Firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. We manage and monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects our aggregate risk tolerance as established by our senior management. 

Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm across all divisions worldwide. Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by our senior management. 

Value-at-Risk 

The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department 

&#160;

calculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to various levels of management. 

Beginning July 1, 2019, we estimate VaR using a model based on a one-year equal weighted historical simulation for general market risk factors and name-specific risk in corporate shares and related derivatives, and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model constructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. 

Prior to July 1, 2019, our VaR model used four years of historical data with a volatility adjustment to reflect current market conditions. 

VaR for risk management purposes (&#8220;Management VaR&#8221;) is computed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time horizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The 95%/one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. 

Our VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-linear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and non-linear exposures to implied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks ( e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives). 

We use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio&#8217;s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However, VaR has various limitations, which include, but are not limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR. 

##TABLE_START December 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Risk Disclosures 

##TABLE_END

The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis and control at the trading desk, division and Firm levels. 

Our VaR model evolves over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR model&#8217;s ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. 

Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated in the following tables and paragraphs or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95%/one-day VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount. 

VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the firms&#8217; portfolios, modeling assumptions and methodologies. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. The impact of such differences varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm&#8217;s risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms. 

Our regulators have approved the same VaR model we use for risk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations. 

The portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs from that used for Regulatory VaR. Management VaR contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR. Examples include counterparty CVA and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges. 

The following table presents the Management VaR for the Trading portfolio, on a period-end, annual average, and annual 

&#160;

high and low basis. To further enhance the transparency of the traded market risk, the Credit Portfolio VaR has been disclosed as a separate category from the Primary Risk Categories. The Credit Portfolio includes counterparty CVA and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.

Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.

The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.

2018 amounts have been revised to present the results of the new VaR model, in conformance with the 2019 presentation. The difference between the VaR measures produced by the new and old models was not significant. 

##TABLE_END Average total Management VaR remained relatively unchanged from 2018. Average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories decreased from 2018 as reduced interest rate and credit spread risk was offset by increased Commodity and Foreign Exchange risk within the Fixed Income Division. 

Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues 

One method of evaluating the reasonableness of our VaR model as a measure of our potential volatility of net revenues is to compare VaR with corresponding actual trading revenues. Assuming no intraday trading, for a 95%/one-day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the adequacy of the VaR model would be questioned.

##TABLE_END

We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model&#8217;s accuracy relative to realized trading results. There were no days in 2019 on which trading losses exceeded VaR.

Certain items such as fees, commissions and net interest income are excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading.

The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity. 

We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors. The change in sensitivity to interest rates between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is primarily driven by lower market rates and changes in our asset-liability profile.

MUMSS&#8212;Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. 

We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance-based fees, as applicable. The change in investments sensitivity related to Investment Management activities between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is primarily driven by higher unrealized carried interest and investment gains, primarily from an Asia private equity fund. 

Equity Market Sensitivity 

In the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, certain fee-based revenue streams are driven by the value of clients&#8217; equity holdings. The overall level of revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of the equity market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions, and the impact of such market increase or decline and price volatility on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the equity markets. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We primarily incur credit risk to institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments. 

We incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

extending credit to clients through loans and lending commitments; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties may have obligations to make payments to us; 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the repayment amount; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to support our clearing and settlement obligations; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans. 

##TABLE_END We incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

margin loans collateralized by securities; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending, to high net worth clients; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming, non-conforming or HELOC form, primarily to existing Wealth Management clients; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

employee loans granted primarily to recruit certain Wealth Management representatives. 

##TABLE_END Monitoring and Control 

In order to help protect us from losses, the Credit Risk Management Department (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) establishes Firmwide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. CRM approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and helps ensure that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within CRM and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals from CRM. A comprehensive and global Credit Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk tolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry and product type. 

CRM helps ensure timely and transparent communication of material credit risks, compliance with established limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. CRM also works closely with the Market Risk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk

exposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze and control credit risk concentrations arising from lending and trading activities. The stress tests shock market factors ( e.g. , interest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters ( e.g. , default probabilities and loss given default), recovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. Stress tests are conducted in accordance with our established policies and procedures. 

Credit Evaluation 

The evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and borrowers includes assigning credit ratings, which reflect an assessment of an obligor&#8217;s probability of default and loss given default. Credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization; access to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and, in the case of certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service requirements. CRM also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, management and other factors that could affect the obligor&#8217;s risk profile. Additionally, CRM evaluates the relative position of our exposure in the borrower&#8217;s capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as other structural elements of the particular transaction. 

The evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the specific type of lending. Securities-based loans are evaluated based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the loan and the amount, quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral. The underwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor&#8217;s debt-to-income ratio, net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and industry standard credit scoring models ( e.g. , FICO scores). Subsequent credit monitoring for individual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis. 

Credit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the evaluation process are incorporated into CRM maintenance of the allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment. Such allowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified as impaired. For more information on the allowance for loan losses, see Notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements. 

&#160;

Risk Mitigation 

We may seek to mitigate credit risk from our lending and trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions, guarantees and hedges. At the transaction level, we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, financial covenants, seniority and collateral. We actively hedge our lending and derivatives exposures. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products ( e.g ., futures, forwards, swaps, and options). Additionally, we may sell, assign or syndicate loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan markets. 

In connection with our derivatives trading activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master agreement in the event of a counterparty default. A collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information about our collateralized transactions.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 1. 

Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment advisor and manager. At December 31, 2019 , loans held at fair value are the result of the consolidation of a CLO, managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured corporate loans. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. 

Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3. 

Beginning in 2019, loans previously referred to as Wholesale real estate are referred to as Commercial real estate. 

##TABLE_END We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements. In 2019 , total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $30 billion , primarily in Corporate within the Institutional Securities business segment due to growth in secured lending facilities and increases in event-driven lending commitments. Also contributing to the increase was growth in Consumer securities-based lending, Residential real estate loans and tailored lending within the Wealth Management business segment. 

See Notes 3 , 4 , 8 and 13 to the financial statements for further information.

&#160;

Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrower&#8217;s financial strength, industry, facility structure, loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered. 

The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased during 2019 , primarily within the Institutional Securities business segment due to loan and lending commitment growth, deterioration of select credits and certain environmental factors. See Notes 8 and 13 to the financial statements for further information.

The principal Institutional Securities business segment lending activities include Corporate and Commercial real estate loans. Our loans and lending commitments may have varying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by us. 

We also extend short- and long-term secured lending facilities with various types of collateral, including residential real estate, commercial real estate, corporate and financial assets. These 

&#160;

collateralized loans and lending commitments generally provide for overcollateralization. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and/or a decline in the underlying collateral value. The Firm monitors collateral levels against the requirements of lending agreements. In addition, we participate in securitization activities whereby we transfer certain loans, primarily Commercial real estate, to an SPE, which in turn securitizes the loans. See Note 14 to the financial statements for information about our securitization activities.

##TABLE_END

The principal Wealth Management business segment lending activities include securities-based lending and residential real estate loans. 

Securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose other than purchasing securities. We establish approved credit lines against qualifying securities and monitor limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the right to not make any advances or may terminate these credit lines at any time. Factors considered in the review of these loans include, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the client&#8217;s credit profile, the degree of leverage, collateral diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral. 

Residential real estate loans consist of first and second lien mortgages, including HELOCs. Our underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis utilizing industry standard credit scoring models ( e.g. , FICO scores), debt-to-income ratios and assets of the borrower. Loan-to-value ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisals and valuations, and security lien positions are established through title and ownership reports. The vast majority of mortgage loans, including HELOCs, are held for investment in the Wealth Management business segment&#8217;s loan portfolio. 

&#160;

In 2019 , Loans and Lending commitments associated with the Wealth Management business segment increased by approximately 13% , primarily due to growth in Securities-based lending, Residential real estate loans, and tailored lending.

The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements, which allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. Margin lending activities generally have minimal credit risk due to the value of collateral held and their short-term nature. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage.

In 2019, the balance of employee loans decreased as a result of the roll-off of certain acquisition-related employee retention loans and repayments, partially offset by new note issuances. Employee loans are granted in conjunction with a program established primarily to recruit certain Wealth Management representatives, are full recourse and generally require periodic repayments. We establish an allowance for loan amounts we do not consider recoverable, and the related provision is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense.

Counterparty credit ratings are determined internally by CRM. 

##TABLE_END We incur credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. For a description of our risk mitigation strategies, see &#8220; Credit Risk&#8212;Risk Mitigation &#8221; herein. 

&#160;

Credit Derivatives 

A credit derivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one or more debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one or more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium and restructuring. 

We trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities. In transactions referencing a portfolio of entities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of exposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market maker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to manage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. 

We actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties are composed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may include provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in the counterparty posting additional collateral to us. As with all derivative contracts, we consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and recognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading revenues in the income statements. 

For additional credit exposure information on our credit derivative portfolio, see Note 5 to the financial statements. 

Country Risk 

Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. 

Our obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indirect exposures, whereby an obligor has vulnerability or exposure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of indirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single country, offshore companies whose assets reside in another country to that of the offshore jurisdiction and finance company subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposures identified through the credit

&#160; 

Risk Disclosures 

##TABLE_END

evaluation process may result in a reclassification of country risk. 

We conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on our credit and market exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. When deemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects and second order risks. This analysis, and results of the stress tests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation. 

Our sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into primarily with corporations and financial institutions. Index credit derivatives are included in the following country risk exposure table. Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity&#8217;s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure row based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable or payable is reflected in the Net Inventory row based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

Country Risk Exposures Related to the U.K. 

At December 31, 2019 , our country risk exposures in the U.K. included net exposures of $18,070 million (as shown in the Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures table) and overnight deposits of $6,378 million . The $19,488 million of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors and include $6,804 million to U.K.-focused counterparties that generate more than one-third of their revenues in the U.K., $4,817 million to geographically diversified counterparties, and $5,946 million to exchanges and clearinghouses. 

In addition to our country risk exposure, we disclose our cross-border risk exposure in &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Financial Data Supplement (Unaudited).&#8221;

Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities ( e.g ., sales and trading) and support and control groups ( e.g. , information technology and trade processing). 

We have established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Firm. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the Firm and to respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. 

We have implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, to assess business environment and internal control factors, and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while external operational incidents, business environment and internal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario analysis process. 

In addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and mitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These include a governance framework, a comprehensive risk management program and insurance. Operational risks and associated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk tolerance reviewed and confirmed by the Board and are prioritized accordingly. 

The breadth and range of operational risk are such that the types of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of activities include: continuous enhancement of defenses against cyber

attacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to transfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due diligence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures; technology change management controls; exception management processing controls; and segregation of duties. 

Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managers therein. The business managers maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business segments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports to our senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk matters with our senior management. Oversight of operational risk is provided by the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk committees and senior management. In the event of a merger; joint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or creation of a new legal entity, a new product, or a business activity, operational risks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes or controls are implemented. 

The Operational Risk Department provides independent oversight of operational risk and assesses, measures and monitors operational risk against tolerance. The Operational Risk Department works with the divisions and control groups to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Firm. 

The Operational Risk Department scope includes oversight of technology risk, cybersecurity risk, information security risk, the fraud risk management and prevention program, and third-party risk management (supplier and affiliate risk oversight and assessment). 

Cybersecurity 

Our cybersecurity and information security policies, procedures, and technologies are designed to protect our own, our client and our employee data against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse and are also designed to address regulatory requirements. These policies and procedures cover a broad range of areas, including: identification of internal and external threats, access control, data security, protective controls, detection of malicious or unauthorized activity, incident response and recovery planning. 

Business Continuity Management and Disaster Recovery 

We maintain global programs for business continuity management and technology disaster recovery that facilitate activities designed to mitigate our risk during a business continuity event. A business continuity event is an interruption with potential impact to normal business activity of our people, 

&#160;

operations, technology, suppliers and/or facilities. The business continuity management program&#8217;s core functions are business continuity planning and crisis management. As part of business continuity planning, our business units maintain business continuity plans, identifying processes and strategies to continue business-critical processes during a business continuity event. Crisis management is the process of identifying and managing our operations during business continuity events. Disaster recovery plans supporting business continuity are in place for critical technology assets and systems across the Firm. 

Third Party Risk Management 

In connection with our ongoing operations, we utilize the services of third party suppliers, which we anticipate will continue and may increase in the future. These services include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and other professional services. Our risk-based approach to managing exposure to these services includes the performance of due diligence, implementation of service level and other contractual agreements, consideration of operational risks and ongoing monitoring of third-party suppliers&#8217; performance. We maintain and continue to enhance our third-party risk management program which includes appropriate governance, policies, procedures and technology that supports alignment with our risk tolerance and is designed to meet regulatory requirements. The third-party risk management program includes the adoption of appropriate risk management controls and practices through the supplier management life cycle, including, but not limited to, assessment of information security, service failure, financial stability, disaster recoverability, reputational risk, contractual risk and safeguards against corruption. 

Model Risk 

Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. 

Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy. 

Sound model risk management is an integral part of our Risk Management Framework. The Model Risk Management Department (&#8220;MRM&#8221;) is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the oversight of model risk. 

MRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage due to errors in design, implementation and/or inappropriate use of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-specific

and aggregate business-level assessments, which are based upon qualitative and quantitative factors. 

A guiding principle for managing model risk is the &#8220;effective challenge&#8221; of models. The effective challenge of models is defined as critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate changes. MRM provides effective challenge of models, independently validates and approves models for use, annually recertifies models, identifies and tracks remediation plans for model limitations and reports on model risk metrics. The department also oversees the development of controls to support a complete and accurate Firmwide model inventory. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. Liquidity risk also encompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities. 

Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and to withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk Department is a distinct area in Risk Management responsible for the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. 

To execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Department establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and reports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews the methodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios. 

The Treasury Department and applicable business units have primary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and controlling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our business activities and for maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury Department and these business units to help ensure a consistent and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and 

&#160;

funding risk across the Firm. See also &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

Legal and Compliance Risk 

Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty&#8217;s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;). 

We have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty&#8217;s performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
